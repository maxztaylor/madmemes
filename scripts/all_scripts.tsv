Old Gold man, huh?	1	1
Lucky Strike here.	1	1
Can I ask you a question? Why do you smoke Old Gold?	1	1
I'm sorry, sir. Is Sam here bothering you?	1	1
He can be a little chatty.	1	1
No, we're actually just having a conversation.	1	1
Is that okay?	1	1
Can I get you another drink?	1	1
Yeah. Do this again. Old-fashioned, please.	1	1
So you obviously need to relax	1	1
after working here all night.	1	1
 I guess. I don't know.	1	1
But what is it? I mean, low-tar?	1	1
Those new filters?	1	1
Why... I mean... Why Old Gold?	1	1
They gave 'em to us in the service...	1	1
A carton a week for free.	1	1
So you're used to 'em, is that it?	1	1
Yeah. They're a habit.	1	1
I could never get you to try another brand...	1	1
Say, my Luckies?	1	1
I love my Old Golds.	1	1
All right, well, let's just say tomorrow	1	1
a tobacco weevil comes	1	1
and eats every last Old Gold on the planet.	1	1
That's a sad story.	1	1
It's a tragedy.	1	1
Would you just stop smoking?	1	1
I think I could find something.	1	1
I love smoking.	1	1
"""I love smoking."" That's very good."	1	1
My wife hates it.	1	1
Reader's Digest says it will kill you.	1	1
Yeah, I heard about that.	1	1
Ladies love their magazines.	1	1
Yes, they do.	1	1

You weren't worried about waking me, were you?	1	1
Am I interrupting anything?	1	1
Mmm, no.	1	1
You're lucky I'm still up working	1	1
and I'm alone.	1	1
How's it going?	1	1
They invented something called Grandmother's Day.	1	1
That ought to keep me busy drawing puppies	1	1
for a few months.	1	1
Can I run a few ideas past you?	1	1
Does that mean what I think it means?	1	1
Because I'm familiar with most of your ideas.	1	1
I'm having a situation with my cigarette account.	1	1
Wow, you really are here to talk.	1	1
The Trade Commission is cracking down	1	1
on all of our health claims.	1	1
I get Reader's Digest.	1	1
This is the same scare you had five years ago.	1	1
You dealt with it.	1	1
I know I slept a lot better,	1	1
knowing doctors smoke.	1	1
Well, that's just it.	1	1
"The whole ""safer cigarette"" thing is over."	1	1
No more doctors, no more testimonials,	1	1
no more cough-free, soothes your T-zone,	1	1
low-tar, low-nicotine, filter tip.	1	1
Nothing.	1	1
All I have is a crush-proof box	1	1
"and ""four out of five dead people smoke your brand."""	1	1
Is this the part where I say,	1	1
"""Don Draper is the greatest ad man ever,"	1	1
"""and his big, strong brain will find a way"	1	1
"to lead the sheep to the slaughterhouse""?"	1	1
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.	1	1
You gonna pitch to me or not?	1	1
Midge, I'm serious. I have nothing.	1	1
I am over, and they're finally gonna know it.	1	1
Next time you see me,	1	1
there will be a bunch of young executives	1	1
picking meat off my ribs.	1	1
That's a pretty picture.	1	1
What's your secret?	1	1
Nine different ways to say...	1	1
"""I love you, Grandma."""	1	1
We should get married.	1	1
You think I'd make a good ex-wife?	1	1
I'm serious.	1	1
You have your own business.	1	1
You don't mind when I come over.	1	1
What size Cadillac do you take?	1	1
You know the rules.	1	1
I don't make plans,	1	1
and I don't make breakfast.	1	1
Sterling's having the tobacco people in in nine hours,	1	1
and I have nothing.	1	1
People love smoking.	1	1
There's nothing that you, the Trade Commission,	1	1
or Reader's Digest can do to change that.	1	1
There's this kid who comes by my office every day,	1	1
looks where he's gonna put his plants.	1	1
Is he handsome?	1	1
23.	1	1
Uh, not right away.	1	1
Pal, could you take the long way up?	1	1
I am really enjoying the view here.	1	1
You going to Campbell's bachelor party?	1	1
Yeah, I want to be there	1	1
before they tie an anchor around his neck	1	1
and drag him out to sea.	1	1
I hear she's a nice girl.	1	1
Eh, who wants that?	1	1
What did you do that for?	1	1
She'll probably be assigned to one of us.	1	1
Then she'll know what she's in for.	1	1
You got to let them know what kind of guy you are.	1	1
Then they'll know what kind of girl to be.	1	1
I have a feeling we won't be going	1	1
to your bachelor party soon.	1	1
Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,	1	1
I'm a Boy Scout.	1	1
Excuse me. Is he expecting you?	1	1
He's not expecting anything.	1	1
Oh, honey, don't worry. I'll get home safely.	1	1
I have an important appointment right now,	1	1
so why don't you go shopping or something?	1	1
Take your mother to lunch.	1	1
Tell her it was my idea.	1	1
Wow. He's good.	1	1
It's just a bachelor party, dear.	1	1
No, I really don't know what they have planned,	1	1
but judging from the creative brain power around here,	1	1
we'll probably end up seeing My Fair Lady.	1	1
I'll tell you what.	1	1
I'll drop by your place on my way home.	1	1
Your mother can check under my fingernails.	1	1
Of course I love you.	1	1
I'm giving up my life to be with you, aren't I?	1	1
What a great gal.	1	1
Tell ya, boys,	1	1
she stole my heart.	1	1
And her old man's loaded.	1	1
Now, this is the executive floor.	1	1
It should be organized, but it's not,	1	1
so you'll find account executives	1	1
and creative executives all mixed in together.	1	1
Please don't ask me the difference.	1	1
Great.	1	1
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,	1	1
you can avoid some of the mistakes I've made here.	1	1
Hello, Joan. Like that one.	1	1
So how many trains did it take you?	1	1
Only one, but I got up very early.	1	1
In a couple of years, with the right moves,	1	1
you'll be in the city with the rest of us.	1	1
Of course, if you really make the right moves,	1	1
you'll be out in the country,	1	1
and you won't be going to work at all.	1	1
You'll be here just across the aisle from me.	1	1
We'll both take care of Mr. Draper for the time being.	1	1
I don't know what your goals are,	1	1
but don't overdo it with the perfume.	1	1
Keep a fifth of something in your desk.	1	1
Mr. Draper drinks rye.	1	1
Also, invest in some aspirin, Band-Aids,	1	1
and a needle and thread.	1	1
Rye is Canadian, right?	1	1
You better find out.	1	1
He may act like he wants a secretary,	1	1
but most of the time,	1	1
they're looking for something	1	1
between a mother and a waitress.	1	1
And the rest of the time, well...	1	1
Go home, take a paper bag,	1	1
and cut some eyeholes out of it.	1	1
Put it over your head, get undressed,	1	1
and look at yourself in the mirror.	1	1
Really evaluate where your strengths and weaknesses are,	1	1
and be honest.	1	1
I always try to be honest.	1	1
Good for you.	1	1
Now, try not to be overwhelmed	1	1
by all this technology.	1	1
It looks complicated,	1	1
but the men who designed it	1	1
made it simple enough for a woman to use.	1	1
I sure hope so.	1	1
At lunch, pick up a box of chocolates,	1	1
a dozen carnations, and some bath salts.	1	1
I'll explain later.	1	1
Thank you, Miss Holloway.	1	1
You're really wonderful for looking out for me this way.	1	1
It's Joan.	1	1
And listen,	1	1
don't take this the wrong way,	1	1
but a girl like you, with those darling little ankles,	1	1
I'd find a way to make 'em sing.	1	1
Also, men love scarves.	1	1
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	1	1
Oh! And Mr. Sterling. How are you?	1	1
Morning, girls.	1	1
You look like a hundred bucks. Long night?	1	1
It's not this tobacco thing, is it?	1	1
It's been on my mind.	1	1
Yeah, well, I should hope so.	1	1
Lee Garner, his father,	1	1
the whole Lucky Strike family will be here at 4.	1	1
You worried?	1	1
No.	1	1
If I was worried, I'd ask you what you've got,	1	1
but I'm not, so I'm just going to assume you've got something,	1	1
which means you should be worried.	1	1
So you came here because you wanted to watch me get dressed?	1	1
No, I wanted to make sure you were here.	1	1
In body. Give me about a half hour	1	1
for the rest of it.	1	1
Oh.	1	1
How do I put this?	1	1
Have we ever hired any Jews?	1	1
Not on my watch.	1	1
That's very funny. It's not what I meant.	1	1
We've got an Italian. Salvatore, my art director.	1	1
That won't work. Sorry.	1	1
Most of the Jewish guys work for the Jewish firms.	1	1
Yeah, I know.	1	1
Selling Jewish products to Jewish people.	1	1
That's very good.	1	1
It's just that our 11:00	1	1
is with Menken's Department Store	1	1
and I wish we had someone to make them feel...	1	1
comfortable.	1	1
You want me to run down to the deli and grab somebody?	1	1
You missed a button.	1	1
Ah. Look at you, Gidget.	1	1
Still trying to fill out that bikini?	1	1
Summer's coming.	1	1
Without the medical claims,	1	1
all we have is a white box with a red spot on it.	1	1
My neighbor posed for that.	1	1
Believe me, he always looks very relaxed.	1	1
Of course, he doesn't smoke.	1	1
Had him hold a pencil.	1	1
If I know these guys,	1	1
you're better off with a little sex appeal.	1	1
Can you give me a woman in a bathing suit,	1	1
put her next to your guy?	1	1
A sexy girl? I can do that.	1	1
Give you a chance to get a real model.	1	1
Oh, I love my work.	1	1
Speaking of sexy girls,	1	1
are you going to Pete's bachelor party?	1	1
I'm not really big on those things.	1	1
Tell me about it. It's so embarrassing.	1	1
If a girl's gonna shake it in my face,	1	1
I want to be alone so I can do something.	1	1
Should we drink before the meeting or after?	1	1
Or both?	1	1
So... that's it, huh? Relax?	1	1
Don't be short with me.	1	1
You're the writer.	1	1
I thought it was worth a try.	1	1
Greta Guttman is here to see you.	1	1
Send her in.	1	1
Oh, great.	1	1
Now we get to hear from our man in research.	1	1
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,	1	1
you both seemed more relaxed than I expected.	1	1
Do you have some kind of surprise for the tobacco people?	1	1
I'm doing my own research.	1	1
If you're planning to continue with medical testimony,	1	1
you'll only be inviting further government interference.	1	1
We must police ourselves.	1	1
There's your slogan. The medical thing is dead.	1	1
We understand that.	1	1
Yes, dead. An apt choice of words,	1	1
considering the public is convinced	1	1
that cigarettes are poisonous.	1	1
If we can't insist that they're not,	1	1
I believe my most recent surveys	1	1
have provided a solution.	1	1
We can still suggest	1	1
that cigarettes are part of American life,	1	1
or too good to give up,	1	1
or, most appealing, an assertion of independence.	1	1
So, basically, if you love danger, you'll love smoking.	1	1
We can put a skull and crossbones on the label.	1	1
I love it.	1	1
Before the war,	1	1
when I studied with Adler in Vienna,	1	1
we postulated that what Freud called the death wish	1	1
is as powerful a drive	1	1
as those for sexual reproduction	1	1
and physical sustenance.	1	1
Freud, you say?	1	1
What agency is he with?	1	1
So we're supposed to believe	1	1
that people are all living one way	1	1
and secretly thinking the exact opposite?	1	1
That's ridiculous.	1	1
Let me tell you something, Miss Guttman...	1	1
Doctor.	1	1
Dr. Guttman.	1	1
Psychology might be great at cocktail parties,	1	1
but it so happens that people were buying cigarettes	1	1
before Freud was born.	1	1
The issue here isn't why should people smoke.	1	1
It's why should people smoke Lucky Strike.	1	1
Suggesting that our customers have a...	1	1
What did you call it? A death wish?	1	1
I just don't see that on a billboard.	1	1
So what if Reader's Digest says they're dangerous?	1	1
They also said Bambi was the book of the century.	1	1
There's no proof.	1	1
There's conclusive proof	1	1
that none of these low-tar, low-nicotine,	1	1
or filtration systems	1	1
have any effect on the incidences of lung cancer.	1	1
Just give me the damn report.	1	1
I think you'll find it very convincing.	1	1
I'm sure I will.	1	1
You're the one who found	1	1
all of our medical testimonials in the first place.	1	1
That's true, Mr. Draper, but I...	1	1
Has anyone else seen this?	1	1
Of course not. It's your account.	1	1
Good.	1	1
I don't want to hear about it anymore.	1	1
I'm sorry. I just find your whole approach perverse.	1	1
Good luck at the meeting.	1	1
I'm sure it will be a quick one.	1	1
Sal, I'll take that drink now.	1	1
Mr. Draper.	1	1
Excuse me.	1	1
Mr. Draper.	1	1
I'm sorry to wake you, but Mr. Campbell is outside.	1	1
He doesn't know I'm sleeping in here, does he?	1	1
No, sir.	1	1
That's good.	1	1
Who are you?	1	1
I'm Peggy Olson, the new girl.	1	1
Can you go out there and entertain him?	1	1
I know it's my first day,	1	1
and I don't want to seem uncooperative,	1	1
but do I have to?	1	1
I see your point.	1	1
I brought you some aspirin.	1	1
Send him in.	1	1
You look like a hundred bucks.	1	1
Ready to go sweet-talk some retail Jews?	1	1
You are tough to take first thing in the morning, Pete.	1	1
I've never had any complaints.	1	1
Speaking of which, who's your little friend here?	1	1
She's the new girl.	1	1
You always get the new girl.	1	1
Management gets all the perks.	1	1
Where are you from, honey?	1	1
Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.	1	1
Top notch.	1	1
But I meant where are you from?	1	1
Are you Amish or something?	1	1
No. I'm from Brooklyn.	1	1
Well, you're in the city now.	1	1
It wouldn't be a sin for us to see your legs.	1	1
If you pull your waist in, you might look like a woman.	1	1
Is that all, Mr. Draper?	1	1
Hey, I'm not done here.	1	1
I'm working my way up.	1	1
That will be all.	1	1
Peggy, right? Yes.	1	1
Oh, and it's time for your 11:00 meeting.	1	1
Oh, and sorry about Mr. Campbell here.	1	1
He left his manners back at the fraternity house.	1	1
She's a little young for you, Draper.	1	1
The future Mrs. Pete Campbell is a very lucky woman.	1	1
When's the wedding again?	1	1
Sunday. Did Ken tell you	1	1
about the bachelor party tonight?	1	1
He sure did.	1	1
So do I get first crack at her?	1	1
Word is she took down more sailors than The Arizona.	1	1
How old are you, Pete?	1	1
I just turned 26.	1	1
I bet the whole world looks like	1	1
one great big brassiere strap	1	1
just waiting to be snapped, huh?	1	1
You are good with words, Draper.	1	1
Campbell, we're both men here,	1	1
so I'm gonna be direct.	1	1
Christ, are you already sleeping with her?	1	1
Advertising is a very small world,	1	1
and when you do something like malign the reputation	1	1
of a girl from the steno pool on her first day,	1	1
you make it even smaller.	1	1
Keep it up, and even if you do get my job,	1	1
you'll never run this place.	1	1
You'll die in that corner office,	1	1
a mid-level executive with a little bit of hair	1	1
who women go home with out of pity.	1	1
Want to know why?	1	1
'Cause no one will like you.	1	1
Oh! Here are our miracle-workers now.	1	1
You know Pete Campbell, of course,	1	1
your account executive if you choose to do business with us.	1	1
And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,	1	1
the best creative director in New York.	1	1
Well, at least the building. Pleasure to meet you.	1	1
Oop. Sorry about that.	1	1
I'm Rachel Menken.	1	1
Oh. Uh, sorry. I was expecting...	1	1
You were expecting me to be a man.	1	1
My father was, too.	1	1
And you are?	1	1
Why, Don, you remember David Cohen	1	1
from the art department.	1	1
Of course! David.	1	1
One of the rising stars here at Sterling Cooper.	1	1
Well, why don't we make ourselves comfortable?	1	1
And Miss Menken, you can tell us what you have in mind.	1	1
Wonderful.	1	1
That's very subtle.	1	1
Isn't that your shirt?	1	1
Had to go all the way to the mailroom,	1	1
but I found one.	1	1
So you must be Peggy Olson.	1	1
Joan Holloway sent you over.	1	1
She's a great girl. How is Joan?	1	1
She sends her regards.	1	1
She's a lot of fun.	1	1
Must be a scream to work with her.	1	1
Yes, it's pretty terrific.	1	1
Mm-hmm.	1	1
Try to make yourself comfortable.	1	1
Relax.	1	1
I see from your chart, and your finger,	1	1
that you're not married.	1	1
That's right.	1	1
And yet you're interested in the contraceptive pills.	1	1
Well, I was...	1	1
No reason to be nervous.	1	1
Joan sent you to me because I'm not here to judge you.	1	1
There's nothing wrong with a woman being practical	1	1
about the possibility of sexual activity.	1	1
Spread your knees.	1	1
That's good to hear.	1	1
Although, as a doctor,	1	1
I'd like to think that putting a woman in this situation	1	1
is not gonna turn her into some kind of strumpet.	1	1
Slide your fanny toward me. I'm not gonna bite.	1	1
I'll warn you now,	1	1
I will take you off this medicine if you abuse it.	1	1
It's for your own good, really.	1	1
But the fact is, even in our modern times,	1	1
easy women...	1	1
don't find husbands.	1	1
I understand, Dr. Emerson.	1	1
I really am a very responsible person.	1	1
Well, I'm sure you're not that kind of girl.	1	1
Now, Joan...	1	1
I'm just kidding along here. You can get dressed.	1	1
I'm gonna write you a prescription for Enovid.	1	1
They're $11 a month,	1	1
but don't think you have to go out	1	1
and become the town pump	1	1
just to get your money's worth.	1	1
Excuse my French.	1	1
So what Don is saying	1	1
is that through a variety of media,	1	1
including a spot during The Danny Thomas Show,	1	1
if you can afford it,	1	1
we could really boost awareness.	1	1
Then, a 10% off coupon in select ladies' magazines	1	1
will increase your first-time visitors.	1	1
Once we get them into the store,	1	1
the rest...	1	1
is kind of up to you.	1	1
Mr. Draper, our store is 60 years old.	1	1
We share a wall with Tiffany's.	1	1
Honestly, a coupon?	1	1
Miss Menken, coupons work.	1	1
I think your father would agree with the strategy.	1	1
He might, but he's not here	1	1
because we just had our lowest sales year ever.	1	1
So I suppose what I think	1	1
matters most right now.	1	1
Miss Menken, why did you come here?	1	1
There are a dozen other agencies	1	1
better suited to your... needs.	1	1
If I wanted some man who happened to be	1	1
from the same... village as my father	1	1
to manage my account,	1	1
I could have stayed where I was.	1	1
Their research favors coupons, too.	1	1
It's not just research, Miss Menken.	1	1
Housewives love coupons.	1	1
I'm not interested in housewives.	1	1
What kind of people do you want?	1	1
I want your kind of people, Mr. Draper:	1	1
people who don't care about coupons,	1	1
whether or not they can afford it.	1	1
People who are coming to the store	1	1
because it is expensive.	1	1
We obviously have very different ideas.	1	1
Yes, like the customer is always right?	1	1
Gentlemen, I really thought	1	1
you could do better than this.	1	1
Sterling Cooper has a reputation for being innovative.	1	1
Miss, you are way out of line.	1	1
Don, please.	1	1
Let's not get emotional here.	1	1
There's no reason we can't talk this out.	1	1
Talk out what? This silly idea	1	1
that people are gonna come to some store they've never been to	1	1
because it's more expensive?	1	1
It works for Chanel.	1	1
Menken's is not Chanel.	1	1
That's a vote of confidence.	1	1
What Don's saying is,	1	1
Chanel is a very different kind of place.	1	1
It's French, it's continental, it's...	1	1
Not just another Jewish department store?	1	1
Exactly.	1	1
You were right, Roger.	1	1
This place really runs on charm.	1	1
This is ridiculous. Don.	1	1
I'm not gonna let a woman talk to me like this.	1	1
This meeting is over. Good luck, Miss Menken.	1	1
Hey, Don, I don't blame you.	1	1
She was way out of line.	1	1
Adding money and education	1	1
doesn't take the rude edge out of people.	1	1
Roger's not gonna be happy,	1	1
so I guess that's good for you.	1	1
I'm not gonna pretend I don't want your job,	1	1
but you were right.	1	1
I'm not great with people,	1	1
and you are.	1	1
I mean, not counting that meeting we were just in.	1	1
So I'm kind of counting on you to help me out.	1	1
There's plenty of room at the top.	1	1
Look, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before.	1	1
It's just this damn tobacco thing.	1	1
You'll think of something. A man like you	1	1
I'd follow into combat blindfolded,	1	1
and I wouldn't be the first.	1	1
Am I right, buddy?	1	1
Let's take it a little slower.	1	1
I don't want to wake up pregnant.	1	1
Fuck you.	1	1
Dr. Emerson's a dream, isn't he?	1	1
He seemed nice.	1	1
He has a place in South Hampton.	1	1
I'm not saying that I've seen it,	1	1
but it's beautiful.	1	1
Now, don't be nervous,	1	1
but this is the nerve center of the office.	1	1
You and your boss rely on the willing	1	1
and cheerful cooperation	1	1
of a few skilled employees.	1	1
Never snap, yell,	1	1
or be sarcastic with them.	1	1
And above all,	1	1
always be a supplicant.	1	1
I know you girls are busy, but we've got a new one.	1	1
Peggy, this is Marge, Nanette, and Ivy.	1	1
I brought you some things.	1	1
"I guess a sort of ""getting to know you"" gift."	1	1
Well, aren't you a sweetheart?	1	1
If I know Joan, the candy's for me.	1	1
Joan, you're not fair.	1	1
You know she has to lose eight pounds	1	1
by the Christmas party.	1	1
I think you look great.	1	1
Yeah, it's because I'm sitting down.	1	1
You can come back and visit any time you want, honey.	1	1
Who does she work for?	1	1
Don Draper.	1	1
They got rid of Eleanor?	1	1
She moved on.	1	1
Draper wasn't interested.	1	1
Well, she couldn't get a call through.	1	1
Rude little thing.	1	1
We see that you've got your hands full.	1	1
Don't want to be a bother.	1	1
Nice meeting you.	1	1
Hey, you have great legs.	1	1
I bet you Mr. Draper would like them	1	1
if he could see them.	1	1
Sterling Cooper.	1	1
How may I direct your call?	1	1
I just don't know what we have to do	1	1
to make these government interlopers happy.	1	1
They tell us to make a safer cigarette,	1	1
we do it,	1	1
and then suddenly that's not good enough.	1	1
Might as well be living in Russia.	1	1
Mmm. Damn straight.	1	1
You know, this morning I got a call	1	1
from my competitors at Brown & Williamson,	1	1
and they're getting sued by the federal government	1	1
because of the health claims they made.	1	1
Yeah, we're aware of that, Mr. Garner,	1	1
but you have to realize	1	1
that through the manipulation of the mass media,	1	1
the public is under the impression	1	1
that your cigarettes are linked to...	1	1
certain fatal diseases.	1	1
Manipulation of the media?	1	1
Hell, that's what I pay you for.	1	1
Our product is fine. I smoke 'em myself.	1	1
My granddad smoked 'em. He died at 95 years old.	1	1
He was hit by a truck.	1	1
I understand. But our hands are tied.	1	1
We're no longer allowed to advertise	1	1
that Lucky Strikes are safe.	1	1
So what the hell are we gonna do?	1	1
We've already funded our own tobacco research center	1	1
to put this whole rumor to rest.	1	1
And that's a very good start.	1	1
But it may not affect sales.	1	1
Don, I think maybe that's your cue.	1	1
Well, uh...	1	1
I have been, uh...	1	1
thinking quite a bit about this,	1	1
and, uh...	1	1
I mean, you know I'm a Lucky Strike man from way back, so...	1	1
I might have a solution.	1	1
At Sterling Cooper,	1	1
we've been pioneering the burgeoning field of research,	1	1
and our analysis shows	1	1
that the health risks associated with your product	1	1
is not the end of the world.	1	1
People get in their cars every day to go to work,	1	1
and some of them die.	1	1
Cars are dangerous.	1	1
There's nothing you can do about it.	1	1
You still have to get where you're going.	1	1
Cigarettes are exactly the same,	1	1
so why don't we simply say,	1	1
"""So what if cigarettes are dangerous?"	1	1
"""You're a man."	1	1
"""The world is dangerous."	1	1
"""Smoke your cigarette."	1	1
"You still have to get where you're going."""	1	1
That's very interesting.	1	1
I mean, if cigarettes were dangerous,	1	1
it would be interesting.	1	1
Except they aren't.	1	1
That's your slogan?	1	1
"""You're going to die anyway. Die with us""?"	1	1
Actually, it's a fairly well-established psychological principle	1	1
that society has a death wish,	1	1
and if we could just tap into that,	1	1
the market potential is...	1	1
What the hell are you talking about?	1	1
Are you insane?	1	1
I'm not selling rifles here.	1	1
I'm in the tobacco business.	1	1
We're selling America.	1	1
The Indians gave it to us, for shit's sake.	1	1
Come on, Dad.	1	1
Let's get out of here.	1	1
The bright spot is, at least we know	1	1
if we have this problem,	1	1
everybody has this problem.	1	1
Gentlemen, before you leave, can I just say something?	1	1
I don't know, Don. Can you?	1	1
The Federal Trade Commission and Reader's Digest	1	1
have done you a favor.	1	1
They've let you know that any ad that brings up	1	1
the concept of cigarettes and health together...	1	1
Well, it's just gonna make people think of cancer.	1	1
Yes, and we're grateful to them.	1	1
But what Lee, Jr., said is right.	1	1
If you can't make those health claims,	1	1
neither can your competitors.	1	1
So we've got a lot of people	1	1
not saying anything that sells cigarettes.	1	1
Not exactly.	1	1
This is the greatest advertising opportunity	1	1
since the invention of cereal.	1	1
We have six identical companies	1	1
making six identical products.	1	1
We can say anything we want.	1	1
How do you make your cigarettes?	1	1
I don't know.	1	1
Shame on you.	1	1
We breed insect-repellent tobacco seeds,	1	1
plant them in the North Carolina sunshine,	1	1
grow it, cut it, cure it, toast it...	1	1
There you go.	1	1
There you go.	1	1
But everybody else's tobacco is toasted.	1	1
No. Everybody else's tobacco is poisonous.	1	1
Lucky Strikes...	1	1
is toasted.	1	1
Well, gentlemen, I don't think I have to tell you what you just witnessed here.	1	1
I think you do.	1	1
Advertising is based on one thing:	1	1
happiness.	1	1
And you know what happiness is?	1	1
Happiness is the smell of a new car.	1	1
It's freedom from fear.	1	1
It's a billboard on the side of the road	1	1
that screams with reassurance	1	1
that whatever you're doing...	1	1
it's okay.	1	1
You are okay.	1	1
It's toasted.	1	1
I get it.	1	1
You had me worried.	1	1
I don't know if you were drunk or not drunk,	1	1
but that was inspired.	1	1
For the record, I pulled it out of thin air,	1	1
so thank you, up there.	1	1
You're looking in the wrong direction.	1	1
So now that I've got you in the afterglow here,	1	1
what do you say you reconsider this presidential campaign?	1	1
I don't know. Bunting and babies?	1	1
That's hard work.	1	1
I'd only make hash of it.	1	1
Modesty. That's adorable.	1	1
Consider the product: he's young, handsome, Navy hero.	1	1
Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult	1	1
to convince America Dick Nixon is a winner.	1	1
Mr. Draper, you've got visitors.	1	1
Could you be a little more specific, honey?	1	1
We heard you saved the day.	1	1
Oh, thank you, boys. I appreciate it.	1	1
I told them how amazing you were.	1	1
I'm still tingling.	1	1
Well, looks like you're all going to engage	1	1
in a little mid-level camaraderie,	1	1
so I'll be on my way.	1	1
Don, thanks again for the home run.	1	1
I love to come through. Speaking of which,	1	1
any chance you could patch things up with Rachel Menken?	1	1
Any way you can be as charming as I said you were?	1	1
Haven't you had enough of my magic for one day?	1	1
She's worth $3 million.	1	1
You're a whore.	1	1
Peggy...	1	1
Could she get us a little more ice?	1	1
Yes, Mr. Draper? Just a minute.	1	1
Fellas, I think this party's gonna have to move elsewhere.	1	1
We'll move wherever you want, but it's 5:15.	1	1
The bachelor party's underway.	1	1
I don't know.	1	1
Oh, come on, Don. All hands on deck.	1	1
Aren't you gonna help give Pete his big sendoff?	1	1
Maybe next time.	1	1
Come on, guys.	1	1
Don will join us later, right, Don?	1	1
If Greta's research was any good,	1	1
I would have used it.	1	1
What are you talking about?	1	1
I'm saying I had a report just like that.	1	1
And it's not like there's some magic machine	1	1
that makes identical copies of things.	1	1
I still think she was right.	1	1
Have a great night, Pete.	1	1
Congratulations.	1	1
I heard you were amazing in the meeting.	1	1
Fear stimulates my imagination.	1	1
I just wanted to thank you for a great first day,	1	1
and for, you know...	1	1
standing up for me with Mr. Campbell.	1	1
First of all, Peggy,	1	1
I'm your boss, not your boyfriend.	1	1
Second of all, you ever let Pete Campbell go through my trash again,	1	1
and you won't be able to find a job selling sandwiches in Penn Station.	1	1
He said he left his fountain pen in here.	1	1
I didn't know.	1	1
I hope you don't think I'm that kind of girl.	1	1
Of course not.	1	1
Go home. Put your curlers in.	1	1
We'll get a fresh start tomorrow.	1	1
Oh. And, Peggy,	1	1
I need you to place a call.	1	1
♪♪	1	1
I want to see you here every 15 minutes,	1	1
whether you have drinks or not.	1	1
Uh, every five minutes.	1	1
Let's live here.	1	1
Better do more than look tonight.	1	1
Do you have a girlfriend, Salvatore?	1	1
Come on. I'm Italian.	1	1
Is there some kind of party here?	1	1
How did you swing it?	1	1
They work at the Automat.	1	1
He pressed a button, and they came out.	1	1
I hope we're not interrupting anything.	1	1
Definitely not.	1	1
Well, I have the best seat. What are we drinking?	1	1
More of whatever's making you the way you are.	1	1
I love this place.	1	1
It's hot, loud, and filled with men.	1	1
I know what you mean.	1	1
Oh, my God. I can already feel it.	1	1
I have a feeling you're like this all the time.	1	1
I like to laugh.	1	1
Is that right?	1	1
Now, you stop that.	1	1
You said you like to laugh.	1	1
I mean it.	1	1
It's... It's too...	1	1
Too delicious.	1	1
Hey, I said stop it. What do you think you're doing?	1	1
You know exactly.	1	1
Um, you know what, girls?	1	1
I think we should go.	1	1
Oh, come on.	1	1
You're hurting me.	1	1
I'll be good.	1	1
Buy the girls whatever they want.	1	1
So, uh, what do you fellas do?	1	1
You're looking at the finest ad men in New York.	1	1
Hell, the world.	1	1
♪♪	1	1
For the lady, a special Mai Tai,	1	1
and one whiskey neat.	1	1
So...	1	1
you're going to ply me with drinks	1	1
and convince me what a terrible mistake I'm making.	1	1
That is quite a drink.	1	1
You got in trouble, didn't you?	1	1
I shouldn't have lost my temper,	1	1
and I certainly shouldn't have treated you	1	1
like anything less than a client.	1	1
Apology accepted.	1	1
So you understand.	1	1
Now I do.	1	1
It was, uh, refreshing, really.	1	1
I mean, actually hearing all the things	1	1
I always assumed people were thinking.	1	1
Well, I'm not really as bad as all that.	1	1
I was under a lot of pressure.	1	1
Another account.	1	1
Doesn't really matter.	1	1
No, it doesn't.	1	1
So, without making things worse,	1	1
can I ask you a personal question?	1	1
Don't you want to get	1	1
a second drink in me first?	1	1
Why aren't you married?	1	1
Are you asking what's wrong with me?	1	1
It's just that you're a beautiful, educated woman.	1	1
Don't you think that getting married and having a family	1	1
would make you happier than all the headaches	1	1
that go along with...	1	1
fighting people like me?	1	1
If I weren't a woman, I would be allowed	1	1
to ask you the same question.	1	1
And if I weren't a woman,	1	1
I wouldn't have to choose	1	1
between putting on an apron	1	1
and the thrill of making my father's store	1	1
what I always thought it should be.	1	1
So that's it. You won't get married	1	1
because you find business to be a thrill.	1	1
That and...	1	1
I've never been in love.	1	1
She won't get married because she's never been in love.	1	1
I think I wrote that once to sell nylons.	1	1
For a lot of people, love isn't just a slogan.	1	1
Oh, you mean love.	1	1
You mean the big lightning bolt to the heart	1	1
where you can't eat and you can't work	1	1
and you just run off	1	1
and get married and make babies.	1	1
The reason you haven't felt it	1	1
is because it doesn't exist.	1	1
What you call love	1	1
was invented by guys like me to sell nylons.	1	1
Is that right?	1	1
I'm pretty sure about it.	1	1
You're born alone, and you die alone,	1	1
and this world just drops a bunch of rules on you	1	1
to make you forget those facts,	1	1
but I never forget.	1	1
I'm living like there's no tomorrow...	1	1
because there isn't one.	1	1
I don't think I realized it	1	1
until this moment,	1	1
but it must be hard being a man, too.	1	1
Excuse me?	1	1
Mr. Draper...	1	1
Don. Mr. Draper,	1	1
I don't know what it is you really believe in,	1	1
but I do know what it feels like	1	1
to be out of place,	1	1
to be disconnected,	1	1
to see the whole world laid out in front of you	1	1
the way other people live it.	1	1
There is something about you	1	1
that tells me you know it, too.	1	1
I don't know if that's true.	1	1
You want another drink?	1	1
No.	1	1
But you can tell your boss that you charmed me.	1	1
So I guess we'll be seeing each other again.	1	1
I'll be back in the office Monday morning,	1	1
for a real meeting.	1	1
I'd like that.	1	1
We're not buying anything.	1	1
Actually, for the first time today,	1	1
I'm not selling anything.	1	1
Does Peggy live here?	1	1
Hold on.	1	1
Do you know him?	1	1
It's okay, Marjorie. We work together.	1	1
He's really drunk.	1	1
It's okay, Marjorie.	1	1
So...	1	1
what are you doing?	1	1
Nothing.	1	1
Just, uh, sitting in my room listening to records.	1	1
I'm getting married on Sunday.	1	1
I heard that.	1	1
You must think I'm a creep.	1	1
Why are you here?	1	1
I wanted to see you tonight.	1	1
Me?	1	1
I had to see you.	1	1
Marjorie?	1	1
Yeah, Peg?	1	1
I'm going to bed now.	1	1
I called the office. They said you'd left.	1	1
I didn't want to bother you.	1	1
It's no bother.	1	1
I just assumed you were staying in the city again.	1	1
There's a plate in the oven.	1	1
Unless you're not hungry.	1	1
I'm not.	1	1

Another egg.	1	2
Well, I am having fried chicken.	1	2
As long as the egg comes first.	1	2
My nanny, Belva, made fried chicken.	1	2
I used to take it to school wrapped in wax paper.	1	2
His sweet Belvedere. Hmm.	1	2
He really loved that woman.	1	2
 Had another nanny originally. German girl.	1	2
Round face, enormous bosom.	1	2
My parents got rid of her after the Lindbergh baby.	1	2
We thought about getting a nanny.	1	2
We have a girl that comes in,	1	2
who's sort of a housekeeper	1	2
and sometimes babysitter.	1	2
I'd let her take the children to play group,	1	2
sometimes the park.	1	2
Belva raised me.	1	2
I turned out just fine.	1	2
Didn't have to go to a psychiatrist	1	2

Margaret is practically the last girl	1	2
in our building to go.	1	2
16 years old, wouldn't get out of bed.	1	2
I tell you, I cannot wait	1	2

What about you, Don?	1	2
Did you have a nanny?	1	2
I can't tell you about my childhood.	1	2
It would ruin the first half of my novel.	1	2
Don doesn't like to talk about himself.	1	2
I know better than to ask.	1	2

So whether Dick Nixon likes it or not...	1	2
We will give our people	1	2
what they want, agreed?	1	2
I said cut it out!	1	2
Be my pleasure.	1	2
Goodie.	1	2
Assemble a team.	1	2
Start files on contenders:	1	2
Symington, Kennedy...	1	2
Who knows? Maybe Eleanor Roosevelt	1	2
will throw her feedbag into the ring.	1	2
Don, you still on for lunch?	1	2
No.	1	2
Don't tell me that's lunch.	1	2
I've got a lot of work to catch up on.	1	2
I do that sometimes.	1	2
Saunter over to the pie cart.	1	2
Egg salad and the worst cup of coffee in the world.	1	2
35 cents.	1	2
I've been meaning to try it.	1	2
It's okay if you like ptomaine poisoning.	1	2
Well, toodle-oo.	1	2
Secretary 1, copywriter 0.	1	2
It wasn't that.	1	2
I bring my lunch	1	2
at least until after the first of the month.	1	2
Get your things.	1	2
That sandwich is making me sad.	1	2
It's a postcard from Campbell on his honeymoon.	1	2
Niagara Falls.	1	2
"""Greetings from the wettest place on earth."""	1	2
I say we skip lunch altogether	1	2
and try on those narrow sweater sets	1	2
I saw at Lord and Taylor.	1	2
Do you want me to sit outside the dressing room	1	2
and hold your purse?	1	2
What he's trying to say is,	1	2
can we buy you lunch?	1	2
Oh. I don't know.	1	2
We hadn't planned on eating.	1	2
Come on, three on two.	1	2
I know you all like being outnumbered.	1	2
That's two on two. I'm married.	1	2
You still have to eat lunch.	1	2
What do you say? Change of plans?	1	2
They do smell nice.	1	2
What's that?	1	2
Postcard from Pete Campbell.	1	2
He's on a honeymoon, right?	1	2
Niagara Falls.	1	2
He hasn't, uh, left the room, apparently.	1	2
Shall we?	1	2
So, Pegs, you part of our nation's military industrial	1	2
boyfriend-girlfriend complex?	1	2
Excuse me?	1	2
He wants to know are you, uh, taken,	1	2
are you kept, or merely browsing?	1	2
She browsing.	1	2
And like most of us,	1	2
she's disappointed with the selection of merchandise.	1	2
Perhaps I can interest you in a 42 long?	1	2
That's not his suit size.	1	2
She blushes.	1	2
No, I don't.	1	2
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this,	1	2
but, uh, you are the subject of much debate.	1	2
Money riding on the outcome.	1	2
Money for me?	1	2
Now there's even a third possibility:	1	2
paying you.	1	2
We should be getting back.	1	2
I'll get the check.	1	2
My goodness. Thank you for lunch, boys.	1	2
Yes. Thank you.	1	2
Take the rest of the afternoon off.	1	2
We could... go to the zoo,	1	2
see what the animals are up to.	1	2
Um...	1	2
I should get back to work.	1	2
Or shopping.	1	2
Guess I don't see any money changing hands, Kenny.	1	2
You'll see.	1	2
My persistence is my charm.	1	2
That was delicious.	1	2
You enjoy yourself with the Hitler Youth?	1	2
Oh. Well, it was kind of last-minute.	1	2
Easy. See that Draper takes a look at this.	1	2
Certainly.	1	2
You can look, too.	1	2
Three of the last PTA presidents	1	2
are from the kindergarten class.	1	2
I say you go in there and lay some groundwork.	1	2
I will not have Marilyn Kechner dictate the agenda.	1	2
The woman is obsessed with nutrition,	1	2
although you wouldn't know it to look at her.	1	2
Francine, you're terrible.	1	2
Ooh. I ran into Juanita Cabot at square dancing,	1	2
and I found out who's moving	1	2
into that little Dutch Colonial down the street.	1	2
Who?	1	2
Her name is Helen Bishop.	1	2
Is she an old lady?	1	2
Divorced.	1	2
Really?	1	2
9-year-old boy and a baby.	1	2
That's awful.	1	2
I know.	1	2
All on her own?	1	2
I know.	1	2
Can you imagine worrying about money	1	2
at this point in our lives?	1	2
Well, obviously, that's not the worst of it.	1	2
No.	1	2
No, it isn't.	1	2
It is too quiet in there.	1	2
Ernie?	1	2
Sally?	1	2
We're playing spaceman.	1	2
Sally Draper, come over here this minute.	1	2
If the clothes from that dry cleaning bag	1	2
are on the floor of my closet,	1	2
you're going to be a very sorry young lady.	1	2
Make sure your brother hasn't climbed	1	2
out of the play yard.	1	2
Juanita thinks it might be bad	1	2
for real estate values in Chilmark.	1	2
One divorcée?	1	2
Bobby!	1	2
Rowm!	1	2
Oh, my God.	1	2
Are you okay?	1	2
Oh.	1	2
What's that?	1	2
What?	1	2
That.	1	2
That's a television.	1	2
Since when do you have a television?	1	2
I don't know. I think it's been about ten days.	1	2
It's been so amazing, I sort of lost track.	1	2
I seem to remember a woman	1	2
wasting a good piece of a beautiful afternoon	1	2
reciting this diatribe against television	1	2
that should have ended	1	2
with her banging her shoe on the table.	1	2
Don, darling, if you want to ask the question,	1	2
just ask it.	1	2
Where'd you get the TV?	1	2
I got it.	1	2
Same place you got that wig?	1	2
Someone gave it to me.	1	2
And you took it?	1	2
Have you seen this thing called People Are Funny?	1	2
Jesus.	1	2
Oh, Jesus, Don.	1	2
Hey!	1	2
All better?	1	2
Yes.	1	2
How about a hot dog?	1	2
Sit at your places. Come on.	1	2
Daddy!	1	2
We went to the hospital.	1	2
We got lollipops.	1	2
They're fine, Don.	1	2
What about you?	1	2
A little sore.	1	2
A little embarrassed.	1	2
Sorry they couldn't get a hold of me.	1	2
We had to carry Freddie Rumson out of Ritazzi's.	1	2
There was nothing you could have done.	1	2
Daddy, use a fork.	1	2
How's the car?	1	2
Not bad.	1	2
Uh, thank God I was only going 25 tops.	1	2
I hate the way you drive, you know.	1	2
I'm finished.	1	2
Can I go watch Shirley Temple's Storybook?	1	2
Yes, both of you.	1	2
So what happened?	1	2
I don't know, really.	1	2
It... It all happened so fast.	1	2
What, 20 miles an hour?	1	2
That's not that fast.	1	2
It's stupid.	1	2
Was it Sally playing with the radio again?	1	2
I've warned her. No, she was fine.	1	2
She was just sitting there. No.	1	2
It was my hands. It happened again.	1	2
Jesus.	1	2
Betty, you have to get this taken care of.	1	2
That Dr. Patterson is not thorough.	1	2
I swear, when we walked down Park Avenue,	1	2
I could hear the quacking.	1	2
I know. You've said that.	1	2
This doctor was nice.	1	2
He was older, actually.	1	2
He's from Rochester.	1	2
He has two children. They're 10 years apart.	1	2
Okay, you've given me his credentials.	1	2
What did he say?	1	2
Well, he said I could go to New York and run the dye tests,	1	2
and I said that I already had	1	2
and that the results were negative,	1	2
and he even called Dr. Patterson.	1	2
So?	1	2
They said there was nothing physically wrong with me.	1	2
Then I t-told him what happened,	1	2
and he said that I should see a psychiatrist.	1	2
Doctors must love	1	2
that they now have an answer	1	2
"for ""I don't know what's wrong."""	1	2
He said it could be a nervous condition.	1	2
Nervous about what, driving?	1	2
So we'll go down to the Grand Union parking lot.	1	2
We'll practice your 10 and 2.	1	2
He seemed very concerned, if you want to know.	1	2
But that's their solution.	1	2
Why not open the hood and poke around?	1	2
So?	1	2
So... I left.	1	2
What else am I supposed to do?	1	2
Well, go to a doctor...	1	2
Another doctor, a good one.	1	2
I'll get a specialist from Bert Cooper.	1	2
His name's on a wall over at St. Vincent's.	1	2
Okay.	1	2
Leave the dishes for the girl.	1	2
7, 8, 9,	1	2
10, 11, 12...	1	2
98, 99, 100.	1	2
You know, I do worry about you, birdie.	1	2
I know.	1	2
When he brought it up, I was shocked.	1	2
Although, I realize that that's what Dr. Patterson	1	2
was trying to say in his own way, and...	1	2
It doesn't have... as much of a stigma today.	1	2
I just don't know what they can possibly tell you.	1	2
Do you think I need a psychiatrist?	1	2
I always thought people saw a psychiatrist	1	2
when they were unhappy.	1	2
But I look at you...	1	2
and this...	1	2
and them...	1	2
and that...	1	2
"and I think, ""Are you unhappy?"""	1	2
Of course I'm happy.	1	2
Well, that'll be $35. You're welcome.	1	2
Whatever you think is best.	1	2
Good.	1	2
Act of God. Sorry.	1	2
Someone threw themselves in front of the train.	1	2
Ah, suicide.	1	2
Okay, boys, what do we have?	1	2
Gentlemen,	1	2
the aerosol can	1	2
is nothing less than space-age.	1	2
It's steel. It has exhaust.	1	2
It's even shaped like a rocket.	1	2
Certainly an engineering marvel.	1	2
"""Right Guard:"	1	2
"it works in my suit or yours."""	1	2
We'll punch the yellow of the moon	1	2
so it pops behind him.	1	2
We're looking for new worlds,	1	2
and with that search comes any number of gadgets.	1	2
It's not just some random association.	1	2
This thing is shiny. It's explosive.	1	2
It's from the future, a place so close to us now,	1	2
filled with wonder and ease.	1	2
Except some people think of the future and it upsets them.	1	2
They see a rocket,	1	2
they start building a bomb shelter.	1	2
What? How do you get there?	1	2
I don't think it's ridiculous to assume	1	2
we're looking for other planets	1	2
because this one will end.	1	2
I thought we had something here.	1	2
Who is this moron flying around space?	1	2
I mean, he pees in his pants.	1	2
Brass tacks, who buys this?	1	2
Some woman.	1	2
Your girl or your mother will pick this up	1	2
walking through the grocery store or the druggist's.	1	2
We should be asking ourselves,	1	2
"""What do women want?"""	1	2
I don't know, but I wish I had it.	1	2
Maybe a chesty alien girl	1	2
also wants to get into his suit.	1	2
"I'm not asking ""what do women want"""	1	2
in some bullshit research psychology way.	1	2
I'm asking, what would make a woman	1	2
"look at this man's deodorant and say ""I want that""?"	1	2
Well, I've stopped trying to figure out what they think.	1	2
Maybe I should stop paying you.	1	2
Well, I always thought women like the way we smell.	1	2
That explains a lot.	1	2
I feel like we're close here.	1	2
I mean, this one...	1	2
The can's right side up, but the guy's upside-down.	1	2
No. Let's bring it down to Earth.	1	2
You think they want a cowboy?	1	2
He's quiet and strong.	1	2
He always brings the cattle home safe.	1	2
You watch TV.	1	2
What if they want something else?	1	2
Inside, some...	1	2
mysterious wish that we're ignoring.	1	2
How'd it go?	1	2
I've still got my novel.	1	2
I'm sorry.	1	2
Buy me lunch?	1	2
Samuel, that drape, man?	1	2
It's sadder than a map.	1	2
Well, it's lightweight	1	2
and it tells me I'm at work.	1	2
But you sure can talk, Mr. Kinsey.	1	2
60 cents. Mm-hmm.	1	2
What are you doing? Keep the change.	1	2
You figured the place out yet?	1	2
What do you mean?	1	2
How it runs.	1	2
I know the copywriters	1	2
tell the Art Department what to do,	1	2
and I know the account executives	1	2
tell the copywriters what to do.	1	2
What?	1	2
No one tells the writers what to do	1	2
except for the head of Creative,	1	2
your boss, Donald Draper.	1	2
Don't think that just because he's good-looking	1	2
he's not a writer.	1	2
Dig.	1	2
This is the Media Department.	1	2
They're where 90% of where the client's check goes.	1	2
They buy space... newspapers, billboards, television,	1	2
and my favorite aging whore, radio.	1	2
That's the whole shakedown, actually.	1	2
All you really need to know.	1	2
They don't sell ideas or campaigns or jingles.	1	2
They sell media at a 15% markup.	1	2
Creative is just window dressing	1	2
that's thrown in for free.	1	2
Really?	1	2
Accounting, they keep track of how much we're spending	1	2
versus how much we're taking in,	1	2
and since we're buying futures,	1	2
if you ever, ever see, um,	1	2
the man upstairs go in there,	1	2
grab the lifeboats, baby.	1	2
We're going down.	1	2
Account Management,	1	2
where prep-schoolers skip arm-in-arm,	1	2
Wizard of Oz style,	1	2
joined together by their lack of skill	1	2
and their love of mirrors.	1	2
Account executives are all good at something,	1	2
although it's never advertising.	1	2
Submitted for your approval:	1	2
one Peter Campbell,	1	2
a man who recently discovered	1	2
that the only place for his hand	1	2
is in your pocket.	1	2
You watch it?	1	2
Have you seen it? The Twilight Zone?	1	2
I don't think so.	1	2
I don't like science fiction.	1	2
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.	1	2
Mitch in Media says CBS might pull the plug.	1	2
I'll kill myself.	1	2
And here we have the Creative Department,	1	2
the talent, home sweet home.	1	2
Like the Art Department downstairs,	1	2
they put us far enough away from the elevators	1	2
so we can't sneak out.	1	2
You know,	1	2
there are women copywriters.	1	2
Good ones? Sure.	1	2
I mean, y-you can always tell when a woman's writing copy,	1	2
but sometimes she just might be	1	2
the right man for the job, you know?	1	2
You must be very creatively satisfied.	1	2
Let's not lose our heads.	1	2
Sterling-Coop is positively Cro-Magnon.	1	2
I have a friend... I'm not even going to say what agency...	1	2
But all they do is smoke Mary Jane and play darts,	1	2
and honestly, I think they're the best store on the street.	1	2
You like Ukrainian food?	1	2
Oxtail dumplings?	1	2
I still have a lot of work to do.	1	2
I think he's still in there.	1	2
Huh. Got it.	1	2
Thanks for lunch. Sorry about your copy.	1	2
Thanks for reminding me.	1	2
Can never get used to the fact that most of the time	1	2
it looks like you're doing nothing.	1	2
Fix you something?	1	2
4:30. Close enough.	1	2
Coop is gonna want a carve-in	1	2
with your handpicked team for Nixon on it,	1	2
and I warn you right now,	1	2
it includes Pete Campbell.	1	2
I should go to Niagara Falls for two weeks.	1	2
Does wonders for your career.	1	2
Niagara Falls.	1	2
Boy redefines lack of imagination.	1	2
Ah. That's where you've been.	1	2
Let me ask you something.	1	2
What do women want?	1	2
Who cares?	1	2
You mentioned the other night	1	2
that your daughter had been to a psychiatrist.	1	2
I'm sure you must be mistaken about that.	1	2
You know what?	1	2
I am very comfortable with my mind:	1	2
thoughts clean and unclean,	1	2
loving and... the opposite of that.	1	2
But I'm not a woman.	1	2
And I think it behooves any man	1	2
to toss all female troubles	1	2
into the hands of a stranger.	1	2
We had one headshrinker in the army.	1	2
A gossip, busting with other people's thoughts.	1	2
Hasn't changed much, just costs more.	1	2
And you can't shoot at them.	1	2
We live in troubling times.	1	2
We do?	1	2
Who could not be happy with all this?	1	2
Jesus, you know what they want?	1	2
Everything.	1	2
Especially if the other girls have it.	1	2
Trust me, psychiatry is just	1	2
this year's candy-pink stove.	1	2
It's just more happiness.	1	2
People...	1	2
Are...	1	2
Funny!	1	2
Beauty and the beast.	1	2
Hey, Daddy.	1	2
Hey, there. Cold lamb sound good?	1	2
Yeah.	1	2
Someone started on the train.	1	2
In the office.	1	2
Because of a good day or a bad day?	1	2
You know, when I told you you had everything...	1	2
I was wrong.	1	2
Oh, my God.	1	2
White gold.	1	2
It's got one of those tiny little faces	1	2
that you have to be young to see.	1	2
Mm. Don, it's beautiful.	1	2
Hmm.	1	2
The guy at the store set the time,	1	2
but he was English,	1	2
so it might be six hours off.	1	2
Did you look at Sally's face?	1	2
I think she has a bruise.	1	2
I didn't see it.	1	2
On her cheekbone under her eye.	1	2
I thought that was ketchup.	1	2
What if she had gotten a scar,	1	2
something permanent?	1	2
I don't want to play what-if.	1	2
I'm just saying if it happened to Bobby it would have been okay	1	2
because a boy with a scar is nothing,	1	2
but a girl, it's so much worse.	1	2
Nothing happened.	1	2
I keep...	1	2
thinking...	1	2
Not that I c-could have killed the kids,	1	2
but... worse.	1	2
Sally could have survived...	1	2
and gone on living with this...	1	2
horrible scar on her face, and...	1	2
some long, lonely...	1	2
miserable life as...	1	2
Don.	1	2
What's happening to me?	1	2
Do I need to see someone?	1	2
I don't know.	1	2
I guess so.	1	2
Whatever you want.	1	2
11 A.M. Did you get fired?	1	2
Brought Betty into the city to see the doctor,	1	2
but, uh, honestly...	1	2
I think I'm the one that's not feeling so great.	1	2
I called in sick.	1	2
Don't bring that here.	1	2
I'm serious, Don. Don't talk to me about her.	1	2
It makes me feel cruel.	1	2
You're right.	1	2
Sometimes.	1	2
I can't decide	1	2
if you have everything...	1	2
or nothing.	1	2
I live in the moment.	1	2
Nothing is everything.	1	2
Sounds more like you live in the Village.	1	2
Actually, I live in the hall.	1	2
I lost my key.	1	2
I had to, um... spend the night abroad.	1	2
Could you be a gentleman	1	2
and break in to the fire escape	1	2
so I don't have to?	1	2
Draper in yet?	1	2
He's not coming in today. He's not feeling well.	1	2
I'm leaving. Don't tell anyone I was here.	1	2
Bienvenue.	1	2
No, it's Peggy.	1	2
Hello.	1	2
I don't think I can go out to lunch today.	1	2
Mr. Draper's not coming in.	1	2
That means you can go out to lunch.	1	2
Have you never worked in an office before?	1	2
Well, he could call.	1	2
It's my second week.	1	2
Another time?	1	2
I did enjoy the tour the other day.	1	2
It was eye-opening.	1	2
I didn't think your eyes could be any wider.	1	2
That's clever.	1	2
I guess I'll go to the cart. You want something?	1	2
What?	1	2
The office is gonna empty out any second.	1	2
We can push the couch in front of the door.	1	2
Paul.	1	2
Do you belong to someone else?	1	2
Shit.	1	2
I don't even like to sit in Don's chair.	1	2
I think we've misunderstood each other.	1	2
But there is someone else, right?	1	2
Yes.	1	2
I hope you know that covering your typewriter	1	2
"is office code for ""I'm done for the day."""	1	2
I'm not feeling so swell.	1	2
Neither am I. Look at these letters you typed after lunch.	1	2
Terre Haute, Indiana, has two Rs and an A	1	2
and an E at the end.	1	2
I think either you missed home row by a hand,	1	2
or you were out drinking with the junior account boys again.	1	2
I wasn't drinking.	1	2
I don't like your tone.	1	2
I'll redo these right away.	1	2
Look at you, all in a snit.	1	2
Are you gonna watch me?	1	2
What is wrong with you?	1	2
Honestly, why is it that every time	1	2
a man takes you out to lunch around here,	1	2
you're... you're the dessert?	1	2
That's terrible.	1	2
It's constant from every corner.	1	2
I'm from Bay Ridge. We have manners.	1	2
Why can't they just leave it alone?	1	2
Because men always bother you all the time.	1	2
They follow you down the street.	1	2
Well, not exactly.	1	2
Look, dear, I don't know you that well,	1	2
but you're the new girl, and you're not much,	1	2
so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts.	1	2
Of course.	1	2
Don't be that way.	1	2
I'm just offering some perspective, that's all.	1	2
Thank you, Joan.	1	2
I'll save my thank-yous	1	2
till you correct that correspondence.	1	2

It's like when you have a problem with your car	1	2
and you go to the mechanic	1	2
and it's not doing it anymore.	1	2
Not that you are a mechanic.	1	2
I guess a lot of people must come here	1	2

Is that true?	1	2
It's a common nightmare, people say.	1	2

It's 7:30.	1	2
I have to go to Roy's reading.	1	2
I have to be there to act surprised	1	2

Oh.	1	2

It's because I'm the man.	1	2
You seem to forget that sometimes.	1	2
I'm lucky they aren't all like you.	1	2
I'll take that as a compliment.	1	2
What do women want?	1	2
Well, one of the things has to be	1	2
not being asked something like that.	1	2
"""What do women want?"	1	2
"You know better than to ask."""	1	2
Give me a pen.	1	2
Jesus.	1	2
"""What do women want?"""	1	2
"""Any excuse to get closer."""	1	2
Thank God.	1	2
There's that ego people pay to see.	1	2
I'll have the filet of sole.	1	2
Excellent.	1	2
Creamed spinach or creamed corn?	1	2
Spinach.	1	2
Fried potatoes or au gratin?	1	2
Au gratin. With tomato juice to start.	1	2
I'll have a goulash.	1	2
Very good, sir.	1	2
Vodka gimlet.	1	2
Old-fashioned.	1	2
How was your day?	1	2
Fine.	1	2
You know, I work with doctors.	1	2
They'll say anything you pay them to.	1	2
Of course, dear.	1	2
Dinner in the city.	1	2
I'm glad I'm hungry.	1	2
I saw an interesting thing in the Journal American.	1	2
Apparently, the phone company	1	2
wants to start charging people	1	2
for unlisted numbers.	1	2
That doesn't seem fair.	1	2
Some people agree with you,	1	2
and they're giving aliases to Ma Bell.	1	2
They call it the nom-de-phone.	1	2
Isn't that smart?	1	2
Of course, most of them are pornographic.	1	2
The best one?	1	2
Pat McGroin.	1	2
Oh, my God.	1	2
Hard to believe they could print that	1	2
in the Journal American, let alone a phone book.	1	2
This is nice.	1	2
I'll be right up.	1	2
Hello.	1	2
Sorry to bother you so late.	1	2
It's Don Draper.	1	2
Oh, hello, Mr. Draper.	1	2
No, no. It's not too late at all.	1	2
Glad to hear that.	1	2
Well?	1	2
Well, I had a very interesting hour	1	2
with your wife this afternoon.	1	2
She's a very anxious young woman.	1	2
I think you're doing the right thing.	1	2

Hey. Dick?	1	3
Richard Whitman?	1	3
Holy smokes, is that you?	1	3
Ha! As I live and breathe.	1	3
It's me. Larry.	1	3
Krisinski, L. Fort Sill?	1	3
Oh, of course. Larry, look at you.	1	3
Yeah, and you.	1	3
Still haven't filled out. You must be a bachelor.	1	3
No.	1	3
 Where are you at? I'm out of Waltham, Mass.	1	3
I'm just spending a day in Armonk	1	3
with International Business Machines.	1	3
I'm upstate.	1	3
Hey, I just saw Jerry Creighton.	1	3
Remember? Slept with a sidearm in his bunk.	1	3
Almost blew his jaw off?	1	3
Yeah, I remember that.	1	3
Yeah, well... Look, I should, uh...	1	3
Call me. We should catch up.	1	3
Absolutely.	1	3
Old Dick Whitman.	1	3
Ha! What are the chances?	1	3
Good morning, Hollis.	1	3
 I mean, it's France. What do they want with the bomb?	1	3
We must have given it to them.	1	3
No way the frogs came up with it on their own.	1	3
Hey, it's the honeymoon kid. Hey.	1	3
Here comes Romeo without his roe, like a dried herring.	1	3
Do I seem different?	1	3
You do look depleted, Humps.	1	3
The wedding was great.	1	3
How was the rest of it?	1	3
You're talking about my wife here.	1	3
Oh, she's already got you there?	1	3
Gentlemen never discuss this.	1	3
We're talking about you here:	1	3
"the man who told us the coat check girl from ""21"""	1	3
had tangerine panties.	1	3
Come on, buddy boy, spill.	1	3
I don't know.	1	3
Something happened in the ceremony.	1	3
It's when he said that thing about being new baptized.	1	3
I just felt this calm come over me.	1	3
So what you're saying is, uh, a lot of missionary?	1	3
Fine.	1	3
So she's laying there, right?	1	3
And she kept looking at the maps,	1	3
talking about all the things we were going to do...	1	3
but we never did.	1	3
Ladies Home Journal. I can get that at Mom's.	1	3
Welcome back, Mr. Campbell.	1	3
Well, hey, there.	1	3
The ring, it's like catnip.	1	3
Did you know that 600,000 gallons of water go over the Falls per second?	1	3
Per second!	1	3
Oh, look. He's back.	1	3
Good morning.	1	3
Congratulations. Welcome back.	1	3
Thanks, everybody.	1	3
When did this place get so friendly?	1	3
I guess people missed you.	1	3
Welcome back, Mr. Campbell. Hildy.	1	3
Close the door!	1	3
Close the door!	1	3
Who put the Chinamen in my office?	1	3
Welcome back.	1	3
They paid an Oriental family	1	3
to be in Mr. Campbell's office.	1	3
Someone will finally be working in there.	1	3
Mr. Romano, Mr. Kinsey, and Mr. Crane	1	3
are here for your meeting.	1	3
Do you need a minute?	1	3
Do you need a minute? You must.	1	3
You keep moving the Secor laxative discussion.	1	3
See what we did to Campbell's office?	1	3
What do we have?	1	3
Let me remind you,	1	3
safe and reliable would make me doze off	1	3
if I wasn't so blighted	1	3
by the scourge of constipation.	1	3
Well, what can I say? I'm blocked.	1	3
I told you he wouldn't think that was funny.	1	3
I got one.	1	3
"How 'bout ""Secor. It's satisfeculant""?"	1	3
Stay in the art department, Sal.	1	3
I'm just saying we can be funny,	1	3
like those Volkswagen people.	1	3
You see this yet?	1	3
I have.	1	3
I don't know what I hate about it the most,	1	3
the ad or the car.	1	3
You know, they did one last year.	1	3
"Same kind of smirk. Remember ""Think small""?"	1	3
It was a half-page ad in a full-page buy.	1	3
You could barely see the product.	1	3
I don't get it.	1	3
Elvis just got back from West Germany.	1	3
Why not put him in it?	1	3
They must be getting results.	1	3
They keep going back to the well.	1	3
I want the Chinamen out of the building by lunch.	1	3
I'm still waiting on my shirts.	1	3
You've seen this?	1	3
I'm back now. I see that.	1	3
So...	1	3
I should be on the list for the meeting.	1	3
Oh, I just...	1	3
I didn't know when you were coming back.	1	3
Right.	1	3
Yeah, well, it's today. Here I am.	1	3
They're all in there already. You can go in.	1	3
Peggy...	1	3
When I came over that night,	1	3
you know, before.	1	3
I was there.	1	3
You know...	1	3
I'm married now.	1	3
I know.	1	3
So...	1	3
Pete...	1	3
I understand.	1	3
It never happened.	1	3
You want me to buzz you in?	1	3
The door looks a little bit open.	1	3
Sorry about that. I took the Chinese out of the building.	1	3
But I have a feeling in an hour	1	3
I'm gonna want to take them out again.	1	3
Bernbach. He's a Jew.	1	3
If I were him,	1	3
I wouldn't want to help reindustrialize Germany.	1	3
Everybody's got a price.	1	3
Oh, yeah, I saw that.	1	3
Honesty. It's a great angle.	1	3
No chrome, no horsepower,	1	3
foreign, ugly.	1	3
Guess they went with their strengths.	1	3
It is funny. It is?	1	3
'Cause I think the joke's on us.	1	3
You're supposed to look at that	1	3
and say it's a great car, not a great ad.	1	3
I laughed. I think it's brilliant.	1	3
Brilliant.	1	3
I'll tell you what brilliance	1	3
in advertising is: 99 cents.	1	3
Somebody thought of that, Campbell.	1	3
Well, say what you want. Love it or hate it,	1	3
the fact remains we've been talking about this	1	3
for the last 15 minutes.	1	3
And this is Playboy.	1	3
Of course, what we should have been talking about	1	3
is Secor laxative,	1	3
unless, as it appears,	1	3
there is nothing to say.	1	3
I don't want to hear this.	1	3
We're on the case.	1	3
Part of this job	1	3
is doing things you don't want to do.	1	3
Most of it.	1	3
It's good to be back, Draper. I missed you.	1	3
Then it must not have been much of a honeymoon.	1	3
I'm sorry. Welcome back.	1	3
How's married life?	1	3
It's pretty swell.	1	3
I was raised that men don't wear jewelry.	1	3
I kind of like it.	1	3
Trudy's a lot funnier than I thought.	1	3
I'm actually looking forward to going home tonight.	1	3
Well, I look forward to meeting her.	1	3
Hey, maybe one of these nights	1	3
we could get dinner together	1	3
with the, uh, wives.	1	3
Maybe we can.	1	3
You know, girls, we'd be happy to bring you coffee.	1	3
I was on my way over anyways.	1	3
I have something of yours. Ooh.	1	3
Lady Chatterley's Lover. I finished it last night.	1	3
Good to the last drop, right?	1	3
Well, I can see why it got banned.	1	3
Well, you don't have to be so shy about it.	1	3
It's literature.	1	3
That is a huge pocketbook, Joan.	1	3
Well, it's got a change of clothing	1	3
and a toothbrush in it.	1	3
Ha ha. A hope chest.	1	3
Have you read this, Peggy?	1	3
I don't think that's a good idea.	1	3
There's, um...	1	3
this word in it a lot.	1	3
I know the word, Joan.	1	3
Well, it's sad, really,	1	3
because even with its reputation, men won't read it.	1	3
And they really should.	1	3
I don't care if it's 500 years old.	1	3
It's another testimony to how most people think marriage is a joke.	1	3
They rip a lot of clothing.	1	3
Yeah, it's a fantasy.	1	3
He's married, and she's married.	1	3
The desperate passion of the forbidden.	1	3
Can I borrow it?	1	3
She's making it sound better than it is.	1	3
There's a few good parts, that's all.	1	3
And the book just opens to those pages by itself.	1	3
Hey, don't read it on the train.	1	3
It'll attract the wrong element.	1	3
Bye. Bye.	1	3
"So the doctor says to him, ""I hope you're happy."	1	3
"""While you were out finishing a round of golf,"	1	3
"""your wife was in a horrible accident."	1	3
"""She is gonna need 'round-the-clock care."	1	3
"Bathing, toilet."""	1	3
Then the doc looks at him and says,	1	3
"""I'm just kidding. She's dead."	1	3
"Hey, what'd you shoot?"""	1	3
initial research report	1	3
and what I think are some very astute market observations.	1	3
Mr. Draper.	1	3
Pleased to see you didn't disappear	1	3
the minute you cashed my check.	1	3
We appreciate your business.	1	3
Kenny, of course, you know.	1	3
Harry Crane, media.	1	3
And Mr. George Pelham over here,	1	3
who is from research,	1	3
and who has more degrees than a Russian protractor.	1	3
That's quite an introduction.	1	3
From the other side of the pond, I see.	1	3
We take his word for it.	1	3
So, uh, that is yours to keep.	1	3
But if you'd like to follow along,	1	3
you'll see from the overview	1	3
our primary focus was Saks,	1	3
Henri Bendel, and Bonwit Teller.	1	3
Our research uncovered a variety of options they utilize to attract	1	3
your desired customers.	1	3
One thing these stores have in common	1	3
is a comfortable shopping environment.	1	3
Spacious, open sales floors,	1	3
An almost conspicuous lack of clutter.	1	3
Merchandise is minimal	1	3
and neatly presented on tables	1	3
and in display cases.	1	3
"This ""less is more"" philosophy"	1	3
is also evident in the window displays.	1	3
For example, only one sweater to a window,	1	3
as opposed to windows stuffed with merchandise.	1	3
My father's going to love that.	1	3
Believe it or not, it even applies to the mannequins.	1	3
Bendel's takes the heads off theirs	1	3
so the shopper can imagine them to be anyone.	1	3
Anyone without a head.	1	3
Along with these cosmetic changes,	1	3
you'll also need to provide what we call boutique extras.	1	3
A personal shopping service,	1	3
private fashion shows,	1	3
and designer collections.	1	3
This is comprehensive.	1	3
It's the lay of the land.	1	3
Just from holding it, I feel more informed	1	3
about my competitors than ever.	1	3
And yet my store already has	1	3
a personal shopping service	1	3
and designer collections,	1	3
which makes me wonder if you were so focused on my competitors	1	3
that you failed to visit my store.	1	3
I've been away on my honeymoon.	1	3
I've been there a few times.	1	3
It's a beautiful old place.	1	3
Miss Menken, I can assure you	1	3
that no one at this table	1	3
has ever been to your store.	1	3
A wrong I will personally correct	1	3
this afternoon.	1	3
It's right on 5th Avenue.	1	3
That's one big block over	1	3
and a dozen little blocks up.	1	3
It's been there for 30 years.	1	3
I'll walk you out. I've got it.	1	3
Harry.	1	3
What?	1	3
It was nice the way you handled that.	1	3
It's hard to get caught in a lie.	1	3
Well, it wasn't a lie.	1	3
It was ineptitude with insufficient cover.	1	3
Something about the way you talk always restores my confidence.	1	3
I have a deep voice.	1	3
This afternoon, then.	1	3
It's a date.	1	3
New junior exec.	1	3
Changing her store could take six months...	1	3
Or a year, if I know what's good for me.	1	3
What was that in there? What?	1	3
Don and Molly Goldberg. Did you see that?	1	3
Yeah, I caught it. What's your point?	1	3
I don't know. I mean, everybody always jokes about it,	1	3
but I've never seen Draper really turn that switch on before.	1	3
I guess he likes her. What would you do?	1	3
Trying to quit.	1	3
You are really putting the junior	1	3
in junior executive.	1	3
Look, you're married now, all right?	1	3
I'm a part of that club, too. Two very happy years.	1	3
But when I'm out in the world...	1	3
I don't know. I don't do it much.	1	3
I'm not good at it...	1	3
The flirting, the double entendres...	1	3
You mean something on the side?	1	3
No. I mean enjoying the company of women	1	3
in the limited way a married man can.	1	3
It's all we have, really.	1	3
I can't speak for everyone, but it's plenty for me.	1	3
Same. I guess on some level,	1	3
I always thought Draper was the same way.	1	3
Draper?	1	3
Who knows anything about that guy.	1	3
No one's ever lifted that rock.	1	3
He could be Batman for all we know.	1	3
Mr. Campbell, you wife's on the phone.	1	3
There's bird shit on the couch.	1	3
That was priceless.	1	3
Hello, honey.	1	3
Dinner? Wow.	1	3
What do I want for dinner?	1	3
Hmm... I don't know.	1	3
Anything but chicken.	1	3
Yes, they missed me.	1	3
Uh, rib eye in the pan with butter.	1	3
Ice cream.	1	3
I love you, too.	1	3
There's going to be dinner waiting for me when I get home.	1	3
Yeah. How about that?	1	3
Mr. Kurland was mitigating a skirmish	1	3
in our housewares section.	1	3
Why do I hire young girls?	1	3
Because they cost practically nothing.	1	3
Costume change.	1	3
This is my closet.	1	3
The original tenants laid the last brick	1	3
the day before the crash.	1	3
Boy, were they in for a surprise.	1	3
As I hope you know by now,	1	3
our original store was just off 7th Avenue.	1	3
It was just hosiery.	1	3
Then they started pulling piecework from sweatshops.	1	3
By 1932, these people had failed.	1	3
My father and uncle picked this place up for a shekel.	1	3
Well, it is crowded.	1	3
But that might have something to do with the sale,	1	3
which means that, if we're successful,	1	3
you're gonna lose the customers you have	1	3
in order to get the customers you want.	1	3
I was gonna start with raising prices.	1	3
Can you imagine what my father said?	1	3
Well, you do have to give them something	1	3
for their higher dollar count.	1	3
It's just awfully hard to define what that is.	1	3
How may I help you?	1	3
I make them say that.	1	3
Carol, can we see this tray right here?	1	3
Sea horses,	1	3
crowns,	1	3
lucky dice.	1	3
Medieval knights.	1	3
That's better. Hmm.	1	3
Thank you.	1	3
Let's take a look at the second floor.	1	3
We're known for our service.	1	3
That's gotta be a tough job.	1	3
I know.	1	3
I've always liked how quiet it is up here.	1	3
Well, that might explain the lack of customers.	1	3
I can see the charm, but...	1	3
the room is too dark, too old-fashioned.	1	3
The products look old.	1	3
But the people look wonderful.	1	3
It's a shame we're gonna have to lop their heads off.	1	3
It'll ruin your favorite part of the store.	1	3
It's not my favorite part, actually.	1	3
The grand lot of us are going to Lansky's.	1	3
Can you believe it?	1	3
Have a swell time. I've got plans.	1	3
You look nice.	1	3
Hell.	1	3
Manhattan at your feet. I can see the appeal.	1	3
The view's okay.	1	3
Now, this is my favorite part of the store.	1	3
Hey there, Missy.	1	3
Hey.	1	3
I haven't seen you in a while.	1	3
Hey. How did they get the penthouse?	1	3
They patrol.	1	3
It's the only way to make sure	1	3
there isn't anyone hiding in the store at night.	1	3
Well, they know I'm with you, right?	1	3
These two are Carla and Leona.	1	3
Not the originals, but third generation,	1	3
and what every generation of Menken dog	1	3
shall be named until the end of time.	1	3
I made my father's legal counsel add that	1	3
to the store's by-laws when I was 9.	1	3
So even then you enjoyed telling men what to do.	1	3
To be fair, the store was practically home.	1	3
My father liked to work.	1	3
I used to come out here and talk to them...	1	3
Well, the originals...	1	3
Every night.	1	3
For a little girl, a dog can be all you need.	1	3
They protect you. They listen.	1	3
I had my sister, but there weren't other kids.	1	3
And, of course, my mother wasn't around.	1	3
Well, that's not always a bad thing.	1	3
Who knows?	1	3
She died when she was having me.	1	3
Anyway, my sister became my only company.	1	3
And frankly,	1	3
these bitches were easier to handle.	1	3
What is this?	1	3
Don't try to convince me that you were ever unloved.	1	3
I don't know what to say.	1	3
Listen...	1	3
I'm married.	1	3
I guess I didn't ask 'cause I didn't want to know.	1	3
That shouldn't have happened.	1	3
Well, you couldn't help yourself.	1	3
I knew what I wanted...	1	3
from the first time you stormed out of our office.	1	3
You stormed out of your office.	1	3
I took you up here. That was stupid.	1	3
I just so looked forward to seeing you again.	1	3
Now I guess that's over.	1	3
I know you understand	1	3
I'd rather not have to explain this to anyone.	1	3
The account stays.	1	3
I just want someone else on it.	1	3
Don't look at me like that.	1	3
What do you do, just kiss women all the time?	1	3
Women you aren't married to?	1	3
Of course not.	1	3
Well, then, am I supposed to live some life	1	3
running alongside yours?	1	3
I have some checks to sign.	1	3
Excuse me.	1	3
You dropped your paper.	1	3
Thank you.	1	3
Daddy!	1	3
Daddy! Daddy!	1	3
Wake up. It's my birthday.	1	3
It's my birthday! Raah!	1	3
It's my birthday!	1	3
It's not your birthday. It's your party.	1	3
Don, the party's at 2:00.	1	3
You have to put together the P-L-A-Y-H-O-U-S-E.	1	3
How am I going to put together a pony?	1	3
A pony? I'm getting a pony?	1	3
Bobby, I'm getting a pony!	1	3
Great.	1	3
She'll forget all about it when she sees the playhouse.	1	3
There's a bacon and egg sandwich for you on the range.	1	3
It's got a red door like ours!	1	3
Daddy!	1	3
You are not supposed to see this yet.	1	3
Why don't you run to the garage	1	3
and get me another beer?	1	3
Okay.	1	3
Capers?	1	3
You want to pick those out of the rug?	1	3
Well, they look naked.	1	3
Well, the only thing this one wants is raw hamburger.	1	3
What does that mean?	1	3
I think that's enough of that.	1	3
Well, how many are we?	1	3
Us, you...	1	3
Carlton's with the kids. Make it quick.	1	3
The Darlings, Helen Bishop...	1	3
You didn't. I had to.	1	3
She saw me buying balloons at the market.	1	3
Didn't seem right. So what?	1	3
I just brought her the pie, got my dish back at the end.	1	3
Have you seen her walking up Downtree Ridge?	1	3
Where the hell is she walking to?	1	3
I don't know.	1	3
How old is her kid?	1	3
Kids.	1	3
The boy is 9.	1	3
I'm gonna say Gary, maybe Glen?	1	3
Mm-hmm. And the baby is a 2-year-old.	1	3
She said she was gonna try and get a sitter.	1	3
I would.	1	3
It's probably a big event for her.	1	3
That man.	1	3
I know.	1	3
You didn't use the powder room, did you?	1	3
It will appear untouched.	1	3
Everyone's gonna be here soon.	1	3
Why don't you go up and take a shower?	1	3
Want company?	1	3
Mint juleps. It's that time of year.	1	3
Wonderful. I'm so thirsty lately.	1	3
Ready or not, here I come!	1	3
There's date nut bread, cold turkey,	1	3
and Waldorf salad for the adults.	1	3
And I just made peanut butter sandwiches for the kids.	1	3
I know everybody eats that.	1	3
Thank you.	1	3
And in case anybody's going to ask,	1	3
I did not get that clown.	1	3
Oh. Oh.	1	3
He got booked in some off-Broadway show.	1	3
About clowns? I think we saw that.	1	3
It's not the one	1	3
where they take their clothes off, is it?	1	3
Who knew that could be boring?	1	3
Want something a little stronger there, Carlton?	1	3
He'll manage.	1	3
We were thinking about you, Don.	1	3
We saw this thing on TV.	1	3
It was right in the middle of the news. It was cute.	1	3
The guy flying with his hat on.	1	3
Did you do that one? It was so cute.	1	3
I think the man looks exactly like Henry. Except not as handsome.	1	3
I haven't seen that.	1	3
I'm going to go and leave the kids' food out.	1	3
Let's not even bother trying to get them to sit.	1	3
I'll co-pilot.	1	3
Heard a good one the other day.	1	3
No, Chet.	1	3
I'm gonna tell the joke.	1	3
Your wife and your lawyer are drowning.	1	3
You have a choice to make:	1	3
you go to lunch or a movie?	1	3
It's good, right?	1	3
Hey, I'm missing the ball game.	1	3
I might as well have some fun.	1	3
Hey.	1	3
So how are things on Mad Ave, Don?	1	3
Looks like they're taking care of you.	1	3
We got it all, huh?	1	3
Yep, this is it.	1	3
Maybe it's his obsession with sports,	1	3
but it's been hard for Jack.	1	3
Marilyn, I've been watching Kevin,	1	3
and he gets around very well.	1	3
Hmm.	1	3
I bet he doesn't know the difference.	1	3
He does.	1	3
He's very determined.	1	3
Jack really gets angry	1	3
anytime someone mentions the vaccine,	1	3
and I tell him we should be grateful.	1	3
First of all, it could have been much worse.	1	3
It could have gotten to his lungs.	1	3
Second of all, this can't happen to other children.	1	3
They think they're athletes.	1	3
I want to say to Chet,	1	3
"""I saw you play football in high school."	1	3
"Your son's going to be a tackling dummy just like you."""	1	3
According to Glen here,	1	3
when the door's a little bit open,	1	3
you're supposed to come in.	1	3
Hello, Helen.	1	3
I hate to start with a bunch of excuses,	1	3
but the babysitter was late,	1	3
and I still haven't unpacked all the boxes,	1	3
so this was the only paper I could find.	1	3
It should be Christmas all year	1	3
as far as I'm concerned.	1	3
A jury in New York City	1	3
is expected to receive the tax evasion paper...	1	3
Opera's production	1	3
of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro,	1	3
with Robert Merrill and Joan Sutherland.	1	3
Don, you have to pick up the cake from Hightop.	1	3
Oh, and this is Helen Bishop	1	3
and Glen.	1	3
Nice to meet you all.	1	3
Don. He goes with me.	1	3
Then Carlton, Chet, and Jack.	1	3
Glen, I'm pretty sure there are	1	3
some peanut butter sandwiches and a BB gun	1	3
out there in the backyard.	1	3
Why don't you come with me?	1	3
Don, can I speak with you?	1	3
Let's see, I told you about the cake,	1	3
and... oh, can you take some movies this time?	1	3
Of everyone or just Chief Tiny Tim?	1	3
You bought that camera, and you always forget.	1	3
Okay.	1	3
Ladies, ladies, this is Helen Bishop.	1	3
This is Marilyn. Nice to meet you.	1	3
And Nancy.	1	3
She seems scared, poor thing.	1	3
Trust me, those hens are gonna peck her to death.	1	3
Do you see her running around	1	3
in that little Volkswagen?	1	3
That's kind of desperate.	1	3
That won't help her. It's got no back seat.	1	3
She'll have to find some midget hitchhiker.	1	3
Last time I saw one of those,	1	3
I think I was throwing a grenade into it.	1	3
Yeah.	1	3
The problem with Easter break	1	3
is it's too long.	1	3
The doldrums.	1	3
We're thinking about seven days, six nights,	1	3
in Boca Raton,	1	3
with mosquitoes as big as a silver dollar.	1	3
And believe me, those aren't the only giant noses	1	3
you'll have to deal with.	1	3
Francine.	1	3
Carlton and I went there on our honeymoon,	1	3
and all I can say is we were outnumbered.	1	3
It's uncomfortable.	1	3
You want to be able to relax.	1	3
We went to Bermuda on our honeymoon.	1	3
Pink sand beaches.	1	3
Oh! Mmm!	1	3
Where did you go?	1	3
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.	1	3
It's okay. I went to Paris.	1	3
Four years of Mount Holyoke French.	1	3
Haven't used it since.	1	3
And I wouldn't give it back,	1	3
even being with Glen's father.	1	3
Is that your ex-husband?	1	3
Yes.	1	3
I went to Italy.	1	3
Not on my honeymoon,	1	3
but right after I graduated from Bryn Mawr.	1	3
What a summer.	1	3
Three Coins in the Fountain.	1	3
It was right about that time.	1	3
You must have loved Paris.	1	3
It's all walking.	1	3
What do you mean?	1	3
Just that I've seen you	1	3
walking around the neighborhood.	1	3
I've seen you, too,	1	3
when I was driving. I think I waved.	1	3
Where are you going when you do that?	1	3
No place. I just like to walk.	1	3
But where?	1	3
Anywhere.	1	3
It just relaxes me and clears my mind.	1	3
I heard on the radio that Einstein did it.	1	3
Einstein? He's got his hands into everything.	1	3

Ahem. It's, uh, it's Helen, right?	1	3
I know your situation,	1	3
and my heart breaks for that little boy.	1	3
I have a baby, too.	1	3
You can act strong,	1	3
but I just want to volunteer.	1	3
If you ever need someone	1	3
to throw the ball around with him some Sunday,	1	3
take him to the beach.	1	3
That would be nice.	1	3
I'm sure eventually	1	3
I'd get so used to your Sunday visits,	1	3
I'd join you at the beach,	1	3
just the four of us.	1	3
Then one night, you'd drop us off at the house	1	3
and walk me in with an umbrella.	1	3
The kids would go to sleep,	1	3
and we'd laugh about all the funny things	1	3
that happened at the beach that day.	1	3
I don't want you telling Francine	1	3
that I suggested something that I didn't.	1	3
Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood.	1	3

Same crowd out here.	1	3
How about the Einstein thing?	1	3
I wonder if old Albert	1	3
swung his hips like that when he walked.	1	3
She probably got her hair tips from him, too.	1	3
Glen is so quiet.	1	3
Not to mention wrinkled.	1	3
Maybe she hasn't unpacked her iron, either.	1	3
Christmas paper? Please.	1	3
She works.	1	3
It has to be hard to run a house, too.	1	3
Manning a counter at a jewelry store?	1	3
It's not that demanding.	1	3
I don't know. I had a job in sales before I was a mom.	1	3
Have you seen my mom?	1	3
No, honey. Maybe she's in the dining room.	1	3
Betty.	1	3
What?	1	3
Don, will you please go to Hightop and get the cake?	1	3
Hey. Don't run in the house.	1	3
What is going on in here?	1	3
Your kid knocked over a drink.	1	3
You need to tell him this is not a jungle gym.	1	3

No. Come on. He heard me.	1	3

Okay. Thank you.	1	3
The woman at the bakery said	1	3
he picked up the cake almost an hour ago.	1	3
Do you think he had an accident?	1	3

H- How fast were you going when Mr. Adams jumped from the car?	1	4
75?	1	4
And... And where was that?	1	4
L- In your driveway?	1	4
H- How far had Mr. Adams gotten in the lesson?	1	4
B- Backing out?	1	4
It's not Lenny Bruce, but it's good.	1	4
This is better. It's funny.	1	4
This guy used to be an accountant. Did you know that?	1	4
Really?	1	4
He's not anymore, is he?	1	4
 Your wife is here, Mr. Campbell.	1	4
Thank you, Hildy.	1	4
Lunch date. Good idea.	1	4
You married folks.	1	4
Must be nice to spend some time together.	1	4
Hello, lovely.	1	4
You can do better than that.	1	4
Trudy, you know the fellas:	1	4
Ken, Paul, and Harry, of course.	1	4
You'll notice only men coming out of there.	1	4
I know you all work so hard.	1	4
How's Jennifer?	1	4
Good. Swell, actually,	1	4
considering she's still at the phone company.	1	4
 Nothing I can do.	1	4
That's not true. You could give her a baby.	1	4
You'll all in on it together.	1	4
Nice to see you all again.	1	4
Do we have a lunch date?	1	4
Because Hildy, she can show you the book.	1	4
No, but I'm taking you away.	1	4
Trudy, I don't think taking you to lunch is part of my job.	1	4
Do you have something today?	1	4
No.	1	4
I thought you'd be happy to see me.	1	4
I called Hildy and asked if you were free.	1	4
It'll only take a minute, I promise.	1	4
I'm sorry. It's great. Where are we going?	1	4
It's a surprise.	1	4
Ah, Don, I'd like you to meet my wife, Trudy Campbell.	1	4
Don Draper. Nice to meet you.	1	4
Congratulations. You're a very lucky girl.	1	4
I know. Most of my friends can't find a good man.	1	4
Believe me. I'm the lucky one.	1	4
Yes, you are.	1	4
He's essential to the process around here.	1	4
I think we're almost as happy to have him as you are.	1	4
Oh, I don't think that's possible.	1	4
Well, maybe you're right.	1	4
Nice to meet you.	1	4
He's so nice.	1	4
Not at all like what I imagined.	1	4
1,500 square feet. Two nice bedrooms.	1	4
I don't know if that includes that maid's room.	1	4
Have to be a pretty small maid.	1	4
It's on the market for 32,	1	4
but Elaine, the realtor, says we can get it for 30.	1	4
Lovely, you know that I want to give you everything.	1	4
We don't have to pay for the whole thing at once.	1	4
We can get a mortgage.	1	4
Trudy, I make $75 a week.	1	4
Now, I know you're not good at math,	1	4
but that's $3,500 a year.	1	4
You'll make more.	1	4
Eventually.	1	4
But if we put 10% down,	1	4
that's an entire year's salary.	1	4
Sweetheart, we're not in this alone.	1	4
We're a young couple that needs a little help.	1	4
Did you see the sink in the master bathroom?	1	4
It's the same one they have in The Pierre.	1	4
Bill it all to Menken's, Fred.	1	4
The girl knows where I keep the accounts.	1	4
Hello.	1	4
Mr. Draper.	1	4
Didn't expect to see you back here.	1	4
Well, we're, uh, screening a television commercial.	1	4
It'll probably look better when it's breaking up Bonanza.	1	4
His work is wonderful.	1	4
He's perfect for Menken's.	1	4
So he keeps telling me.	1	4
Well, I'll let you see Miss Menken out.	1	4
How are you?	1	4
I'm fine.	1	4
My family is fine.	1	4
The weather has been spectacular.	1	4
Rachel, listen...	1	4
What are you doing?	1	4
I don't know.	1	4
I don't want it to be like this.	1	4
Yes, well...	1	4
we both know how we'd like it to be.	1	4
Can we at least have lunch sometime?	1	4
I really can't see a reason for that.	1	4
"""Church bells rang out,"	1	4
"""and the air was filled with flying birds."	1	4
"""What a joyous parade it was back at the palace."	1	4
"No king could command anything finer. """	1	4
The end.	1	4
The end.	1	4
Again?	1	4
Daddy will see you in the morning.	1	4
Helen, come on. I know you're in there.	1	4
Damn it! Helen! Open the door!	1	4
Excuse me, Miss.	1	4
I know you can hear me. Miss?	1	4
Look, can I use your phone?	1	4
I'm her husband.	1	4
I'm supposed to see my kids, and I know she's in there.	1	4
I just called from the gas station.	1	4
No. I'm sorry.	1	4
Are you serious?	1	4
I'm sure you are who you say you are,	1	4
but I don't let strange men into my home.	1	4
Come on.	1	4
Can I come in?	1	4
Of course.	1	4
I'm really sorry.	1	4
I'm so embarrassed.	1	4
I don't know what you're talking about.	1	4
Yes, you do. I was at the window.	1	4
Did you let him in?	1	4
Yes.	1	4
He's not a bad man.	1	4
Do you want some coffee?	1	4
It's a joke, really.	1	4
Dan hardly saw the kids at all when we were married.	1	4
He works in Manhattan. Life insurance.	1	4
Now, all of a sudden, he can't live without them.	1	4
Of course, if he does die, I'm set.	1	4
I'm joking.	1	4
What happened?	1	4
I'll tell you exactly.	1	4
He had a lot of friends in the city.	1	4
There was poker and tennis, drinks at the River Club.	1	4
Turned out none of them were men.	1	4
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.	1	4
I really just meant tonight what happened.	1	4
Please, I figure I might as well say it.	1	4
That's what you've all been guessing anyway, right?	1	4
We haven't all been doing anything.	1	4
Okay.	1	4
The strangest part of it	1	4
is that I think he's angrier at me than I am at him.	1	4
Of course my father got a lawyer,	1	4
an army buddy who just hammered the hell out of him.	1	4
I've always loved that house.	1	4
Hello.	1	4
He has to go right upstairs and have complete quiet for a while.	1	4
He works so hard.	1	4
I should get back.	1	4
My kids are asleep.	1	4
Boat's in the water.	1	4
Your cousin Sara had her baby.	1	4
Named it after your Uncle Skip.	1	4
I think that's nice.	1	4
Everything's all ready in the trunks.	1	4
We do hope you and Trudy	1	4
will be making it out to the house this summer.	1	4
We'll try, but I'm not sure	1	4
I'll be able to take the time off from work.	1	4
Work? Ha. I still don't understand what you do.	1	4
I'd hate for you to miss the blackberries.	1	4
Run into you at the club, you're working.	1	4
At a restaurant, you're working.	1	4
Taking people out to dinner,	1	4
wining and whoring.	1	4
No job for a white man.	1	4
She's made such a nice addition to the table.	1	4
So nice and appreciative.	1	4
There's a lot more to it than that.	1	4
Advertising. Really?	1	4
See, if someone were to tell me there's a lot more to the law,	1	4
I'd believe him.	1	4
I can't explain how business works to you.	1	4
Trudy found an apartment that she likes.	1	4
Did she? Whereabouts?	1	4
83rd and Park. Very nice.	1	4
Are you sure you want to be that far uptown?	1	4
It's not that far, Dad.	1	4
It falls off after 79th.	1	4
No, darling. They fall off after 86th.	1	4
It's a very nice area.	1	4
It is.	1	4
And, well...	1	4
it's actually kind of expensive,	1	4
so we're going to need help with the down payment.	1	4
Really?	1	4
Yes.	1	4
No, I don't think that's a good idea.	1	4
And why is that?	1	4
I just don't think it's a good idea.	1	4
You thought it was a good idea to help Bud	1	4
when he hit that girl on her bike in Montauk last summer.	1	4
What did that cost?	1	4
I presume it's your profession	1	4
that is responsible for this lapse in your manners.	1	4
I'll pay you back.	1	4
It's not about the money, Peter.	1	4
You know that.	1	4
Why is it so hard for you people to give me anything?	1	4
We gave you everything.	1	4
We gave you your name.	1	4
And what have you done with it?	1	4
Did you have a nice visit?	1	4
They're very keen on us coming out to Fisher's Island this summer.	1	4
Can they help with the apartment?	1	4
I didn't bring it up.	1	4
My dad's been having some health problems.	1	4
Oh, sweetheart.	1	4
What's wrong with him?	1	4
Nobody knows.	1	4
Walter, how's it going?	1	4
Never have much luck,	1	4
unless I'm playing against Campbell here.	1	4
Well, he's known for losing gracefully.	1	4
You know our art director, Salvatore Romano.	1	4
Did you have a good time in the city last night?	1	4
When I come into town,	1	4
I like to do my business and go home.	1	4
Unwind with the Psalms.	1	4
No man should have to live out of a suitcase.	1	4
So what do you fellows have for me?	1	4
Well, we take for granted the things we need the most:	1	4
Water, oil, electricity... steel.	1	4
I was thinking about the last time you were here,	1	4
looking out this window at this incredible city	1	4
"and saying... ""It's all steel. """	1	4
New York City:	1	4
Brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.	1	4
The city of Pittsburgh,	1	4
brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.	1	4
The city of Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis.	1	4
Full-page ads in targeted markets:	1	4
Newspapers, trade publications.	1	4
Throw in a few billboards	1	4
so your employees can brag to their girlfriends.	1	4
They're kind of plain, aren't they?	1	4
Reminds me of those WPA ads before the war.	1	4
Walter, you've been doing this long enough.	1	4
We can throw this artwork away in a minute.	1	4
But the sentiment, the idea, it's so basic,	1	4
you feel like you already know it.	1	4
You just haven't thought of it lately.	1	4
Cities are made of steel.	1	4
Bethlehem Steel.	1	4
I might be wrong, but these feel like ads for cities.	1	4
You're making our company	1	4
look like a middleman for another product.	1	4
Well, would you prefer an I-beam on a plate	1	4
with a pat of butter on it?	1	4
No need to get cute, Don.	1	4
Just making a point.	1	4
Steel is not something that you can buy at the supermarket.	1	4
But it is a commodity.	1	4
Walter, I'm surprised.	1	4
I believe this is fairly close to what we had talked about.	1	4
We talked about a national strategy	1	4
that would involve the virtues of this essential commodity.	1	4
I believe it was more specific.	1	4
Don, Walter has expressed himself.	1	4
Now, Walter, if this does not meet your expectations,	1	4
I'm sure Don can find something that does,	1	4
right, Don?	1	4
I hate to be a pain in the ass,	1	4
but if they didn't just lay there so flat.	1	4
I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm not from a city.	1	4
They just... bother me.	1	4
Look, if we can persuade you	1	4
to stay in town another 24 hours...	1	4
back at the St. Regis, of course...	1	4
it would give us a chance	1	4
to come up with something with more impact.	1	4
Get you tickets to a Broadway show.	1	4
There's a new one: Uh, Bye Bye Birdie.	1	4
I don't like birds, either.	1	4
Well, something else, then.	1	4
Pete, I think Sal can show Mr. Veith out. Walt.	1	4
Sorry about that. They are good drawings.	1	4
No, the WPA was a very respected style.	1	4
20 years ago.	1	4
What the hell was that?	1	4
Come on, Don.	1	4
That's not the first time someone's been unhappy.	1	4
Give it a haircut.	1	4
He's a second-time guy anyway. I could feel that.	1	4
And I could feel he was sentences away.	1	4
I'm that kind of guy.	1	4
He didn't like the idea.	1	4
Someone hadn't prepared him to like the idea,	1	4
an idea he was extremely enthusiastic about three months ago.	1	4
I'm sorry I didn't lower his expectations enough.	1	4
You do your job.	1	4
Take him sailing. Get him in a bathing suit.	1	4
Leave the ideas to me.	1	4
I have ideas.	1	4
I'm sure you do.	1	4
Sterling Cooper has more failed artists and intellectuals than the Third Reich.	1	4
You know what? I have good ideas.	1	4
In fact, I used to carry around a notebook and pen just to keep track.	1	4
Direct marketing. I thought of that.	1	4
Turned out it already existed, but I arrived at it independently.	1	4
And then I come to this place,	1	4
and you people tell me I'm good with people,	1	4
which is strange	1	4
because I'd never heard that before.	1	4
Draper residence.	1	4
Betty? Helen Bishop. Are you busy?	1	4
Well... no, I'm just finishing up dinner.	1	4
Of course.	1	4
Listen, this may be truly rude, but I was wondering.	1	4
I'm supposed to be stuffing envelopes at Kennedy Headquarters tonight,	1	4
and my sitter just cancelled,	1	4
and I hate to back out because, well, you know,	1	4
New York State is so important.	1	4
I didn't know that.	1	4
Well, anyway, I was wondering	1	4
if you could come watch the kids for a few hours.	1	4
Right now?	1	4
You know what? I shouldn't have asked.	1	4
Well, let me just get dinner on the table.	1	4
I guess Don can watch the kids.	1	4
Really? Gosh, that would be wonderful.	1	4
Take your time.	1	4
Put that lemonade into the floor show.	1	4
That's a swell ideal	1	4
But how could we do that?	1	4
Oh, you're a lifesaver, truly.	1	4
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.	1	4
Hiroshima, I know.	1	4
Cleaning lady and babysitter are one.	1	4
Oh, stop.	1	4
It's charming.	1	4
That's beautiful, Glen.	1	4
Except he can wake the baby.	1	4
Glen, stop that now.	1	4
You remember Mrs. Draper?	1	4
She's going to take care of you while I'm gone.	1	4
No ironing.	1	4
Ironing?	1	4
I give him 5 cents a piece. He loves doing it,	1	4
Oh, there you are.	1	4
I swear to God, I am so exhausted when I get home from the jewelry store	1	4
that I just kick these off, and I never know where they end up.	1	4
You, Glen Bishop, in bed after The Real McCoys.	1	4
No discussions.	1	4
You look very nice.	1	4
They keep the place poorly lit.	1	4
I guess there'll be a lot of nice men there.	1	4
Yes. I guess so, although it's mostly women.	1	4
Have you seen the candidate?	1	4
On the news. He's handsome.	1	4
But I'm not sure who we're voting for.	1	4
Well, I'll bring you back some literature.	1	4
I'll be back before 10, I promise.	1	4
Glen.	1	4
You got to get that Lux soap campaign	1	4
over to Sterling Cooper.	1	4
Janet Leigh and Natalie Wood...	1	4
now, there's a day at the office.	1	4
Is that an orange?	1	4
I'm telling you, you boys, you've got it made.	1	4
Martini lunches,	1	4
gorgeous women parading through.	1	4
In my next life, I'm coming back as an ad man.	1	4
Well, there's slightly more to it than that.	1	4
Yeah? Well, I'd keep that to yourself.	1	4
I met his boss yesterday.	1	4
You should have heard the nice things he said.	1	4
He's not my boss.	1	4
Well, isn't that nice?	1	4
To be appreciated for what you do?	1	4
We have some great news.	1	4
Already?	1	4
Honestly, you two. It's not that.	1	4
We found an apartment.	1	4
Oh. Well, that's exciting, too.	1	4
Yes, well, unfortunately,	1	4
it's a bit out of our price range right now.	1	4
I've been looking in the neighborhood,	1	4
and it seems very well priced to me:	1	4
32, but the realtor says we can get it for 30.	1	4
- Around here? - 83rd, but...	1	4
- How many rooms? - Five:	1	4
Two bedrooms, two baths, a terrace.	1	4
I don't know.	1	4
I'd have to look at it first.	1	4
Oh, thank you.	1	4
Sir...	1	4
I'll take Tom or Dad, you got me?	1	4
Tom, it's very generous for you to even consider it,	1	4
but I think we'd rather wait.	1	4
For what?	1	4
Start your life already.	1	4
You're gonna be a rich bastard on your own someday,	1	4
and waiting's a bunch of bullshit.	1	4
- Tomcat. - It is.	1	4
Your confidence is really...	1	4
well, it's swell.	1	4
But honestly, I'm not sure it's a good idea.	1	4
I am.	1	4
Pete, this is an investment for me, in you.	1	4
And my jellybean over here, of course.	1	4
Oh, thank you. You're gonna love it.	1	4
We'll be so happy there.	1	4
I knew they'd help us.	1	4
I know you did.	1	4
Oh, come on.	1	4
You can't possibly be angry with me.	1	4
I'm just not sure taking that kind of money is a good idea.	1	4
He's not paying for the whole thing.	1	4
It's still a lot of money,	1	4
and I'm not sure what it means.	1	4
It means we get the apartment.	1	4
Do they get to tell us where to put the furniture?	1	4
They're not like that.	1	4
You would have taken money from your parents.	1	4
That's different.	1	4
Why?	1	4
Because that's my money.	1	4
I'll get it eventually.	1	4
So this is my money.	1	4
Sweetheart, he wants to help.	1	4
It makes him feel good.	1	4
Well, what about me?	1	4
Well, what about me?	1	4
You always get what you want, don't you?	1	4
I got you. That's all I really wanted.	1	4
Excuse me. Can we turn up Park?	1	4
I need to meet a client downtown.	1	4
Hush. It'll only take a sec.	1	4
The Armory.	1	4
When are they gonna tear that dinosaur down?	1	4
I'll be right back.	1	4
I'm in here.	1	4
Glen, I said get out.	1	4
Young man, what is wrong with you?	1	4
This room is occupied.	1	4
What do you have to say for yourself?	1	4
Glen, look at me.	1	4
That was very bad.	1	4
You know better than to walk in on someone like that.	1	4
That room is private, extremely private.	1	4
Well, that's all I'm trying to say.	1	4
Now look at me.	1	4
Don't you think you owe me an apology?	1	4
Well?	1	4
I'm sorry.	1	4
Well, good.	1	4
That's not the way to behave, okay?	1	4
Now...	1	4
It's all right. I'm not angry anymore.	1	4
You're pretty.	1	4
Well, thank you, dear.	1	4
Really pretty.	1	4
That's sweet of you to say.	1	4
How old are you?	1	4
Well, I'm the same age as your mother.	1	4
How old is your mother?	1	4
She's 32.	1	4
I'm 28.	1	4
Your hair is so beautiful. You look like a princess.	1	4
Well, I don't know about that.	1	4
Can I have some?	1	4
What?	1	4
Can I have some of your hair?	1	4
Glen, no.	1	4
Just a little piece?	1	4
Glen.	1	4
You won't even miss it.	1	4
Now off to bed with you.	1	4
And no radio.	1	4
Evening, gentlemen.	1	4
Walter, I'd like you to meet my cousins	1	4
Charlotte and Wendy.	1	4
Ladies, it's a pleasure.	1	4
We were hoping you were Pete's friends.	1	4
You must be the man of steel.	1	4
Will you look at that?	1	4
You could lose a nickel in those dimples.	1	4
I thought your cousin Wendy was a redhead.	1	4
No, that's my cousin Doris.	1	4
She wasn't available this evening.	1	4
Well, I think we can make do with this branch of the family.	1	4
I'm glad you decided to stay over.	1	4
So am I.	1	4
Hey, bottle of champagne for the table and another round of these, plus one.	1	4
You know, I had some thoughts about your campaign today.	1	4
Did you?	1	4
Well, I was trying to express the essentialness of steel,	1	4
and I thought, Bethlehem Steel:	1	4
The backbone of America.	1	4
What do you think?	1	4
Unbelievable. Did Draper tell you to try and sneak this one by me?	1	4
No. I was just...	1	4
Campbell, get off the clock.	1	4
We have two lovely ladies here.	1	4
The only backbone I'm interested in now is right here.	1	4
So, tell me, Wendy, what do you do	1	4
when you're not lighting up rooms with your smile?	1	4
Well, I'm an actress, and I take some classes at Hunter.	1	4
Do you?	1	4
I would have thought you slept all day and bathed in milk.	1	4
How was it?	1	4
It was nice. Very quiet.	1	4
Oh. In case you're interested.	1	4
Oh. Thank you.	1	4
I'll be sure to look at it.	1	4
I can't thank you enough.	1	4
I hope I can return the favor sometime.	1	4
Oh, please, don't even think about it.	1	4
Looks pretty familiar.	1	4
Well, I wanted to maintain our original strategy,	1	4
but I think the wordplay achieves what you're looking for:	1	4
The idea that from the acorn...	1	4
that is, Bethlehem Steel...	1	4
comes America's great cities.	1	4
I know this isn't the idea you want to sell me,	1	4
so don't sell it so damn well.	1	4
Excuse me?	1	4
The backbone idea.	1	4
Campbell pitched it to me last night.	1	4
I like it.	1	4
What backbone idea?	1	4
Bethlehem Steel: The backbone of America.	1	4
Wasn't that it?	1	4
Oh, right.	1	4
It's concise, strong,	1	4
and frankly, I like that you were so enthusiastic about it	1	4
you couldn't wait to tell me.	1	4
Thanks again, boys.	1	4
Pleasure to make you happy, Walt.	1	4
Hope your visit to New York was productive.	1	4
I'm warming to the place.	1	4
Nice work.	1	4
I told you I had ideas.	1	4
Yes, you did.	1	4
Good one. Enjoy it.	1	4
You know what I think?	1	4
I think I did something good, and you got the compliment for it.	1	4
Listen, Pete,	1	4
I need you to go get a cardboard box...	1	4
and put your things in it.	1	4
Okay?	1	4
You picked the wrong time to buy an apartment.	1	4
H- How far has Mr. Adams gotten in the lesson?	1	4
B- Backing out?	1	4
Everybody out.	1	4
Now!	1	4
Uh, did he cover starting the car?	1	4
And the other way to stop.	1	4
Remember Pete Campbell's last day?	1	4
It's today.	1	4
What happened?	1	4
While I was breaking my neck trying to fix the hash he made yesterday,	1	4
he was at the St. Regis pitching copy.	1	4
His copy.	1	4
That little shit.	1	4
It was hard to see her all alone like that...	1	4
supporting herself with that sad little job at the jewelry store.	1	4
Frozen food.	1	4
I mean, I know she gets some kind of help,	1	4
but still, she looks so exhausted.	1	4
She tries to put on a brave face.	1	4
Honestly, I think she's jealous of me.	1	4
I've seen it before. I was in a sorority.	1	4
I mean, seeing happy families all around.	1	4
But I don't know what I can do.	1	4
I can't just disappear. I live there.	1	4
Of course, my real concern is those children.	1	4
I mean, the baby won't know the difference,	1	4
but that poor little boy.	1	4
The person taking care of him isn't giving him what he needs.	1	4
You know?	1	4
Gentlemen, please.	1	4
You really love that thing.	1	4
You were cute back then.	1	4
Pete Campbell.	1	4
On his way out.	1	4
Sorry to hear that.	1	4
Can't be avoided, I'm afraid.	1	4
I wish I could agree with that.	1	4
He's a junior account executive	1	4
who brought his own idea to a client in a bar.	1	4
There are rules.	1	4
There are other rules.	1	4
What's the problem?	1	4
New York City is a marvelous machine	1	4
filled with a mesh of levers and gears and springs,	1	4
like a fine watch wound tight.	1	4
Always ticking.	1	4
Sounds more like a bomb.	1	4
How much do you know about Pete's family?	1	4
Nothing, except they put out a mediocre product.	1	4
His mother is Dorothy Dykeman Campbell.	1	4
The Dykemans owned pretty much everything	1	4
north of 125th Street,	1	4
which I don't know how good your geography is,	1	4
but that's a fair chunk of the island.	1	4
So they're rich. So what?	1	4
Well, no.	1	4
Uh, his grandfather dropped it all in '29.	1	4
Panicked.	1	4
Some people have no confidence in this country.	1	4
What's your concern, then?	1	4
Well, I don't want Dorothy Dykeman Campbell	1	4
standing on the dock at Fisher's Island this summer	1	4
talking about how badly Sterling Cooper treated her son.	1	4
I don't think any of us want that.	1	4
We lose him,	1	4
we lose our entree to Buckley, DKE,	1	4
the Maidstone Club, the Century Club,	1	4
Dartmouth...	1	4
Gracie Mansion sometimes.	1	4
It's a marquee issue for us.	1	4
See my point?	1	4
Absolutely.	1	4
He's more valuable to the agency than I am.	1	4
Don't fool yourself.	1	4
There's a Pete Campbell at every agency out there.	1	4
Well, let's get one of the other ones.	1	4
You're going to need a stronger stomach	1	4
if you're going to be back in the kitchen seeing how the sausage is made.	1	4
Thought it was a big watch.	1	4
You handle the words.	1	4
You know how much we want you here with us.	1	4
No doubt about that.	1	4
Don's a big boy, Bert.	1	4
Aren't you, Don?	1	4
Well, thank you, sir.	1	4
There you go.	1	4
I'm glad we're all better now.	1	4
What you did is totally unacceptable.	1	4
I realize that.	1	4
I want you to be very clear about this.	1	4
You were fired. I wanted you out.	1	4
Cooper wanted you out.	1	4
And you would be if it weren't for this man.	1	4
He thought you deserved another chance.	1	4
That's right. He fought for you.	1	4
I don't know what to say.	1	4
Say nothing.	1	4
You're here because of Don Draper's largesse.	1	4
Thank you. Thank you so much.	1	4
Now, I know that your generation went to college instead of serving,	1	4
so I'll illuminate you:	1	4
This man is your commanding officer.	1	4
You live and die in his shadow.	1	4
Understood?	1	4
I won't let you down, Don.	1	4
Jesus, Campbell.	1	4
Don't ever say that.	1	4
I bet daily friendship with that bottle attracts more people to advertising	1	4
than any salary you can dream of.	1	4
It's why I got in.	1	4
So enjoy it.	1	4
I'm doing my best here.	1	4
Oh, you're not.	1	4
You don't know how to drink, your whole generation.	1	4
You drink for the wrong reasons.	1	4
My generation, we drink because it's good.	1	4
Because it feels better than unbuttoning your collar.	1	4
Because we deserve it.	1	4
We drink because it's what men do.	1	4
What about shaky hands?	1	4
I see a lot of that, too, with you boys.	1	4
No joke. Your kind with your gloomy thoughts and your worries,	1	4
you're all busy licking some imaginary wound.	1	4
Not all imaginary.	1	4
Yeah, boo-hoo.	1	4
Maybe I'm not as comfortable being powerless as you are.	1	4
Pardon?	1	4
You know, you shouldn't compete with Pete Campbell.	1	4
I'm not.	1	4
Yeah. You are.	1	4
Not at a personal level, but for the world.	1	4
I don't know.	1	4
Maybe every generation thinks the next one is the end of it all.	1	4
I bet there are people in the Bible	1	4
walking around complaining about kids today.	1	4
Kids today, they have no one to look up to...	1	4
because they're looking up to us.	1	4
Of course, if you're not going to have live-in help,	1	4
that back room can be used for any number of things.	1	4
I don't think we'll be having live-in help just yet, do you, sweetheart?	1	4
No, I think we'll be managing on our own for now.	1	4
Oh, I'm so glad you could come.	1	4
I'd like you to meet Mrs. Clifford Lyman.	1	4
She'll be one of your new neighbors,	1	4
and she's on the co-op board.	1	4
Of course you know these two.	1	4
Where's the nursery at?	1	4
Thank you, Tom.	1	4
I don't want to hear that again.	1	4
Mrs. Lyman, Trudy Campbell.	1	4
So nice to meet you.	1	4
Well, aren't you darling?	1	4
The two of you.	1	4
A pleasure.	1	4
Now, I know I shouldn't ask, but I have to.	1	4
Your mother-in-law was just telling me	1	4
that your great-great-grandfather was a farmer with Isaac Roosevelt?	1	4
Is that right?	1	4
Um, yes. That's true.	1	4
That was Nicholas Dykeman, right?	1	4
On his mother's side.	1	4
Can you imagine orchards on 204th Street?	1	4
He's buried at the Church of the Intercession.	1	4
Oh, my goodness. Wait until I tell my husband	1	4
there's going to be a Dykeman living in the building.	1	4
He'll be so thrilled.	1	4
Sweetheart, tell Mrs. Lyman the story about your great-great aunt	1	4
getting in that fight with the British soldier and the Hessian.	1	4
You tell it, dear.	1	4
You tell it so much better than I do.	1	4
Well, I think it was his great-great aunt,	1	4
or great-great-great... I'm not sure...	1	4
but it was before the Revolutionary War,	1	4
and the Dykemans owned a large tract of land	1	4
just north of Central Park.	1	4
Of course, it wasn't called Central Park back then, but...	1	4
This will look good in your office.	1	5
What, take that thing on the train, like some kid who won at the 4-H?	1	5
Besides, no one wants to look like they care about awards.	1	5
But you do.	1	5
Isn't that sad?	1	5
Roger was very eloquent.	1	5
He likes to be recognized for selling.	1	5
Creative is less important.	1	5
Creative helps sell.	1	5
But he gave the speech.	1	5
Look at you in this tuxedo.	1	5
 Say it for me.	1	5
Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Draper.	1	5
Enchanted.	1	5
Hey.	1	5
It's 8:00.	1	5
Shit.	1	5
Oh, my Lord.	1	5
Mommy, Mommy! Ethel's downstairs.	1	5
She's making us breakfast.	1	5
Sally, Mommy has a headache.	1	5
What's that thing?	1	5
Daddy's boss won an award.	1	5
Daddy won one, too.	1	5
An award for good horses?	1	5
 Go downstairs and eat something.	1	5
I think there's Alka-Seltzer in the kitchen.	1	5
Are you okay?	1	5
Yeah, just do it in the kitchen.	1	5
I don't want to hear the bubbles.	1	5
Congratulations, Mr. Draper.	1	5
Thank you.	1	5
I hear Advertising Age ran a picture.	1	5
Fortunately, no one reads that.	1	5
That's really amazing.	1	5
I'll get Mr. Campbell and Mr. Kinsey.	1	5
They wanted you to know they were waiting, but they left.	1	5
That's rude.	1	5
They said something about the Newkie Award going to your head.	1	5
Congratulations, by the way.	1	5
Thank you.	1	5
Congratulations to you, too.	1	5
Thank you, Peggy.	1	5
Congratulations for what, being the only one on time for this meeting?	1	5
Oh, I was just telling Peggy I got a short story published.	1	5
Good for you.	1	5
The Atlantic Monthly.	1	5
Look at that.	1	5
Congratulations.	1	5
Thank you.	1	5
What does that have to do with you, Kenny?	1	5
"""Tapping a Maple on a Cold Vermont Morning. """	1	5
Cosgrove here got a story published in The, uh... The Atlantic Monthly.	1	5
- Heavy. - You're kidding.	1	5
I look forward to reading it.	1	5
Keep it. I've got copies.	1	5
Congrats, indeed. A thing like that.	1	5
You're a writer. You write.	1	5
Well, yes.	1	5
The weird thing is short fiction is not my strong suit.	1	5
I have two novels.	1	5
Novels? About what?	1	5
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig	1	5
who has to move to Manhattan because his wife's mother is sick.	1	5
The other one is, well,	1	5
a woman who's a widow...	1	5
she kind of got stuck with this family farm.	1	5
No one will help her except this boy.	1	5
Those don't even sound stupid.	1	5
Thanks.	1	5
I mean, they both sound good.	1	5
- Want to read one? - I do.	1	5
But I also want to talk about Liberty Capital Savings.	1	5
Right.	1	5
Talk, one of you.	1	5
As you know, Jack Konig says they want a new promotion.	1	5
Interest rates are level.	1	5
Some kind of irresistible fireworks that bring people to the bank,	1	5
even if it's just to visit.	1	5
I hate it when they say fireworks.	1	5
Especially when they keep talking about a toaster	1	5
with a warming tray on top, or a blender.	1	5
A blender's nice.	1	5
Jack keeps talking about escalating the toaster wars	1	5
in order to lure women in,	1	5
which is silly when you think about it,	1	5
because other than a few working girls,	1	5
most women aren't in charge of the banking.	1	5
Not in my house.	1	5
They visit the bank.	1	5
They do.	1	5
All we do is try to get the girls in.	1	5
Families.	1	5
But you know what?	1	5
Men need their own accounts, beyond the family.	1	5
Men?	1	5
Oh, I can see that.	1	5
Discretion. Discretionary.	1	5
Statements sent to the office.	1	5
Yes.	1	5
Liberty Capital Private Account.	1	5
No.	1	5
Executive Account.	1	5
That's why he won an award.	1	5
Accounts won the award.	1	5
Yeah.	1	5
There's a call for you from Bix Beiderbecke.	1	5
Hello, Mr. Beiderbecke?	1	5
It's me, and don't ask who, or you'll spoil the mood.	1	5
Who's Bix?	1	5
The trumpeter.	1	5
I was thinking about playing the horn this afternoon.	1	5
Where are you calling me from?	1	5
I just had a phone put in.	1	5
Really. Instant connection,	1	5
just like that night at the ticket booth in Grand Central.	1	5
Midge, I'm at work.	1	5
Just get down here.	1	5
I want you to pull my hair and ravish me	1	5
and leave me for dead.	1	5
I'll be back after lunch.	1	5
Kenneth Cosgrove.	1	5
I think I'm going to vomit.	1	5
Who the hell is Ken Cosgrove?	1	5
He's from Burlington, Vermont.	1	5
His father is a salesman.	1	5
What does that have to do with it?	1	5
I can't believe he got published	1	5
and didn't tell anyone until it came out.	1	5
No, he kept walking around like the idiot he is.	1	5
I have this story about this crazy night I had	1	5
where I ended up in Jersey City with all these Negroes,	1	5
and we all got along.	1	5
Can you imagine how good that story is?	1	5
No.	1	5
It is.	1	5
It's a national magazine.	1	5
Yep.	1	5
That hurts, too.	1	5
That was it.	1	5
That's what I called for.	1	5
You can go.	1	5
You can't call me at work.	1	5
You scared of me getting lonely all the time?	1	5
Start having conversations with you	1	5
and ring you all the time,	1	5
"saying, ""When are you gonna come over?"""	1	5
This is working right now.	1	5
And it worked today.	1	5
Look, I'm sorry your life is in a million pieces.	1	5
Be easier for you to have one less.	1	5
I hurt your feelings.	1	5
You didn't like my call a little bit?	1	5
I'm here.	1	5
And you waited until you were done	1	5
to make me feel bad about the phone call.	1	5
I like that you come in here, acting like somebody else.	1	5
It must be so intense above 14th Street.	1	5
Then you shoot down on the train.	1	5
That look when I open that door.	1	5
Sometimes you're preoccupied,	1	5
but then you always...	1	5
well, you always...	1	5
change gears.	1	5
I don't even think about it.	1	5
I know.	1	5
I like being your medicine.	1	5
Okay.	1	5
What's wrong with it?	1	5
Just tell me. I can tell you don't like it.	1	5
Oh, I do.	1	5
And I love that you're sitting alone at your typewriter,	1	5
drinking a Scotch, thinking it up.	1	5
But you don't like it.	1	5
I mostly read the classics.	1	5
It seemed strange to me. It's too modern.	1	5
Really?	1	5
Uh, that's kind of a compliment.	1	5
But I don't think you mean it that way.	1	5
I just think it's odd that the bear is talking.	1	5
The bear is not talking.	1	5
It's what the hunter imagines the bear to be thinking.	1	5
Well, it's well-written.	1	5
Why don't you submit it?	1	5
I was going to when I finished dickering with it.	1	5
You could run it by Charlie Fiddich.	1	5
He has one of those big publishing jobs, doesn't he?	1	5
Your friend Laura kept saying how he makes things happen there.	1	5
Why would I do that?	1	5
Because he can help us.	1	5
Call him. Ask him to look at the story.	1	5
Why now?	1	5
Do you know who Ken Cosgrove is?	1	5
He's an account executive, just like me.	1	5
Did you know that?	1	5
My father reads the damn Atlantic.	1	5
So what?	1	5
You don't want to be a writer.	1	5
I thought it was a hobby.	1	5
He's out there. People know who he is.	1	5
Pumpkin, Charlie Fiddich?	1	5
I'm surprised.	1	5
You can tell what this means to me.	1	5
You said you'd do anything for me.	1	5
I don't understand you.	1	5
You were so upset when I told you.	1	5
Told me about what?	1	5
Peter.	1	5
Told me about what?	1	5
That he was my first.	1	5
Well...	1	5
this helps make up for that.	1	5
Let Charlie Fiddich...	1	5
see what he's been missing.	1	5
Okay.	1	5
- Good morning. - Oh, good morning.	1	5
Traffic meeting is starting in the conference room.	1	5
Really.	1	5
Cosgrove, I'm serious.	1	5
I think it shows tremendous fortitude,	1	5
and I'd like to see more of it around here:	1	5
People finishing things.	1	5
I guarantee you that in the bottom drawer of every desk in this place	1	5
- is the first ten pages of a novel. - Five.	1	5
The story itself was not much to my liking,	1	5
but I think it showed an uncanny understanding	1	5
of what most people like.	1	5
I guess so.	1	5
What did you get paid for that, a hundred bucks?	1	5
About that.	1	5
Well, that'll keep you working here.	1	5
So, Miss Holloway,	1	5
would you like to take the reins?	1	5
Let's start with Maytag. Mr. Cosgrove.	1	5
Do you want to complain about the copy,	1	5
now that you're a big writer?	1	5
Production needs 50% up front,	1	5
and we're waiting on a check.	1	5
And when will you be calling the client about that?	1	5
Well, I spoke with him last week,	1	5
and I'll check with him again this afternoon.	1	5
Aren't you good?	1	5
Rio de Janeiro.	1	5
The double-page spread we ran in Life and Town & Country	1	5
was so successful,	1	5
they want to resize the ad to run in Reader's Digest.	1	5
Big ad.	1	5
Little magazine.	1	5
Sal's problem.	1	5
Lucky Strike?	1	5
Don?	1	5
Sales are great. Lawsuit is pending.	1	5
You're the one who's supposed to keep an eye out	1	5
on what's happening in Washington.	1	5
After the election.	1	5
I'm sorry. Do you mind?	1	5
I'll take any excuse to get out of this meeting.	1	5
His name is Adam Whitman.	1	5
Tell him, uh...	1	5
Where is he?	1	5
Reception.	1	5
I should, uh... I have to deal with this.	1	5
Sure, sure.	1	5
You better come back, now.	1	5
- I got this. - Okay.	1	5
Can I help you?	1	5
Can I help you?	1	5
It's you.	1	5
It's really you.	1	5
Dick.	1	5
I can't believe it.	1	5
I don't know what you're talking about.	1	5
I know I'm grown up, but, Dick, it's me.	1	5
It's Adam.	1	5
Your little brother?	1	5
It's Don.	1	5
It says Donald Draper, but I knew it was you.	1	5
Are you upset? Are you mad at me?	1	5
I don't even know who you are.	1	5
I know I look different.	1	5
I grew up tall, okay?	1	5
But it's me, Dick.	1	5
Look, I'm a janitor at American Calculator in the Empire State Building,	1	5
and I found this is someone's trash.	1	5
I thought I saw a ghost.	1	5
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.	1	5
You can't even look at me.	1	5
Okay. You're at work.	1	5
I can come back another time.	1	5
No.	1	5
There's a coffee shop three blocks west of here.	1	5
Deelite.	1	5
I'll meet you there at noon.	1	5
That's swell.	1	5
And everything's all set for the Liberty Capital meeting?	1	5
Yes, of course, all set.	1	5
Well, thank you all.	1	5
I'm glad everybody can make it sound like they're working so hard.	1	5
I can't believe this.	1	5
It is really you.	1	5
What do you want from me?	1	5
I don't understand this.	1	5
You have nothing to say to me?	1	5
Nothing to ask me?	1	5
Dick, I thought you were dead, and you're right here.	1	5
That's not me.	1	5
Can't you even say my name?	1	5
Adam...	1	5
that's not me.	1	5
It is.	1	5
What happened to you?	1	5
Why did you do that?	1	5
Why did you leave me?	1	5
I couldn't go back there.	1	5
Nothing for me.	1	5
I knew you weren't dead.	1	5
I knew I saw you that day hiding in the window in your uniform.	1	5
I was only 8, but I knew it was you.	1	5
It was a long time ago.	1	5
I can't believe...	1	5
When I saw that picture in the paper,	1	5
"I thought, ""It looks exactly like him, except around the eyes. """	1	5
Donald Draper?	1	5
What kind of name is that?	1	5
What difference does it make?	1	5
People change their names.	1	5
Yeah, I guess.	1	5
What happened to her?	1	5
Mom?	1	5
She wasn't my mother.	1	5
She never let me forget that.	1	5
She's gone.	1	5
Stomach cancer.	1	5
Good.	1	5
Uncle Mack took it pretty hard.	1	5
He passed, too.	1	5
Are you sure you don't want anything?	1	5
I know. I've got this lump in my throat.	1	5
I'd love to eat right now, but I can't.	1	5
Did you miss me at all?	1	5
Of course I did.	1	5
It's good to see you.	1	5
You look well.	1	5
Would have rather had lunch with you.	1	5
I know. But I have an appointment	1	5
with the decorator for our new apartment.	1	5
Another time, I promise.	1	5
You said you enjoyed the story.	1	5
Yes, I did.	1	5
As much as anyone can enjoy that kind of thing.	1	5
So you like it, or you didn't like it?	1	5
It doesn't matter.	1	5
It matters that I publish it, right?	1	5
Yes. It does.	1	5
Have you been seeing Laura still?	1	5
Yes.	1	5
She's terrific.	1	5
Fun.	1	5
She really is.	1	5
Trudy, I want to talk to you	1	5
about something that has nothing to do with this.	1	5
Okay.	1	5
I miss you.	1	5
I miss being with you.	1	5
That's very sweet to hear.	1	5
I know you're married.	1	5
It doesn't have to be more than just being with you.	1	5
I can't.	1	5
Charlie, I...	1	5
No. I can't. I'm a newlywed.	1	5
Maybe... like in some movie,	1	5
sometime in the future, when we're old.	1	5
Maybe then.	1	5
I want you now. I don't want you old.	1	5
I want you now.	1	5
I know you'll never leave him.	1	5
I can keep a secret.	1	5
No, Charlie.	1	5
Please.	1	5
Sally, don't run.	1	5
Okay!	1	5
Hello.	1	5
Hello.	1	5
My goodness, you're Mrs. Draper, aren't you?	1	5
Hello. You must be Peggy.	1	5
I recognized your voice.	1	5
So nice to finally meet you in person.	1	5
This is Sally and Robert.	1	5
We're here for our portrait.	1	5
Of course.	1	5
I guess I knew that.	1	5
Is he in there?	1	5
Um, not right now, but please go inside.	1	5
I'll be right back.	1	5
Joan?	1	5
Oh, my God, Joan, I need your help.	1	5
Let go of me.	1	5
Mrs. Draper is here,	1	5
and they're having their portrait taken,	1	5
and he snuck out, and I don't know who to lie to.	1	5
Calm down. Just breathe slowly.	1	5
Mr. Draper is out,	1	5
and I don't think I'm supposed to know where he went.	1	5
- That happens. - But they're taking their pictures today,	1	5
and I would have reminded him,	1	5
but he slipped out before I could.	1	5
It's his fault. He comes and goes and never says anything.	1	5
Where is he?	1	5
I make an excuse to Mrs. Draper, she could catch him in it,	1	5
especially if she just leaves.	1	5
Or even worse, then he'll know	1	5
that I know where he was.	1	5
Where is he?	1	5
I don't know.	1	5
You do know,	1	5
and you're going to tell me,	1	5
or I'm not going to tell you what to do.	1	5
- I can't believe you. - Well?	1	5
He sees this woman.	1	5
He saw her the other day.	1	5
He came back all greasy and calm.	1	5
No.	1	5
Oh, God. Now I've told you.	1	5
I'm the worst secretary in the world.	1	5
- Who is she? - I don't care. Please hurry.	1	5
Peggy, use your noodle.	1	5
You're making this so complicated.	1	5
You go out there, and you entertain her and her brats.	1	5
Get some Hershey bars from the cart	1	5
and tell her you don't know where he is and you forgot to remind him.	1	5
It is the truth. And when he comes back, let him have an excuse.	1	5
He'll have one.	1	5
And then you just start apologizing	1	5
for, well...	1	5
just how stupid you are.	1	5
It's probably what I would have done anyway.	1	5
Oh, God, now I really shouldn't have told you.	1	5
You shouldn't have told me.	1	5
I'm not gonna tell anybody,	1	5
but you shouldn't have told anybody that.	1	5
This isn't how I imagined it.	1	5
I'm sorry.	1	5
You keep saying you're sorry.	1	5
Where were you all this time?	1	5
Around. Here, mostly.	1	5
I'm not mad at you.	1	5
I just want to know.	1	5
I mean, look at you.	1	5
Who is Donald Draper?	1	5
I mean, do you have a wife?	1	5
Kids?	1	5
I'm going to go.	1	5
That's it?	1	5
Want me to pay for lunch?	1	5
- No. - Let me.	1	5
You didn't have anything.	1	5
I don't understand why you're being like this.	1	5
When I was little,	1	5
I used to imagine this day happening, and here it is.	1	5
I don't understand. I'm family.	1	5
I just want to be a part of your life.	1	5
Adam, that's not going to happen.	1	5
I'm going to walk out that door.	1	5
That's it.	1	5
I'm not buying your lunch...	1	5
because this never happened.	1	5
I don't like black licorice, either.	1	5
Are you sure we should wait?	1	5
I think so.	1	5
I can't believe I forgot.	1	5
Oh, are you missing your lunch?	1	5
No. It's okay. I brought it.	1	5
Well, you'll probably be going out tonight.	1	5
Might as well take it easy.	1	5
That's true.	1	5
Do you have a boyfriend or a steady?	1	5
Um, no.	1	5
I work a lot.	1	5
Some blind dates.	1	5
I remember those.	1	5
- The disappointments. - Yeah.	1	5
Mr. Draper's office.	1	5
How's it going?	1	5
No, thank you. I'm staying in.	1	5
- Mr. Draper treating you well? - Yes.	1	5
He's been very patient	1	5
while I've been learning the ropes around here.	1	5
Don't you just hate it when his mouth runs on and on?	1	5
Excuse me?	1	5
I'm joking.	1	5
You probably know more about him than I do.	1	5
You look so beautiful in that light.	1	5
You should take the picture right there.	1	5
Well, I... I did want to look good.	1	5
Mr. Draper. I'm...	1	5
The portrait.	1	5
What happened? Where were you?	1	5
We were just about to leave.	1	5
I'm so embarrassed. I forgot to remind you.	1	5
No, I forgot to check in before I went to the printer.	1	5
I'm such a fool. I don't know where my head is.	1	5
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Draper.	1	5
- Please forgive me. - No, it's nothing.	1	5
All we need are some wet paper towels to get the chocolate off	1	5
before we go in front of the lens.	1	5
We'll have to do that on the way.	1	5
They must be waiting for us at the studio.	1	5
Come on.	1	5
Nice to meet you.	1	5
Don't worry about it.	1	5
Thank you.	1	5
They're terrible.	1	5
No, they're not.	1	5
Don was late.	1	5
It ruins the whole thing.	1	5
Oh, Carlton's always late.	1	5
You can see what's important to them.	1	5
We're very important to them. Stop it.	1	5
How'd you like to be in Helen Bishop's family portrait?	1	5
There's a big hole there, believe me.	1	5
I want to take them again anyway.	1	5
Sally looks fat.	1	5
I don't think so.	1	5
The worst part is, Don will think they're fine.	1	5
Here. Maybe this one.	1	5
Blow that one up.	1	5
It'll hold you until the Christmas card.	1	5
The color is off on these, too.	1	5
Am I wrong?	1	5
I really expect the royal treatment when I go to Don's office,	1	5
and I seldom get it.	1	5
It's like walking into another country where I don't speak the language.	1	5
At Carlton's, I feel like I'm stupid.	1	5
All that Manhattan talk.	1	5
Our husbands.	1	5
They are better out here, aren't they?	1	5
Infinitely.	1	5
We took your idea of product and applied it directly to the bank.	1	5
Banking products, not household products.	1	5
You said banking products weren't sexy.	1	5
We went down some really dumb roads,	1	5
like bank accounts for children,	1	5
and then Don, here,	1	5
had this Roman candle of an idea.	1	5
Don?	1	5
I think Paul has a handle on this.	1	5
The modern executive is a busy man.	1	5
He leads a complicated life.	1	5
He has business expenses, family, leisure.	1	5
How are you supposed to keep all that straight?	1	5
Well, now Liberty Capital is going to help you with that.	1	5
Okay.	1	5
What is this?	1	5
An account for a man that is private.	1	5
The statements come to the office, not your home.	1	5
I see. For organizing your life.	1	5
If it needs it.	1	5
Liberty for the libertine.	1	5
That's good.	1	5
Does this say that to you?	1	5
"It will if you put the word ""private"" in there instead of ""liberty. """	1	5
Executive Private Account.	1	5
What are you laughing at?	1	5
A portion of our customers are already, I believe, doing this.	1	5
There's just no name for it,	1	5
and we had no way to charge them.	1	5
I like the torch.	1	5
It says, don't get burned.	1	5
It could start some uncomfortable conversations	1	5
in a lot of homes, but, uh...	1	5
it's better than a calendar.	1	5
Let's talk placement.	1	5
Hello.	1	5
I opened everything but that one.	1	5
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig	1	5
who has to move to Manhattan because his wife's mother is sick.	1	5
The other is about...	1	5
You know, I just finished reading it.	1	5
It's really a great story.	1	5
Thank you. That means a lot.	1	5
It's nice to see someone's passion be rewarded.	1	5
You know what?	1	5
I don't have a copy of it,	1	5
and I wanted to give it to my girlfriend.	1	5
Hey!	1	5
You said you got, like, 50 more copies, right?	1	5
Maybe I do.	1	5
If not, it's on every newsstand in town.	1	5
Good to hear.	1	5
You're leaving?	1	5
Yes. For the day.	1	5
Oh, okay.	1	5
I'm going home.	1	5
You can reach me there if necessary.	1	5
I've always wondered why he's ignored me.	1	5
Probably because he's so good-looking	1	5
he can go outside the office for whatever he wants.	1	5
Most of these fellas can't.	1	5
He seemed different to me.	1	5
Well, either way, you have to do your job.	1	5
Keep his record clean here and at home.	1	5
Honestly, if he sees that in you, you are solid gold.	1	5
That's my job?	1	5
Yes.	1	5
That's his private life.	1	5
Private.	1	5
That's how these men are.	1	5
And it's why we love them.	1	5
I don't love him.	1	5
Fine.	1	5
Look, if you're even thinking about passing judgment,	1	5
then you're in the wrong business.	1	5
Okay.	1	5
You need to relax.	1	5
I have never come over here	1	5
"and not seen you with a look on your face that said ""I need a drink. """	1	5
This job is odd.	1	5
But it's the best.	1	5
Listen, Kenny.	1	5
What?	1	5
Listen, I know I've been a bear,	1	5
but I've been competing neck and neck with people in this place.	1	5
I didn't know I was competing with you, too.	1	5
You lost.	1	5
Hello, sweetheart.	1	5
Hello, dear.	1	5
Well... I have some good news.	1	5
Charlie Fiddich came by the house this afternoon.	1	5
Did he? Here?	1	5
I guess your lunch did go well.	1	5
It wasn't lunch. I told you that.	1	5
So what did he say? Don't tease me.	1	5
He said he was going to get you published.	1	5
That is incredibly swell news.	1	5
When? Where?	1	5
Boys' Life magazine.	1	5
What?	1	5
It's a $40 fee,	1	5
and a lot of people read it.	1	5
Are you kidding me? Boys' Life?	1	5
That story was good enough for The New Yorker.	1	5
And don't act like those magazines do everything on merit.	1	5
I thought you'd be happy.	1	5
For a year's work.	1	5
You don't want me to have what I want.	1	5
You're going to be published.	1	5
Boys' Life.	1	5
Probably next to some ad for exploding cigars.	1	5
I could have gotten you in The New Yorker	1	5
or in the Encyclopedia Britannica	1	5
if I wanted to.	1	5
So...	1	5
why didn't you?	1	5
Why would you do that to me?	1	5
Why would you put me in that position?	1	5
I talked to my father about the house in Cape May.	1	5
He said our dates are good.	1	5
August won't be a problem.	1	5
That's good.	1	5
I wish it wasn't so far from the city.	1	5
Then we'd see more of you.	1	5
It's not that far.	1	5
Well, I hate you spending August in the office.	1	5
Although I liked your girl Peggy.	1	5
She's fresh.	1	5
As the driven snow.	1	5
You sound disappointed.	1	5
Did you read some terrible article in Look magazine	1	5
that I should know about?	1	5
I like her.	1	5
A woman can't just not remark on her husband's secretary.	1	5
Don, are you okay?	1	5
No, I just might have to go back to the office.	1	5
I haven't decided yet.	1	5
Phone!	1	5
Hello.	1	5
I need to see you tonight. Are you busy?	1	5
For you? Of course not.	1	5
Good. I'm leaving now.	1	5
From where?	1	5
25 minutes.	1	5
I don't even know what you drink.	1	5
Whatever you have.	1	5
I'm so glad you changed your mind.	1	5
Come in.	1	5
Sit down.	1	5
I know it's terrible.	1	5
It's temporary, I... I hope.	1	5
Look at you.	1	5
You look more like you now.	1	5
I came here because I wanted to talk to you	1	5
and explain something to you.	1	5
You got to stop that kind of talk.	1	5
This isn't so hard.	1	5
Adam, listen to me.	1	5
I have a life,	1	5
and it only goes in one direction:	1	5
Forward.	1	5
What are you drinking?	1	5
Gin?	1	5
I found it in one of the offices, under a couch.	1	5
Three quarts.	1	5
I figured I could take one.	1	5
Coffee.	1	5
I can do that.	1	5
So no Abigail, no Uncle Mack.	1	5
Nobody, huh?	1	5
I know. It's strange.	1	5
Your office is really nice.	1	5
I figure from that award you must be pretty important.	1	5
I don't know. I guess so.	1	5
Well, everyone always said you were too smart for your own good.	1	5
Of course, Uncle Mack thought you were soft.	1	5
But you're not, are you?	1	5
No, I'm not.	1	5
What are you doing?	1	5
That's $5,000.	1	5
That's all there is.	1	5
I want you to take it, and I want you to leave New York,	1	5
and I don't want to see or hear from you ever again.	1	5
That's not what I wanted.	1	5
That's not right.	1	5
That's all I can do for you.	1	5
You're serious, aren't you?	1	5
You thought I was dead.	1	5
Just go back to thinking that.	1	5
Where do I go?	1	5
Adam, it is $5,000.	1	5
Make your own life.	1	5
I have too much here.	1	5
It's going to be okay.	1	5
How'd it go?	1	5
Crisis averted?	1	5
Yes. Papers were on my desk.	1	5
Do you want to go visit the kids?	1	5
No, I just want to go to sleep.	1	5
I want to talk to you about something,	1	5
and I don't want you to get upset.	1	5
I won't.	1	5
I know you hate going to my family's house in Cape May,	1	5
and I know even though my father...	1	5
No, it's great. It's great.	1	5
I'm looking forward to it already, I swear.	1	5
But I know you don't like that my father might be there for part of it.	1	5
I just don't like the way he looks at me.	1	5
You took away his little girl.	1	5
I was thinking maybe we should just buy a summer house.	1	5
Something closer that's ours.	1	5
I know we had a good year.	1	5
I don't know, Bets.	1	5
I think Cape May will be fine.	1	5
We're not that flush right now.	1	5
There's nothing to be worried about.	1	5
I'd just rather wait till next year.	1	5
Good.	1	5
Because I like seeing my dad.	1	5
Dick Whitman, you watch where you're going.	1	6
You're going to break your neck.	1	6
You going to cry or get up?	1	6
I'm getting up, Uncle Mack.	1	6
Good. There's someone who wants to meet you.	1	6
What are you afraid of?	1	6
There was lots of screaming.	1	6
Always is.	1	6
The Lord has given us a blessing.	1	6
You have a new brother.	1	6
He ain't my brother.	1	6
 Of course he is. You got the same daddy.	1	6
Isn't he beautiful?	1	6
I named him Adam after the first man.	1	6
Daddy!	1	6
Don, are you all right?	1	6
Happy Mother's Day.	1	6
This is fascinating.	1	6
It's better than the Hollywood version.	1	6
It's certainly dirtier.	1	6
Well, Joan Crawford is not what she was.	1	6
You know, honestly,	1	6
I found her eyebrows completely unnerving,	1	6
like a couple of...	1	6
caterpillars just pasted there.	1	6
 Her standing next to Suzy Parker as if they were the same species.	1	6
Well, some men like eyebrows,	1	6
and all men like Joan Crawford.	1	6
Salvatore couldn't stop talking about her.	1	6
To think, one of the great beauties, and there she is, so old.	1	6
I'd just like to disappear at that point.	1	6
It makes perfect sense.	1	6
I promise you, Bets,	1	6
the first sign of crow's feet, and I'll put you on an ice floe.	1	6
Or would you prefer to be my gal in the iron mask?	1	6
Did you have a nice Mother's Day?	1	6
It was lovely.	1	6
My mother was at least two years older than whatever Joan Crawford says she is,	1	6
and she was still very fetching.	1	6
I'd like to think that she'd stand up very well	1	6
as a prediction of my eventual appearance.	1	6
Bets, don't.	1	6
No melancholy.	1	6
I'm allowed to be sentimental on Mother's Day.	1	6
But it's your Mother's Day, not hers.	1	6
I'm just saying that my mother looked handsome.	1	6
Actually, vivacious and positively cheerful,	1	6
right up to her end.	1	6
It's good remembrance.	1	6
Dr. Wayne suggested a book which...	1	6
says that it's part of the mourning process.	1	6
Dr. Wayne.	1	6
I do think it's helping.	1	6
So you're cured?	1	6
I don't know how they tell that.	1	6
When their vacation house is paid for.	1	6
Don't deride him.	1	6
Mourning is just extended self-pity.	1	6
In New Guinea,	1	6
pygmies grind up their ancestors and drink the powder in a beer.	1	6
And a model culture at that, pygmies.	1	6
Did you know Michelangelo was painting the Sistine ceiling	1	6
when those people were still living in caves discovering fire?	1	6
I didn't know that.	1	6
Well, it's true.	1	6
Introduction to Basic Anthropology.	1	6
What about...	1	6
Advanced Reproduction?	1	6
How are your studies progressing in that?	1	6
Completed.	1	6
I got an A, actually.	1	6
You did?	1	6
Yep, I did.	1	6
I flunked the whole thing.	1	6
Well, that's because you got caught cheating.	1	6
Get the light.	1	6
I want you so much.	1	6
I thought about it all day.	1	6
Me, too.	1	6
No, I mean it.	1	6
It's all I think about...	1	6
every day.	1	6
Your car coming down the driveway.	1	6
I put the kids to bed early.	1	6
I make a grocery list. I cook butterscotch pudding.	1	6
I never let my hands idle.	1	6
Brushing my hair,	1	6
drinking my milk...	1	6
and it's all in a kind of fog	1	6
because I can't stop thinking about this.	1	6
I want you so badly.	1	6
You have me.	1	6
You do.	1	6
Ah, Don.	1	6
You remember Nick Rodis from Olympic Cruise Lines.	1	6
Nick, did you ever add that second deck of portholes?	1	6
Yes, but those rooms get pretty wet.	1	6
This is Urine Ben Shulhai from The Israel Ministry of Tourism.	1	6
"It is pronounced ""Yoram. """	1	6
Of course.	1	6
And this young lady is Lily Meyer.	1	6
Pleasure to meet you.	1	6
And you.	1	6
Caviar, blinis, mai tais.	1	6
We're thinking of a land of exotic luxury.	1	6
We'd like to think that if Beirut is the Paris of the Middle East,	1	6
Haifa can be the Rome.	1	6
It's an exciting idea.	1	6
Of course we should keep in mind	1	6
that Paris has the Eiffel Tower and Rome has the Coliseum.	1	6
And Tel Avenue is about to have a Hilton.	1	6
Olympic is charting our most luxurious liner	1	6
all along the wondrous ports of the Israeli Riviera.	1	6
We are going to visit Mr. Bernbach down the street,	1	6
but some of us find his humor to be kitsch.	1	6
We thought we would try a traditional way as well.	1	6
Sterling Cooper doesn't like to think of itself as traditional.	1	6
Maybe that is the wrong word. My English is not so good.	1	6
Glamour, like glamorous... that's the word.	1	6
We saw your awards.	1	6
We were impressed with your work on Rio de Janeiro.	1	6
You're not thinking of putting	1	6
a 150-foot statue of Jesus in Tel Aviv, are you?	1	6
Because that's how we sold Rio.	1	6
This book has been on the best-seller list	1	6
for two years in the States,	1	6
and is soon to be a major motion picture starring Paul Newman.	1	6
America has a love affair with Israel,	1	6
and we would like to bring the two parties together.	1	6
Well, you certainly saved me some legwork.	1	6
All I have is the Bible.	1	6
Let's stay away from that.	1	6
So, your ideal tourist.	1	6
What's his yearly salary?	1	6
Whatever you make.	1	6
They always say that.	1	6
Well, look who's here: A couple of angels.	1	6
Do we have lunch today?	1	6
No, darling, we're going to get Margaret a haircut.	1	6
A haircut?	1	6
Oh, I like your ponytail, squirt.	1	6
It makes you look young.	1	6
I like your hair, Daddy. It makes you look old.	1	6
We just have to find the right place.	1	6
Ginger?	1	6
I cut my own hair.	1	6
You picked her.	1	6
Don't you two make a handsome couple.	1	6
Honestly, I don't go for handsome.	1	6
Mona, Margaret.	1	6
What brings you below 59th Street?	1	6
Margaret, say hello.	1	6
Hello, Mr. Draper.	1	6
Oh, Mona, aren't you lucky?	1	6
Mother and daughter on the town.	1	6
Where are the girls getting their hair done these days?	1	6
By girls, you mean Brigitte Bardot?	1	6
Because that's what I'm seeing.	1	6
As long as she can pin a hat on it for church.	1	6
You are going to love this man.	1	6
I will make you an appointment. Come on.	1	6
Bye, Don.	1	6
Roger, sweetheart.	1	6
She used to love being in my office.	1	6
Her haircut is the least of Margaret's problems.	1	6
She's dated what, two boys?	1	6
One of them joined the service, the other one committed suicide.	1	6
She doesn't want to go to college.	1	6
Doesn't want to work.	1	6
Not interested in charity.	1	6
I don't know what we did wrong.	1	6
We gave her everything she wanted, and she's still useless.	1	6
You're being too hard on her.	1	6
She's a young girl.	1	6
When I was her age, I rode a tramp steamer	1	6
from Bar Harbor to Hilton Head.	1	6
I bet it was a yacht.	1	6
Someone still has to sail those things.	1	6
I think Margaret reminds you of you.	1	6
You're both spoiled.	1	6
Zip.	1	6
Come back to bed.	1	6
We can stay here all afternoon.	1	6
You don't have to go back to work.	1	6
I do. Zip.	1	6
You like the pearl necklace I gave you?	1	6
It's gorgeous.	1	6
Aren't you even going to have any of this?	1	6
Look, we've got Oysters Rockefeller, Beef Wellington, Napoleons.	1	6
If we leave this lunch alone, it'll take over Europe.	1	6
I don't like eating in here.	1	6
Food that close to the bed reminds me of a hospital.	1	6
If you had your own apartment, we could go to your place.	1	6
You could cook for me.	1	6
Don't you like things the way they are?	1	6
Are you kidding?	1	6
This has been the best year of my life.	1	6
Do you have any idea	1	6
how unhappy I was before I met you?	1	6
I was thinking of leaving my wife.	1	6
I'm just getting tired of all the... sneaking around.	1	6
Aren't you?	1	6
Roger, I know as much about men as you know about advertising,	1	6
and I know that the sneaking around is your favorite part.	1	6
You know, I have a lot of favorite parts.	1	6
I'd like to get you...	1	6
a little fourth floor walk-up somewhere	1	6
with no doors, no windows,	1	6
and lock you up for a week.	1	6
That's tempting.	1	6
But I like hotels.	1	6
You leave with what you came in with.	1	6
And little soaps. I love those.	1	6
I wish I knew what you wanted, Joanie.	1	6
I love this, Roger,	1	6
but a week is a considerable length of time, and I have my own world.	1	6
I go out, and I have parties, and I have friends over...	1	6
Male friends?	1	6
Yes.	1	6
I don't want to hear this.	1	6
Carol and I have this nice little rotation.	1	6
Carol. The disaster.	1	6
I've known Carol since college,	1	6
and she's been a good friend,	1	6
and she's bright, and she's neat.	1	6
So you think you'd be lonely.	1	6
I think it would be half as much fun alone.	1	6
You could get a bird.	1	6
They're fairly neat for animals.	1	6
Roger, if you had your way,	1	6
I would be stranded in some paperweight	1	6
with my legs stuck in the air.	1	6
Wait, wait, wait.	1	6
You're just gonna paint that picture and go, huh?	1	6
Can't we... just enjoy this?	1	6
I mean, we both know I'll eventually find a more permanent situation,	1	6
and you'll find a new model.	1	6
The '61s are coming out soon.	1	6
I hear the fins are bigger next year.	1	6
Whatever you want, Red.	1	6
I see why they want the guns.	1	6
It's tough to compete	1	6
with Bermuda only three hours away.	1	6
It helps if they stop blowing up hotels.	1	6
Oh, kill me, you busty Jewess.	1	6
Maybe we should try and exploit the danger instead of fighting it.	1	6
Travel as adventure.	1	6
Or how about this?	1	6
Average American family of three standing on shore, suitcases in hand.	1	6
The Red Sea parts before them.	1	6
On the other side waits a gleaming four-star resort.	1	6
Shouldn't you see the Promised Land?	1	6
Take religion out.	1	6
They've got plenty of Stations of the Cross traffic.	1	6
I've skimmed this research, and the whole thing's pretty red.	1	6
These communes, kibbutzes.	1	6
It's positively Soviet.	1	6
Except the Daughters of the American Revolution	1	6
are shuttling this book up and down Fifth Avenue.	1	6
It's a good story.	1	6
They start in these prison camps.	1	6
Like, real prisoners.	1	6
Then the next thing you know, they're in the desert, armed to the teeth,	1	6
cutting their way through the enemy, dying for the cause.	1	6
And then they have a government.	1	6
A commie government.	1	6
Made my mother cry.	1	6
So, we have a quasi-communist state where women have guns,	1	6
and it's filled with Jews.	1	6
Well, not completely filled.	1	6
Let's not forget that there are also Arabs.	1	6
They've got oranges.	1	6
As far as I can see,	1	6
the biggest thing this place has going for it:	1	6
The people are good-looking.	1	6
The Jews there don't look like the Jews here.	1	6
Have you been to the Diamond District?	1	6
All right. I have to make a couple phone calls.	1	6
Let's pick this up later.	1	6
Peggy, will you get me a private line, please?	1	6
Right away, Mr. Draper.	1	6
Donald Draper, Line 2.	1	6
I debated not taking the call.	1	6
I'm glad you did. I need to see you.	1	6
I don't think that's a good idea.	1	6
It's business.	1	6
Meet me for a drink.	1	6
I'm busy this evening.	1	6
I wouldn't have called if it wasn't important.	1	6
I should still be able to talk to you.	1	6
Give me credit for that.	1	6
Lunch. Tomorrow.	1	6
Lunch.	1	6
The Tea Room at The Pierre, 12:15.	1	6
Message received.	1	6
Oh, it's so muggy tonight.	1	6
Did you just get a library card?	1	6
I rarely see you read anything	1	6
that doesn't have a manila folder wrapped around it.	1	6
You should clean the gutters.	1	6
This weekend.	1	6
Is that good?	1	6
There's less action than I thought.	1	6
I thought it was a romance.	1	6
You know, the first boy I ever kissed was Jewish.	1	6
How did that happen?	1	6
My friend Deirdre Shaw was friends with a Jewish girl,	1	6
Beth... Gold, Silver, or something.	1	6
Beth invited us to a mixer at her synagogue in Lower Merion.	1	6
I'm surprised your mother let you go.	1	6
Well, it was a fundraiser for charity.	1	6
Those poor skinny people in the boats.	1	6
This boy danced with me all evening.	1	6
David Rosenberg.	1	6
He was very good-looking,	1	6
but there was something about him that was gloomy.	1	6
Was he a good kisser?	1	6
Let's just say he had more practice than I did.	1	6
Yeah, I'm sure he was very disappointed.	1	6
Oh, please. The only reason he picked me	1	6
is because I wasn't part of the synagogue.	1	6
In fact, the next day, on the school bus,	1	6
Beth told everyone I was necking with David Rosenberg.	1	6
The looks they gave me.	1	6
They were all blondes by the next summer.	1	6
Honey, it's hot.	1	6
And I have to read this book about the desert.	1	6
Of course.	1	6
Go ahead.	1	6
We should get an air conditioner up here.	1	6
We'll see.	1	6
Hiya, fellas. Come on in.	1	6
Did you see this?	1	6
Someone broke into the Yankees' equipment locker	1	6
in Cleveland yesterday.	1	6
Swiped Mickey Mantle's pet glove.	1	6
Huh. They should have taken his bat.	1	6
Shall we wait for you to have your breakfast?	1	6
A day without orange juice is a hell of a long day.	1	6
Hey, look, Ma, no hands.	1	6
"""Belle Jolie""?"	1	6
Yeah, I've been looking at the work of our esteemed predecessors.	1	6
I'm not heartened.	1	6
They make more colors of lipstick	1	6
than Howard Johnson has ice cream flavors,	1	6
but their sales are in the crapper.	1	6
These names.	1	6
Passion Flower Peach,	1	6
Tropical Boudoir Red.	1	6
And look, Ethel Rosenberg Pink.	1	6
Wear it to the chair.	1	6
Did you know that lipstick was invented	1	6
to simulate the flush on a woman's face after you treated her right?	1	6
If you're going to quote the research report,	1	6
"don't start with ""Did you know?"""	1	6
Research, I'm stumped.	1	6
I'll be honest. I don't speak Moron.	1	6
Do either of you speak Moron?	1	6
Let's throw it to the chickens.	1	6
Okay, girls, come on in.	1	6
Come on in, ladies. Gather around.	1	6
Settle down.	1	6
What, no lunch?	1	6
No, dear. This is better.	1	6
Belle Jolie wants us to tell them	1	6
what we think about their new line of lipsticks.	1	6
One-way glass.	1	6
That name seem weird to you?	1	6
Should be two-way glass, right?	1	6
I don't care what they call it.	1	6
Beats the hell out of X-ray Specs.	1	6
It's called brainstorming.	1	6
That sounds intimidating.	1	6
Is it like a test?	1	6
There are no wrong answers.	1	6
You just be your pretty little selves.	1	6
Grab a lipstick, grab a mirror, and sit down.	1	6
Oh, this one's too red for me.	1	6
And remember, the mirror could be your best friend	1	6
or your worst enemy.	1	6
Has no taste.	1	6
Ugly dress.	1	6
Horrible wig.	1	6
They're brainstorming.	1	6
I wouldn't expect more than a few sprinkles.	1	6
I love it when they do that.	1	6
My little blowfish.	1	6
Anybody mind if I take off my pants?	1	6
The red one's for me.	1	6
How many lipsticks do you own?	1	6
Gee, I don't know.	1	6
I'd have to go home and count.	1	6
Do you match your lip color to your clothing or to your accessories?	1	6
I know. That seems like a loaded question.	1	6
It is unloaded,	1	6
and I insist you curb your editorial comments.	1	6
Sometimes I match it to my nail polish.	1	6
Good answer. Go ahead.	1	6
Do you change your lip color with the seasons?	1	6
You, stand over there.	1	6
At what point do we start running electricity through the chairs?	1	6
You should have put a man in there so they'd take it seriously.	1	6
Good.	1	6
I was afraid I'd missed it.	1	6
I want to stand and salute that.	1	6
What's with Mouse Ears over there?	1	6
Thanks for coming.	1	6
Can I get you anything?	1	6
No.	1	6
How've you been?	1	6
Fine.	1	6
Tired.	1	6
It doesn't show.	1	6
I'm in the middle of spring inventory.	1	6
I hope you're not going to tell me	1	6
that the grand plan for remaking our store has a hitch in it.	1	6
You look beautiful.	1	6
I thought you had urgent business to discuss.	1	6
Anything for the lady?	1	6
Nothing for me... Mmm, coffee.	1	6
Irish coffee?	1	6
Coffee.	1	6
Yes, sir.	1	6
Business?	1	6
It turns out Israel Tourism is considering becoming a client,	1	6
and I'm having a hard time getting a handle on it.	1	6
And I'm the only Jew you know in New York City?	1	6
You're my favorite.	1	6
Jesus, Don, crack a book once in a while.	1	6
I have.	1	6
It's all sentimental World War II trivia,	1	6
oranges, kids in blue and white hats.	1	6
They're doing a movie of Exodus with Paul Newman.	1	6
Paul Newman? That's nice.	1	6
Now I have two reasons to see it.	1	6
Damn it.	1	6
You're usually so put together.	1	6
Thank you.	1	6
I'll say one thing about Israelis.	1	6
Don't cross them.	1	6
Well, those people at the meeting were definitely Zionists.	1	6
Zion just means Israel.	1	6
It's a very old name.	1	6
I'm sorry. I'm not an expert on this,	1	6
and something feels strange about being treated like one.	1	6
I just want to know something about it	1	6
that doesn't come from some ministry of propaganda.	1	6
Well, here's some more World War II trivia.	1	6
They just arrested Adolf Eichmann in Argentina last week.	1	6
Have you seen his resume?	1	6
Okay, I deserved that.	1	6
But I'm talking about tourists going to Israel.	1	6
I don't know what I can say.	1	6
I'm American. I'm really not very Jewish.	1	6
If my mother hadn't died having me,	1	6
I could have been Marilyn instead of Rachel.	1	6
No one would know the difference.	1	6
What is the difference?	1	6
Look, Jews have lived in exile for a long time:	1	6
First in Babylon,	1	6
then all over the world... Shanghai, Brooklyn...	1	6
and we've managed to make a go of it.	1	6
Maybe it has something to do	1	6
with the fact that we thrive at doing business	1	6
with people who hate us.	1	6
I don't hate you.	1	6
No. Individuals are wonderful.	1	6
That's not what I meant.	1	6
I don't know.	1	6
A country...	1	6
"for ""those people,"" as you call us,"	1	6
well...	1	6
it seems very important.	1	6
Then why aren't you there?	1	6
My life is here.	1	6
My grandfather came from Russia,	1	6
now we have a store on Fifth Avenue.	1	6
I'll visit, but I don't have to live there.	1	6
It just... has to be.	1	6
For me, it's more of an idea than a place.	1	6
Utopia.	1	6
Maybe.	1	6
They taught us at Barnard about that word.	1	6
Utopia.	1	6
The Greeks had two meanings for it:	1	6
"""Eu-topos,"""	1	6
"meaning ""the good place,"""	1	6
"and ""ou-topos,"""	1	6
"meaning ""the place that cannot be. """	1	6
I have to get back to the office.	1	6
I better not see this on my bill.	1	6
Okay, girls, playtime's over.	1	6
Time to put down your lipsticks and head back to your desks.	1	6
Thank you for your cooperation and your lips.	1	6
These go in the closet.	1	6
Well, now we have to count the shades they tried.	1	6
Can you bring me those tissues, dear?	1	6
Here's your basket of kisses.	1	6
Basket of kisses.	1	6
That's cute.	1	6
Who told you that?	1	6
What do you mean?	1	6
Where did you hear that?	1	6
I just thought of it.	1	6
Isn't that what it is?	1	6
It is, sweetheart.	1	6
Which color did you like?	1	6
I didn't get the one I liked.	1	6
Someone took my color.	1	6
Why didn't you choose another one?	1	6
I'm very particular.	1	6
As opposed to the other girls?	1	6
I don't know.	1	6
I don't think anyone wants to be one of a hundred colors in a box.	1	6
I think that's enough complaining.	1	6
Why don't you head back to your desk, Peggy?	1	6
Bet you wish you could pour that in a glass and drink it.	1	6
Peggy, clear the rest of my afternoon, would you, please?	1	6
You have the Snider's Catsup people at 3:00.	1	6
Have a box of cigars sent over to Jim King with my apologies.	1	6
I'll find out what he smokes.	1	6
Good girl.	1	6
You got a minute, Chief?	1	6
Just.	1	6
You don't mind, do you?	1	6
Use a glass, Freddie.	1	6
Your girl is full of surprises.	1	6
Oh, pretty Peggy Sue.	1	6
Peggy?	1	6
If you say so.	1	6
I try to avoid eye contact	1	6
to avoid being blinded by the earnestness.	1	6
Actually, she really stood out, brainstorming-wise.	1	6
Brainstorming?	1	6
Sorry I missed that.	1	6
What was the line?	1	6
A bucket of kisses.	1	6
Basket of kisses.	1	6
Bucket sounds better.	1	6
If you like 'em wet and sloppy.	1	6
The point is,	1	6
while the rest of the hens were busy pulling out each other's feathers,	1	6
that one saw the benefit, not the feature.	1	6
Really?	1	6
Yeah. She said she didn't want to be one of a hundred colors in a box.	1	6
That's interesting, isn't it?	1	6
It is.	1	6
It was like watching a dog play the piano.	1	6
It's me, Barbara. Can you talk?	1	6
She's still sleeping, thank God.	1	6
What's on your mind?	1	6
I think I might have met somebody.	1	6
You're not sure? That's good.	1	6
He has some serious limitations.	1	6
Does he work in the store?	1	6
No, he doesn't work at the store.	1	6
He has a job, doesn't he?	1	6
Yes.	1	6
Then what's the problem?	1	6
Would Daddy like him?	1	6
Daddy would hate him.	1	6
So he's not Jewish.	1	6
Who cares what Daddy thinks?	1	6
He's not your boyfriend anymore.	1	6
Barbara.	1	6
You're 28 years old.	1	6
You work 60 hours a week.	1	6
The last thing you want is to end up like Aunt Rosie,	1	6
lying to your nieces about how many engagements you had.	1	6
Aunt Rosie wasn't lying.	1	6
Oh, please, there was no Max the Communist.	1	6
Does he have all his hair?	1	6
More than he'll ever need.	1	6
Is he funny?	1	6
Sometimes. After a couple.	1	6
So he's a shikker. Daddy will hate him.	1	6
I do feel this attraction.	1	6
I want him,	1	6
and I want to ignore everything else about him.	1	6
It's 1960. We don't live in a shtetl.	1	6
We can marry for love.	1	6
I'm not sure people do that anymore.	1	6
Why do you always have to be so cynical?	1	6
Because sometimes... things come...	1	6
good things...	1	6
but there's no future in them.	1	6
You're a modern woman, Rach.	1	6
Forget the wedding.	1	6
Believe me, I'd do anything for some romance right now.	1	6
Peggy.	1	6
Hi, Joan.	1	6
Mr. Rumsen would like you to put your industrious little mind	1	6
towards coming up with copy for Belle Jolie Lipsticks.	1	6
I don't understand.	1	6
They want me to write something?	1	6
Whatever you said in that brainstorming session	1	6
apparently knocked their socks off.	1	6
Oh, my gosh.	1	6
I don't know what to say.	1	6
You will, of course, continue to cover Mr. Draper's desk.	1	6
Any writing you do will be on your own time.	1	6
Do I get a raise?	1	6
No.	1	6
Congratulations.	1	6
More work and more responsibility.	1	6
I guess you'll be entitled to some dinner money.	1	6
That's swell.	1	6
Maybe I should go and thank them?	1	6
I'm not really dressed. Tomorrow, maybe?	1	6
No need. They wanted me to tell you.	1	6
They were very specific about it.	1	6
Well, you know what they say: The medium is the message.	1	6
And here I was just wishing for a man to help me with my yard work.	1	6
Sorry.	1	6
That's what I get for being domestic.	1	6
Let's get this off.	1	6
Oh, God, hold that.	1	6
The thought.	1	6
Hi, Roy.	1	6
Hi, beautiful.	1	6
What's shakin'?	1	6
Busy dance card, huh?	1	6
Uh, Roy, this is my friend Don Draper.	1	6
Don, this is Roy Hazellit.	1	6
Pleasure.	1	6
Lan's playing down at the Gaslight.	1	6
We're gonna go support him, pass the basket.	1	6
You in?	1	6
That is if Dad will let you out.	1	6
Sounds like fun.	1	6
Don, we should go down for a while.	1	6
Come on. It'll be a kick. What do you say?	1	6
Afraid you'll miss the 5:31?	1	6
I think I'm gonna stay here.	1	6
I'll wear a skirt and nothing else.	1	6
What took you so long?	1	6
One of the media buyers ambushed me in the elevator	1	6
with tickets to the ballet, of all things.	1	6
I told him I had plans,	1	6
but he insisted we share a cab across town anyways.	1	6
I couldn't shake him.	1	6
Which one was it?	1	6
George Asbury. He's a hound.	1	6
It doesn't matter. They're all just boys.	1	6
Poor bastard probably couldn't help himself,	1	6
the way you glide around that office like some magnificent ship.	1	6
Well, I don't want to be a distraction.	1	6
Shall I, um, order horse blinders for the rest of the office?	1	6
You didn't.	1	6
Oh, I sure did.	1	6
Well, what am I supposed to do with it?	1	6
The store lady said you can do anything but put the cage on the radiator.	1	6
You're terrible.	1	6
Well, you can't blame a man for trying.	1	6
I just hate the thought of having to share you.	1	6
You don't have to share me now.	1	6
Joanie, you smell so good.	1	6
I've been thinking about this all day.	1	6
Mona is looking at a weekend in Old Saybrook with the in-laws.	1	6
There's not enough liquor in the world.	1	6
Roger.	1	6
Sorry.	1	6

No place to put your coat.	1	6
Switch seats with me.	1	6
No way.	1	6
Can we get a round over here?	1	6
Jack Daniels, Duchess.	1	6
Sounds like a great idea.	1	6
Anyway, turns out this Spanish cat and I	1	6
are mucho simpatico with the direction we talked about going.	1	6
"With the ""Theater of the People"" thing?"	1	6
Conscious drama.	1	6
Not the soulless bullshit	1	6
kept alive by the middle class	1	6
with their season tickets to Dick Van Dyke and Mary Martin.	1	6
I bet Don here can tell you firsthand.	1	6
Broadway is the birthplace of mediocrity.	1	6

Thank you, Don.	1	6
L'chaim.	1	6
So what do you do, Don?	1	6
I blow up bridges.	1	6
Don's in advertising.	1	6
No way.	1	6
Madison Avenue? What a gas.	1	6
We all have to serve somebody.	1	6
Perpetuating the lie.	1	6
How do you sleep at night?	1	6
On a bed made of money.	1	6
Isn't this an education?	1	6
You hucksters in your tower created the religion of mass consumption.	1	6
People want to be told what to do so badly that they'll listen to anyone.	1	6
When you say people,	1	6
I have a feeling you're talking about thou.	1	6
And I have a feeling	1	6
that you spent more time on your hair this morning than she did.	1	6
You two want to head to the urinals and poke it out?	1	6
So, Roy,	1	6
if you had a job...	1	6
what would you do?	1	6
I'm starting a theater, right here in the Village.	1	6
It's a cooperative.	1	6
Midge is going to get in there, paint some flats.	1	6
I said I'd think about it.	1	6
Last night I dreamed	1	6
of making love to Fidel Castro in a king-size bed	1	6
at the Waldorf-Astoria.	1	6
"""¡Viva la revoluciónl"" he roared,"	1	6
as he vanquished my dress.	1	6
Outside the window,	1	6
Nikita Khrushchev watched us,	1	6
plucking a chicken.	1	6
Take off your shirt!	1	6
Take your shirt off!	1	6
I should go.	1	6
Too much art for me.	1	6
Stay.	1	6
This is Ian.	1	6
We'll go right afterwards.	1	6

I know you said to call at night, but, uh, I haven't been alone.	1	7
I understand. I have a moment.	1	7
So how is she?	1	7
Well, it's only been a short period in therapeutic time.	1	7
But she's making progress?	1	7
She's not particularly forthcoming yet.	1	7
What has she been talking about?	1	7
Mostly, she seems consumed with petty jealousies	1	7
and overwhelmed with everyday activities.	1	7
Basically, we're dealing with the emotions of a child here.	1	7
She wasn't always like this.	1	7
 Well, we're finding that this kind of anxiety is not uncommon in housewives.	1	7
And let's not forget, the death of a parent is extremely destabilizing.	1	7
So that's it.	1	7
Well, that's the beginning, certainly.	1	7
As she becomes more forthcoming, we may be able	1	7
to shed some light on the deeper issues as she talks more.	1	7
- There are deeper issues? - Usually.	1	7
These are not groundbreaking revelations, Mr. Draper.	1	7
I'm concerned, obviously.	1	7
Of course. We both are.	1	7
Time and talk. That's what I recommend right now.	1	7
And again, evenings are better for me.	1	7
Well, I appreciate your time.	1	7
Mona, I am drinking my milk right now.	1	7
 Go to Mim's. Bring the heiress.	1	7
The Montclair air might wipe the scowl off her face.	1	7
Knock, knock.	1	7
Call me from there.	1	7
I'll try to make it out by Sunday afternoon.	1	7
I just got off the phone with UFC,	1	7
and they're having the Nixon boys stop by at the end of the week.	1	7
- With Nixon? - No, thank God.	1	7
Otherwise, I'd have to move the piano out of my office.	1	7
Hopefully, he'll decide he needs us.	1	7
Well, the ones with the best product make the worst clients.	1	7
Stop smoking so much.	1	7
It's a sign of weakness.	1	7
You know how Hitler got Neville Chamberlain	1	7
to give him everything at Munich?	1	7
He held the conference at an old palace that forbid smoking.	1	7
And after an hour and a half of not smoking,	1	7
Neville Chamberlain would have given Hitler his mother as a dance partner.	1	7
All I can get from this story is that Hitler didn't smoke.	1	7
And I do.	1	7
Good night, peanut.	1	7
Last one to Chumley's gets to wheel Kenneth Cosgrove,	1	7
published author, home in a baby carriage.	1	7
- Hello there. - Good news.	1	7
Mona and Margaret are going out of town for the weekend.	1	7
Mona's mother fell down the steps.	1	7
- You're really blessed. - Come on over.	1	7
I'll put on my whites. We'll pretend it's V.J. Day.	1	7
What goes in there, an aspirin?	1	7
I suppose I could have taken a suitcase anywhere this weekend.	1	7
And I don't mean your apartment.	1	7
I got us a couple of sandwiches, and filled a thermos for the train.	1	7
Mr. Sterling, this is Carol, my roommate.	1	7
Nice to meet you, Carol.	1	7
Miss Holloway, I have an accounting question.	1	7
We will go away. Not tonight, but some weekend coming up.	1	7
Puerto Rico?	1	7
I don't care if it's Cuba. I need a little notice.	1	7
You've got a lot of rules, Red.	1	7
Be good, girls.	1	7
I don't mind you staying late, just as long as you're not trying	1	7
- to milk us for the dinner money. - It's work.	1	7
Just because tomorrow's Friday doesn't mean I expect	1	7
to be pulling your head off the keys in the morning.	1	7
What are you doing tonight?	1	7
Uh, working and going home.	1	7
I'll let you enjoy that one, honey, but I was talking to Donald here.	1	7
- I'm on the 5:31. - Reservations at home.	1	7
I've had those. Easiest ones to break.	1	7
Besides, they love it when you keep them guessing. It adds spice.	1	7
Trying to get me in trouble? Betty's cooking.	1	7
One drink. You owe me that.	1	7
- Did I miss something? - No.	1	7
Don and I talk all the time when you're not around.	1	7
In fact, we're gonna do it right now.	1	7
Don? Shall we?	1	7
- Well, good night, boys. - Good night, Paul.	1	7
I love doing that.	1	7
You seem like a busy little girl.	1	7
Draper pushing you around enough?	1	7
What does that mean?	1	7
Burning the midnight oil is not good for your skin.	1	7
Oh, no, it's...	1	7
It's for something else. I'm working on copy.	1	7
On your own?	1	7
Mr. Rumsen liked what I did in the brainstorming thingy.	1	7
Sanitary napkins?	1	7
- No. Lipstick. - What did I say?	1	7
It's the Belle Jolie account.	1	7
Mr. Campbell, your wife called from the Four Seasons.	1	7
- They've been seated. - Thank you, Hildy.	1	7
Want me to take a look at it? I do it for a lot of the fellows.	1	7
Really?	1	7
Yeah. Really.	1	7
That would be super.	1	7
Well, we're all in it together.	1	7
Two!	1	7
So they fired all the guys in the middle and moved up their mail room staff,	1	7
right before all the salaries got expensive.	1	7
Smart.	1	7
Is that what we're gonna do?	1	7
We're not going to do anything.	1	7
At a certain age, they lose that.	1	7
What?	1	7
That glow of pure youth.	1	7
It's like they hit 30, and somebody puts out a light.	1	7
I don't think those two have 30 years between them.	1	7
Polka dots looks like a lot of fun.	1	7
Yeah, you'll have to let me know.	1	7
Jesus, you must be starving.	1	7
I know I am. What's Betty making?	1	7
I don't know.	1	7
Mona hasn't cooked since Margaret stopped eating.	1	7
They're fighting it out. I'm the one that gets hurt.	1	7
I'll call Betty. Tell her we'll be three.	1	7
No!	1	7
- You sure? - Are you kidding?	1	7
She'll be thrilled.	1	7
When's the last time she saw you?	1	7
We'll take my car. Save you train fare.	1	7
- My eyes are burning. - That's impossible.	1	7
That better not be Daddy saying he's going to be late.	1	7
Don't do gymnastics in the house.	1	7
Draper residence.	1	7
You are coming home, right?	1	7
Yes. I'm coming home.	1	7
Unfortunately, Roger has decided he needs a home-cooked meal.	1	7
You're kidding.	1	7
I don't know if I have enough food.	1	7
Birdie, what do you put in that freezer I bought you?	1	7
Frozen food.	1	7
What do you want me to say?	1	7
Betty, this steak...	1	7
You sure you don't want some?	1	7
No, thank you, Roger.	1	7
I'm a vegetarian sometimes.	1	7
Mona has a little calorie book she keeps on the refrigerator.	1	7
Always has her nose in there.	1	7
Maybe she wants to look good for you.	1	7
Isn't that a nice thought?	1	7
I was pudgy as a girl, if you can believe it.	1	7
I came into Home Ec in the 8th grade	1	7
with a pattern for big girl pajamas.	1	7
The teacher asked who I was making the pajamas for.	1	7
I didn't realize how much weight I'd lost that summer.	1	7
Swim camp, I guess.	1	7
I went from Tadpole to Polliwog that year.	1	7
Sounds like a lateral move.	1	7
When I was little, in the summer we used to swim at night.	1	7
In a pool, not the ocean.	1	7
Warm air,	1	7
light dancing in the blue...	1	7
Night swimming. It's divine.	1	7
Sometimes naked.	1	7
Believe me, on those nights, it was very difficult to go to sleep.	1	7
You ever experienced that, Don?	1	7
Trouble sleeping? Never.	1	7
Your husband's a funny son of a bitch, you know that, Betty?	1	7
Yeah.	1	7
We used to swim in a quarry.	1	7
By the way you drop your G's every once in a while,	1	7
I always thought you were raised on a farm.	1	7
Someplace with a swimmin' hole.	1	7
What do you say we go to a commercial break...	1	7
brought to you by more liquor?	1	7
You two.	1	7
Oh. Jesus, don't tell me it's your anniversary.	1	7
- No. - Don't worry.	1	7
Sally got this frosting machine.	1	7
"Oh. ""Mommy and Daddy. """	1	7
Simple, to the point, colloquial.	1	7
She writes like her father.	1	7
I'll get hers. You get your own.	1	7
Three on a match.	1	7
Never understood that.	1	7
Is that like three on a horse?	1	7
Trench war. First war.	1	7
"They used to say, ""First man lights up, they notice you."	1	7
"""Second man, Jerry takes aim."	1	7
"Third one... Auf wiedersehen. """	1	7
But the professional wisdom says that one of our guys	1	7
came up with that, as a way to sell matches.	1	7
You tell your kids there's no Santa Claus?	1	7
He'd never do that.	1	7
Tell us another story. A true one, though.	1	7
Well, my father was in the trenches.	1	7
With a bayonet.	1	7
Think about that.	1	7
Poking a man to death three feet away from you.	1	7
What does that sound like?	1	7
Don never talks about the war.	1	7
The war? His war, you mean.	1	7
Not much to say.	1	7
You boys used up all the glory.	1	7
We did, didn't we?	1	7
'Course, my old man will always have one on me with that bayonet.	1	7
My biggest hit came when we were running oil	1	7
down to the islands in the South China Sea.	1	7
The Pacific was all about gasoline.	1	7
People forget that.	1	7
You know what? I don't like to talk about it, either.	1	7
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.	1	7
Not much.	1	7
Now you have to tell us.	1	7
Well, the third day we picked up a Dinah circling the convoy.	1	7
A recon plane.	1	7
They were mapping us for the Nip suicide submarines up ahead...	1	7
kaitens... basically, warheads with motors.	1	7
Made us feel good to know we had such a dedicated enemy.	1	7
That's one way of thinking about it.	1	7
Maybe I was bored, but I thought, We should get that little plane.	1	7
Bored? What about scared?	1	7
That never comes in to these stories.	1	7
You're making me look bad in front of the lady.	1	7
That's impossible. Finish your story.	1	7
Well, we gave it to 'em.	1	7
Right at 12:00.	1	7
He was going away from us, but we hit him.	1	7
I watched him dive into the waves just beyond the horizon.	1	7
It was strange, because we knew it was over for him,	1	7
but we didn't see or hear much.	1	7
The next four hours, I took us off course, just to swing by.	1	7
Looking for a hole in the ocean, I guess.	1	7
We saw the wreckage. No chute, no body.	1	7
It's incredible that something that heavy can float.	1	7
Isn't that something?	1	7
- Bet they gave you a medal. - They did.	1	7
But not for that. It was for drinking.	1	7
Can something be done about this sadness?	1	7
Want to switch to gin?	1	7
Did you check the golf bag?	1	7
I have something out in the garage left over from New Year's.	1	7
I don't care if it has ants in it.	1	7
Roger, please, the kids.	1	7
Sally will be happy her cake was such a hit.	1	7
Make sure you tell her	1	7
"I ate the ""M"" in ""Mom. """	1	7
- Roger... - I can't believe you've had two babies.	1	7
Don't do that.	1	7
You've been making eyes at me all night.	1	7
You can't tell me that I'm not giving you hot pants.	1	7
You smell so good.	1	7
I can make more coffee.	1	7
I just want you to know that when I go to sleep tonight,	1	7
I will be thinking all about you.	1	7
Where'd you go, to Russia to get that?	1	7
No, I ran down the street knocking on doors.	1	7
Come on, you two. Come on out here and wish me a bon voyage.	1	7
I was just saying what a lucky man you are.	1	7
Beautiful children. Enjoy it.	1	7
One minute you're drinking at a bar,	1	7
and they come and tell you your kid's been born,	1	7
next thing you know, they're heading off to college.	1	7
Well, I should be on my way.	1	7
I'll take this for the road.	1	7
I'll walk you out.	1	7
Magical night.	1	7
That's my car.	1	7
There you go.	1	7
Lights!	1	7
- What was that? - What?	1	7
That. Him.	1	7
Felt like someone turned the oven on when I came back in here with that bottle.	1	7
- That's ridiculous. - Bullshit.	1	7
Nothing happened, Don.	1	7
Other than your drunk boss ruining our evening.	1	7
Can we leave it at that?	1	7
You seemed to be having a grand time.	1	7
I liked the wine.	1	7
You made a fool of yourself.	1	7
Why would you say that?	1	7
You were throwing yourself at him. Giggling at his stories.	1	7
I was being friendly. He's your boss.	1	7
I don't like to be treated that way in my own home.	1	7
I know what I saw.	1	7
You want to bounce me off the walls?	1	7
Would that make you feel better?	1	7
Sometimes I feel like I'm living with a little girl.	1	7
Humps, where were you last night?	1	7
I had a dinner with my in-laws at the Four Seasons... poolside.	1	7
Sounds refreshing.	1	7
Norman Mailer, Mayor Wagner.	1	7
The naked and the dead.	1	7
- What's in the box? - It's a wedding present.	1	7
- We got two. - But what is it?	1	7
- It's a Chip 'n' Dip. - Let me see.	1	7
- Are you serious? - Yeah!	1	7
I'm might have to go to somebody else's wedding.	1	7
I like to know what people are returning.	1	7
What?	1	7
I don't know what to say. You got two of these?	1	7
- What is it? - You have your fingers in your ears?	1	7
It's a Chip 'n' Dip. You have your friends over.	1	7
You put chips on the sides and dip in the middle.	1	7
- Dip? - Yes.	1	7
We went to these peoples' house, and they had one.	1	7
It had sour cream with these little brown onions in it.	1	7
It was very good.	1	7
You'll have to give me that recipe sometime.	1	7
Cost 22 bucks.	1	7
- Shit! - So.	1	7
I'm going to return it.	1	7
Today? Freddy Rumsen's cousin works at General Mills.	1	7
We're all going to Ratazzi's for lunch.	1	7
- Maybe dinner. - No.	1	7
"- I have to return this thing. - ""Today,"" she said, I'm sure."	1	7
I like doing things for her.	1	7
You're right. I'm sorry.	1	7
When you finish shopping, come join us.	1	7
I hear they make a great Grasshopper, Mildred.	1	7
Mr. Draper? Mr. Sterling to see you.	1	7
Send him in.	1	7
Something for the golf bag.	1	7
That's the good stuff.	1	7
I take it you got home in one piece.	1	7
I made it as far as the Knights Inn off the Taconic.	1	7
I know that place. It's got great water pressure.	1	7
Yeah, I slept in the car.	1	7
About last night.	1	7
What about it?	1	7
When a man gets to the point when his name's on the building,	1	7
he can get an unnatural sense of entitlement.	1	7
What does that mean, Roger?	1	7
You're not gonna make this easy.	1	7
I don't even know what this is.	1	7
One night, years ago, I got very drunk.	1	7
I drive home to my building,	1	7
pull into the garage, park at my spot.	1	7
I get in the elevator.	1	7
It's late. There's no operator.	1	7
Go up to the 12th floor. Get out.	1	7
I'm walking down the hall.	1	7
It's pink and orange.	1	7
I remember how ugly it was.	1	7
Suddenly, my key won't fit in the door.	1	7
Wasn't my building.	1	7
I guess what I'm saying is, uh...	1	7
at some point, we've all parked in the wrong garage.	1	7
Thanks for the bottle, Roger.	1	7
And?	1	7
Betty's going to want that glass back.	1	7
Good man.	1	7
Maybe I should get a case of those, huh?	1	7
This is taking a long time.	1	7
Is it that complicated?	1	7
Ah, the blue box. You must be a newlywed.	1	7
That explains it.	1	7
Yes, it does. Adorable.	1	7
My husband, he'd rather be drinking at lunch,	1	7
even when we were newlyweds, I think.	1	7
He's in advertising.	1	7
I'm in advertising. Sterling Cooper.	1	7
He's at BBDO. Media buyer.	1	7
Jim Wallace.	1	7
Don't know him.	1	7
That's because you're here at lunch.	1	7
Next.	1	7
I'm here to return this.	1	7
There's nothing wrong with it.	1	7
We got two.	1	7
That's why we suggest that people register, to avoid duplications.	1	7
We did register. We got two.	1	7
Do you have your receipt?	1	7
It was a gift.	1	7
Rosemary, we have a bridal return.	1	7
Him?	1	7
Bridal registry.	1	7
It's a Chip 'n' Dip. We got two.	1	7
That's practically four of something.	1	7
Name?	1	7
Campbell.	1	7
I suppose you don't have a receipt.	1	7
Gosh, I wish I did.	1	7
No. It was a gift.	1	7
There's nothing here.	1	7
Perhaps your wife told you she was registering	1	7
and in the end forgot to give us her name.	1	7
Her name?	1	7
Yes. It's under the maiden name.	1	7
Hmm. It's Vogel.	1	7
Why would you do that?	1	7
I don't know.	1	7
Humps.	1	7
Humps the Camel Campbell.	1	7
Matherton. What are you doing here?	1	7
Getting my racquet restrung.	1	7
Men's room back this way?	1	7
Down the hall past the water fountain.	1	7
What are you doing here?	1	7
Returning a wedding gift.	1	7
Not mine, I hope.	1	7
No, it's a Chip 'n' Dip. Trudy's aunt.	1	7
That's Trudy Vogel. Do you mind, lovely?	1	7
Uh, what is it?	1	7
It's a Chip 'n' Dip.	1	7
You put chips on the side and dip in the middle.	1	7
For entertaining.	1	7
It's a beaut.	1	7
Hell of a wedding, by the way.	1	7
Your cousin Bethany... bridesmaid's bridesmaid.	1	7
Connecticut College for Women, indeed.	1	7
I think I found it.	1	7
That's nice.	1	7
Good to see you. We should do this sometime.	1	7
I'm coming back for you.	1	7
Do you have a receipt?	1	7
No. I might have already said that.	1	7
It was a gift.	1	7
I can give you store credit.	1	7
I was expecting cash.	1	7
I'm sorry.	1	7
Isn't there a way we could work this out?	1	7
Let me by you a drink.	1	7
I have an expense account.	1	7
The best I can do is put the store credit in your name	1	7
so you can spend it here.	1	7
I would think about spending it on you if you gave me cash.	1	7
It's $22.	1	7
Store credit.	1	7
Thank you.	1	7
By the way, Matherton...	1	7
he has the clap.	1	7
Same price as a Chip 'n' Dip.	1	7
Amazing.	1	7
And I was going to try to make you feel bad	1	7
by telling you where Carlotta's stockings end.	1	7
What the hell is that for?	1	7
It's for me.	1	7
.22 caliber bolt action.	1	7
Use it in good health.	1	7
Why not?	1	7
Boys will be boys, right?	1	7
You couldn't hit the side of St. Patrick's with that.	1	7
It's good for 20 yards.	1	7
It's your 4:30, Mr. Campbell.	1	7
The Nixon brain trust is coming in tomorrow.	1	7
The nomination is expected as a lock.	1	7
All we need is an opponent.	1	7
Rumor is Lyndon Johnson's going to be making a play at the Convention,	1	7
so we may not be going against Kennedy at all.	1	7
Then we have to worry about the South.	1	7
It's going to be Kennedy.	1	7
Boston Blackie won West Virginia.	1	7
Now, where does that leave us?	1	7
"""Nixon: Experience in office, knows foreign affairs. """	1	7
He probably learned that	1	7
when they were throwing rocks at him in Caracas.	1	7
"""Knows the real threat of communism, home and abroad. """	1	7
He's not helping himself keeping quiet on Castro.	1	7
True, but he's not a Catholic.	1	7
Our hands are tied there.	1	7
Nixon thinks hitting the Catholic thing is a bad idea.	1	7
They're going to say that.	1	7
To us? They believe it.	1	7
It hasn't held up in any of the primaries.	1	7
Kennedy keeps making opponents apologize.	1	7
For what?	1	7
For being intolerant.	1	7
This is Dick Nixon we're talking about.	1	7
You may be too young to remember	1	7
"the ""pink lady"" congress... woman from California."	1	7
He practically shot her in the face to win.	1	7
If it is Kennedy,	1	7
Nixon will lower himself to the occasion.	1	7
It's going to be Kennedy.	1	7
Good. Catholic son of a millionaire.	1	7
A boy too scared to do anything but go on vacation.	1	7
I met him. He is a boy.	1	7
He's only four years younger than Nixon.	1	7
But has he been sitting next to the leader of the free world	1	7
for twice that time?	1	7
He's inexperienced.	1	7
He doesn't even wear a hat.	1	7
I don't know.	1	7
You know who else doesn't wear a hat?	1	7
Elvis.	1	7
That's what we're dealing with.	1	7
Remind me to stop hiring young people.	1	7
America does not want some greasy kid	1	7
with his finger on the button.	1	7
Now if the adults can weigh in?	1	7
"""Communism, taxes, health care. """	1	7
Kinsey, you want to write this down, or should I call a girl in?	1	7
Hi, honey. I made a roast beef.	1	7
Just cut the strings.	1	7
Oh, roast beef?	1	7
You know it's just me tonight, right?	1	7
That was a wedding gift from my Aunt Letty!	1	7
And you go and get some stupid toy?	1	7
I can't believe you!	1	7
That was for us!	1	7
You're always telling me to grow up.	1	7
I can't believe you!	1	7
Oh, I can leave it there?	1	7
Thanks.	1	7
Great. Thank you.	1	7
Hollis, let me ask you something.	1	7
Uh, Mr. Campbell,	1	7
I thought I'd take you up on your offer to look at my work.	1	7
But if you're in the middle of something...	1	7
What's that?	1	7
A wedding present.	1	7
I really appreciate it.	1	7
You ever been hunting, Peggy?	1	7
No, I don't think so.	1	7
You either have or you haven't.	1	7
I went a couple of times with my uncle.	1	7
New Hampshire.	1	7
I saw my cousin shoot a rabbit by Coney Island.	1	7
It's an incredible sensation.	1	7
You have to be very quiet.	1	7
Take it down with the first shot,	1	7
or you scare it away.	1	7
And sometimes you have to go up and finish it off.	1	7
Then you tie it to the bumper, and you go home.	1	7
But you know what I've always wanted to do?	1	7
I would pick it up...	1	7
throw its back legs over my shoulder,	1	7
and I would drag it through the snow to this little cabin.	1	7
And there...	1	7
I'd hang it up...	1	7
between a couple of trees,	1	7
cut it open,	1	7
drain it,	1	7
dress it,	1	7
and then I'd take my big hunting knife,	1	7
and I'd cut this loin right out of the side.	1	7
And I'd go into the cabin,	1	7
and there'd be this woman waiting for me,	1	7
standing by one of those old stoves	1	7
with a big black pipe,	1	7
and I'd hand it to her,	1	7
and she'd put it in a cast-iron skillet,	1	7
and then I'd sit at the table...	1	7
and she'd bring it to me.	1	7
And I'd wipe my knife on my knee...	1	7
and then I would eat it while she watches.	1	7
That would be wonderful.	1	7
I'll take a look at this for you.	1	7
Thank you.	1	7
Can I get a ham sandwich?	1	7
You know what? I'll take a cherry Danish.	1	7
The big one in the back.	1	7
Thank you, ma'am. There you go.	1	7
Helen. Hello.	1	7
Hi, Betty.	1	7
How are you?	1	7
I'm well.	1	7
And how's Glen?	1	7
I wasn't going to say anything.	1	7
I was just going to go right on by.	1	7
What's wrong?	1	7
I was going...	1	7
I was going through Glen's treasure box the other day,	1	7
and I found a lock of blonde hair.	1	7
Your hair, he says.	1	7
Well, I don't know what he told you.	1	7
Glen doesn't lie, not when he's caught.	1	7
- I'm not saying it's a lie. - Betty.	1	7
He asked me for it.	1	7
And you gave it to him?	1	7
He is 9 years old.	1	7
What is wrong with you?	1	7
He was a bold man that first ate an oyster.	1	7
I believe that was Jonathan Swift.	1	7
Are we naming them now?	1	7
Look at you.	1	7
I had no idea you were such a fan of the mollusk.	1	7
Never gave them a chance before, but I'm acquiring a taste.	1	7
It's like eating a mermaid.	1	7
Ready for another, or have you topped off your tank?	1	7
You're leading this dance.	1	7
Well, what the hell? It's the G.O.P.	1	7
They'll never smell it over the stench of Brylcreem.	1	7
Another round.	1	7
Wait. Are you still good with these,	1	7
or do you prefer your beloved rye?	1	7
Today I'm on the Roger Sterling diet.	1	7
Easy on the vermouth, another dozen of these.	1	7
Me, as well.	1	7
I've always thought you were a man who could keep up, Don.	1	7
Anything else, gentlemen?	1	7
Did you know they served cheesecake	1	7
to the Olympic athletes in ancient Greece?	1	7
So what's an extra lap or two around the steno pool for us?	1	7
Two cheesecakes.	1	7
And don't let me see the bottom of this glass.	1	7
What were we talking about?	1	7
Oh, yes, the Russians.	1	7
Shooting those dogs into space.	1	7
I believe we branded them cat lovers and moved on to the subject of true love.	1	7
Right. Desi and Lucy... please.	1	7
He's divorcing her again.	1	7
"Did he wake up one morning and say ""Oh, yeah, I forgot, I hate you""?"	1	7
What makes a man marry the same woman twice?	1	7
I believe in his case,	1	7
it was the lure of orange hair.	1	7
I like redheads.	1	7
Their mouths are like a drop of strawberry jam in a glass of milk.	1	7
I think I woke my ulcer up.	1	7
Drinking milk.	1	7
I never liked it.	1	7
I hate cows.	1	7
You keep matching me like this,	1	7
you'll have an ulcer of your own, any day now.	1	7
One more?	1	7
Instead of coffee?	1	7
Sure.	1	7
But then we should get the check.	1	7
Hey, Birdie. I have the shirt.	1	7
What is this?	1	7
Bobby spilled some Concord grape juice down the front of it.	1	7
I washed it.	1	7
Uh, this is Ernie's shirt, not Bobby's.	1	7
Well, what do you know?	1	7
Oh, did you have a party you didn't invite me to?	1	7
I'll invite you. It's going to be a dinner party.	1	7
I'm just trying the wine, you know.	1	7
Develop my palate.	1	7
Do you want some? It's a split.	1	7
There's another glass.	1	7
How are you?	1	7
I'm good.	1	7
Maybe I will try some.	1	7
Betty,	1	7
Jill Sandifer was in the market earlier today.	1	7
What?	1	7
Is it true?	1	7
You're my friend, Francine.	1	7
Are you coming over here to do recon?	1	7
I'm worried about you.	1	7
I don't know what happened.	1	7
I kept thinking in the car on the way back,	1	7
"""Did that really happen?"""	1	7
And...	1	7
then I just put it out of my mind.	1	7
Well, what did happen?	1	7
Whatever you heard.	1	7
I mean, I don't even want to hear it.	1	7
I have my own version, and it's plenty.	1	7
It's okay.	1	7
Honestly, I don't know anyone	1	7
who wouldn't want to take a good poke at her.	1	7
She's so selfish.	1	7
Those long walks	1	7
and that pathetic job at Benson's Jewelry.	1	7
Carlton went in there to buy me some earrings.	1	7
I'm sure she loved that.	1	7
When I saw the Benson's Jewelry wrapping paper,	1	7
I almost threw it in his face.	1	7
And that John Kennedy. I hate him.	1	7
Really?	1	7
What will people think?	1	7
I think they'll be glad to know you're not a marshmallow.	1	7
Do people think I'm weak?	1	7
No. It's just you're so sweet and perfect.	1	7
I'm not.	1	7
Well, it does seem that way.	1	7
Look, it'll all be forgotten.	1	7
We don't have to include Helen Bishop anymore.	1	7
Let her know whose side we're all on.	1	7
Uh, my mother...	1	7
always said,	1	7
"""You're painting a masterpiece."	1	7
"Make sure to hide the brushstrokes. """	1	7
She was really beautiful.	1	7
Then I think, um...	1	7
"""Why am I doing all this? I'm not that vain. """	1	7
What does Dr. Wayne say?	1	7
Nothing...	1	7
"except ""Tell me more about that. """	1	7
I'm still dying to try it.	1	7
I'm pretty sure Dr. Wayne tried to look down my neckline the other day.	1	7
He sits behind me.	1	7
And as far as I'm concerned, as long as men look at me that way,	1	7
I'm earning my keep.	1	7
Then every once in a while,	1	7
I think...	1	7
No.	1	7
This is something else.	1	7
I don't want my husband to see this.	1	7
I love to be looked at that way.	1	7
You should get out of here.	1	7
Nap time is about to end.	1	7
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.	1	7
We haven't gone over the Nixon plan.	1	7
You prepared, right?	1	7
In what way?	1	7
I'm sorry, gentlemen.	1	7
Mr. Sterling, Mr. Draper, I'm waiting for service.	1	7
So am I. What are you talking about?	1	7
We're out of order.	1	7
Oh, crap.	1	7
When will they be back up? Should we wait?	1	7
We've got our best man on it.	1	7
That's a comfort.	1	7
Jesus, we're already late.	1	7
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Sterling.	1	7
It's certainly a believable excuse.	1	7
We could go back to lunch.	1	7
No. Cooper would have a seizure, if he hasn't already.	1	7
So?	1	7
Ah, this is ridiculous. A building this big.	1	7
What if there was a fire?	1	7
We'd be walking down.	1	7
It would be easier.	1	7
Maybe we should check the elevator.	1	7
Maybe it's up again.	1	7
I think we'd hear it go on in the stairwell.	1	7
You think?	1	7
Roger, I don't know.	1	7
Maybe they're late, too.	1	7
Maybe we could get them to come down	1	7
and have the presentation on the eighth floor landing.	1	7
There's plenty of seats.	1	7
Damned elevator.	1	7
What do you want to do? We're almost there.	1	7
The hell we are.	1	7
Well, we can waste another five minutes talking about it, if you want.	1	7
Let's go.	1	7
Get behind me with that thing.	1	7
Six to go.	1	7
I've been counting.	1	7
You want to rest a minute?	1	7
No, sir. No, I don't.	1	7
Keep moving.	1	7
I forgot. Navy man.	1	7
I love redheads.	1	7
With big breasts.	1	7
We'll find you one if we still have jobs.	1	7
Want me to run ahead?	1	7
Run?	1	7
My name's on the building.	1	7
They can wait for me.	1	7
I got to stop talking.	1	7
I'm fine.	1	7
Just lost my tie clip.	1	7
I'll find it. Go on.	1	7
You sure?	1	7
I said go on.	1	7
Found it!	1	7
- Where the hell were you? - Elevator's out.	1	7
- That's quite a hike. Where's Sterling? - He's coming.	1	7
Well, here are the troops now.	1	7
Lou, Michael, Charlie, uh, Don Draper.	1	7
Hey, Don.	1	7
Our creative muscle.	1	7
Hopefully, a little brains, too.	1	7
Sorry to keep you fellas waiting.	1	7
The elevator's out.	1	7
Pete Campbell, of course.	1	7
We've spoken on the phone.	1	7
Yeah, yeah.	1	7
He'll continue handling things for you.	1	7
And when I say handling, I mean he runs everything by me.	1	7
And, of course, uh, my partner, Roger Sterling.	1	7
We heard the elevator's down.	1	7
Those boys over at United Fruit	1	7
talk about you like you invented the damn banana.	1	7
Whoa, whoa, whoa.	1	7
You all right, Roger?	1	7
Get us some ice water.	1	7
Oysters.	1	7
I can see that.	1	7
23 floors.	1	7
I'm just sorry I missed this lunch.	1	7
We were with some Quakers. Had cottage cheese.	1	7
Well, let's let Roger regroup.	1	7
- Okay. - Yeah.	1	7
This way.	1	7
I'll be right in.	1	7
You okay?	1	7
Yeah.	1	7
Fine.	1	7
Good.	1	7
Hold the doors, please!	1	8
Thank you. Good morning.	1	8
Good morning.	1	8
Draper has you in early, huh?	1	8
- What's he up to? - I don't know.	1	8
I kind of came in for myself.	1	8
Okay.	1	8
Honestly, I couldn't sleep.	1	8
I'm just filled with nerves.	1	8
The service elevator is out.	1	8
Do you mind?	1	8
 I'm moving today.	1	8
I'm supposed to go by at lunch and supervise the movers.	1	8
Probably lose the rest of the day watching other people work.	1	8
Well, that is a big day.	1	8
What do you have to be nervous about?	1	8
Nothing.	1	8
Just I think Mr. Rumsen is presenting my copy today to the Belle Jolie people.	1	8
A thing like that.	1	8
We really took the local, didn't we?	1	8
It's 7 in the morning.	1	8
I'm very sorry, sir.	1	8
Here we are.	1	8
I'm going to hop down for a coffee.	1	8
- Would you like some? - No.	1	8
 Are you sure?	1	8
Come in here, please.	1	8
Close the door.	1	8
There's no one here.	1	8
Close the door.	1	8
Peggy... do you know how hard it is	1	8
to see you walking around here every day?	1	8
Your skirt. It's tight.	1	8
Just pull it up.	1	8
Be careful.	1	8
Listen,	1	8
maybe this isn't the right time to mention this,	1	8
but I want to clear the air.	1	8
I know I told you I would read the copy that you wrote,	1	8
but... I haven't.	1	8
I'm glad.	1	8
I thought you just didn't like it.	1	8
That's too bad.	1	8
Peggy.	1	8
I know what you're going to say.	1	8
No.	1	8
You don't.	1	8
You haven't been right once.	1	8
I have all these things going on in my head, and I can't say them.	1	8
Do you think about me?	1	8
I'll be honest.	1	8
A few times.	1	8
You're only 20 yards away.	1	8
Not right now.	1	8
I wake up in the morning and I look into Trudy's eyes,	1	8
"and I think, ""We're supposed to be one person. """	1	8
But whatever I try...	1	8
I have all these things going on in my head.	1	8
She's just another stranger.	1	8
Pete.	1	8
You're not alone in this.	1	8
I'm sorry I ripped your blouse.	1	8
It's okay.	1	8
Morning. Sterling Cooper. Please hold.	1	8
Look who's off the clock again.	1	8
He's speaking Italian to his mother.	1	8
Ciao, ciao.	1	8
My stars.	1	8
Two weeks in, and she's already a goner.	1	8
He talks to his mother a lot.	1	8
Mr. Crane? I'll connect you.	1	8
Because he's not married.	1	8
Well, he's in the Art Department?	1	8
What does he look like?	1	8
Did you see that movie Marty with Ernest Borgnine?	1	8
He lived with his mother.	1	8
Stop teasing her.	1	8
Yes, right away.	1	8
My guess is tall, dark, and handsome,	1	8
but I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal.	1	8
She is so thoughtful.	1	8
- Let me get my purse. - Forget it.	1	8
Mrs. Sterling will be calling before lunchtime today.	1	8
Please put her through directly to me.	1	8
- Done. - Ask her. She'll know.	1	8
Salvatore Romano in the Art Department.	1	8
Do you know him?	1	8
Handsome. Very debonair.	1	8
Cologne, but not the cheap stuff.	1	8
Something European, maybe.	1	8
You're so specific.	1	8
You have voices. I have other things.	1	8
Thank you so much for holding.	1	8
Good morning.	1	8
Good morning.	1	8
Mr. Cooper wanted to see you in his office.	1	8
Tell Mr. Sterling I'll be right there.	1	8
No, it's just Mr. Cooper.	1	8
Thank you, Peggy.	1	8
What happened there?	1	8
I caught it on something.	1	8
I might start keeping a spare.	1	8
Come on in.	1	8
I'd prefer you didn't smoke in here right now.	1	8
Don, I am appreciative of your talents,	1	8
and although that cannot be measured,	1	8
I have made an effort to quantify.	1	8
$2,500.	1	8
L...	1	8
Thank you. That's what you say.	1	8
Have you read her?	1	8
Rand.	1	8
Atlas Shrugged.	1	8
That's the one.	1	8
Yes. Yes, it is.	1	8
See, I know you haven't read it.	1	8
When you hit 40,	1	8
you realize you've met or seen every kind of person there is,	1	8
and I know what kind you are.	1	8
Because I believe we are alike.	1	8
I assume that's flattering.	1	8
By that I mean you are a productive and reasonable man,	1	8
and in the end completely self-interested.	1	8
It's strength.	1	8
We are different...	1	8
unsentimental about all the people	1	8
who depend on our hard work.	1	8
Take $1.99 out of that $2,500 and buy yourself a copy.	1	8
I will.	1	8
Well, hello, there.	1	8
Hello.	1	8
Are you Traffic, or are you here for casting?	1	8
I'm... I'm not a model.	1	8
I'm new.	1	8
Excuse me, Marty,	1	8
who's doing the Firestone comps, you or Frank?	1	8
Neither of us. Sal. We were talking to Miss...	1	8
Lois. Lois Sadler.	1	8
I'm new here. Switchboard.	1	8
Marty Faraday.	1	8
Why would they hide you?	1	8
Hi, Lois. Duane Davis.	1	8
Salvatore Romano.	1	8
Sorry about the mess.	1	8
Oh, no, it's divine.	1	8
I work in a closet all day,	1	8
so just to come out and walk around is wonderful.	1	8
Is there anything I can do for you?	1	8
I'm such a featherhead.	1	8
I need to get my paperwork in to Accounting,	1	8
then find my way back to the switchboard room.	1	8
Am I close?	1	8
No. You're not even on the right floor.	1	8
I'll walk you there.	1	8
No. Just point me there. I'm fine.	1	8
Go upstairs,	1	8
make a left outside of the stairwell,	1	8
follow the wall past the ladies' room.	1	8
Well, nice to meet you.	1	8
Ciao, ciao.	1	8
That ate up some time.	1	8
I like when they flirt with me.	1	8
She was flirting with him.	1	8
You know, I had the salesman pushing this tie on me for 20 minutes.	1	8
I'd have bought it right away if I knew it worked.	1	8
It's not the ties. They always talk to you.	1	8
They can tell you make money.	1	8
I told you, you don't need money to dress better than you do, Duane.	1	8
Mr. Campbell, I have your wife.	1	8
What line?	1	8
Light up a line, will you?	1	8
No, she's right here, in person.	1	8
Send her in.	1	8
Hello, my love.	1	8
Hello, homeowner.	1	8
What are you doing here, lovely?	1	8
I thought I'd come get you and we could go together.	1	8
We could even walk.	1	8
It's 30 blocks.	1	8
It's beautiful outside.	1	8
I have a, uh, busier day than I thought.	1	8
Well, then let's do this here.	1	8
I said I'd meet you there if my schedule allowed,	1	8
and now it doesn't look so good.	1	8
No, you didn't, and I'm here now.	1	8
What does it matter?	1	8
This is my office.	1	8
How do you think it looks?	1	8
Like you are beloved by your wife.	1	8
You see what happens when you just show up like this?	1	8
We fight.	1	8
I came here to celebrate us having our apartment,	1	8
which I for one am happy about.	1	8
And you have ruined it.	1	8
I'm sorry.	1	8
I'm just busier than I thought.	1	8
Let's have a glass of champagne.	1	8
I'm sorry.	1	8
We're going to live there a long time.	1	8
There's no point in being superstitious.	1	8
It's as simple as E pluribus unum:	1	8
"""From many, one. """	1	8
From many shades of lipstick, one that belongs to her.	1	8
From a basket of kisses, she picks one.	1	8
It makes her unique. It colors her kiss.	1	8
And her kiss, well, it colors her man.	1	8
"""Belle Jolie Lipstick. Mark Your Man. """	1	8
I only see one lipstick in your drawing.	1	8
Women want colors, lots and lots of colors.	1	8
"""Mark Your Man. """	1	8
It's pretty cute.	1	8
Oh, you like this?	1	8
Well, maybe we should cut down to five shades or one.	1	8
I'm not telling you to listen to anyone, but this is a very fresh approach.	1	8
It's okay, Kenny.	1	8
I don't think there's much else to do here but call it a day.	1	8
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.	1	8
Is that all?	1	8
You're a nonbeliever.	1	8
Why should we waste time on Kabuki?	1	8
I don't know what that means.	1	8
It means that you've already tried your plan,	1	8
and you're number 4.	1	8
You've enlisted my expertise,	1	8
and you've rejected it to go on the way you've been going.	1	8
I'm not interested in that. You can understand.	1	8
I don't think your three months or however many thousands of dollars	1	8
entitles you to refocus the core of our business.	1	8
Listen, I'm not here to tell you about Jesus.	1	8
You already know about Jesus.	1	8
Either He lives in your heart or He doesn't.	1	8
Every woman wants choices,	1	8
but in the end, none wants to be one of a hundred in a box.	1	8
She's unique.	1	8
She makes the choices, and she's chosen him.	1	8
"She wants to tell the world, ""He's mine."	1	8
"He belongs to me, not you. """	1	8
She marks her man with her lips.	1	8
He is her possession.	1	8
You've given every girl that wears your lipstick	1	8
the gift of total ownership.	1	8
Sit down.	1	8
No.	1	8
Not until I know I'm not wasting my time.	1	8
Sit down.	1	8
Do you know how to get back to the Roosevelt?	1	8
We could have someone walk you over, or just meet you, if you're interested.	1	8
You're a troublemaker.	1	8
Although, it is a place to get into trouble.	1	8
They just did this incredible renovation.	1	8
It reminds me a little of a steamship.	1	8
And the people...	1	8
I was in the lounge last night,	1	8
and I end up having a drink with Robert Mitchum.	1	8
Actually, many drinks.	1	8
Now, you know we wouldn't steer you wrong.	1	8
Nice work. I think you may be right about this.	1	8
Well, we'll never know, will we?	1	8
What?	1	8
It's not a science, Hugh.	1	8
We'll do our best.	1	8
That Jesus thing.	1	8
I don't know what to say.	1	8
Probably better than dangling him out the window by his ankles.	1	8
That's just a story.	1	8
Don's never actually done that.	1	8
Ken, you will realize in your private life	1	8
that at a certain point seduction is over and force is actually being requested.	1	8
Ah, he's a kid.	1	8
He thinks it's the other way around.	1	8
Peggy, icel We'll need some.	1	8
Should I just put it down?	1	8
How much ice?	1	8
How do you take it?	1	8
Home run, ballerina.	1	8
Go ahead, before Joan Holloway sees.	1	8
You call that celebrating?	1	8
The meeting was so long, I was worried.	1	8
We barely finished the presentation, and he bought it.	1	8
No, he's being modest.	1	8
Donald walked around the village three times	1	8
and then set it on fire.	1	8
Oh, my God. Can I see it?	1	8
It's marvelous.	1	8
I thought it was going to say	1	8
"""It's the mark you make on your man. """	1	8
Was it, now?	1	8
You may be a writer, honey.	1	8
Really?	1	8
You're arrogant.	1	8
You want another drink?	1	8
I don't know.	1	8
- Not a writer. - Not a writer.	1	8
Can I keep it?	1	8
No.	1	8
What are you doing?	1	8
Don't ever put your name on a list.	1	8
They keep track of everything we do here.	1	8
Have you never heard of Joseph McCarthy?	1	8
It's the bowling team.	1	8
Oh, my God. It happened.	1	8
- They loved it. - What are you talking about?	1	8
I'm heading out. Don't look for me.	1	8
I have errands to run.	1	8
My Belle Jolie copy. They loved it.	1	8
Congratulations!	1	8
That's so fascinating!	1	8
I'm glad your other work was suffering for a reason.	1	8
They poured me a drink.	1	8
- Who? - Mr. Draper.	1	8
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Romano, and...	1	8
Oh, I'm so jealous.	1	8
Don't be. I was just... I shouldn't be bragging.	1	8
They sold Peggy's copy.	1	8
My word.	1	8
Actually, they changed it a little bit,	1	8
but it worked.	1	8
- Oh, we're celebrating. - How about it?	1	8
Five minutes to 5, we head to P.J. Clarke's.	1	8
Perfect!	1	8
It's going to be a hell of an afternoon traffic meeting.	1	8
Oh, champagne.	1	8
When did that happen?	1	8
Another grateful client stopped by.	1	8
I thought you were moving today.	1	8
I was looking forward to seeing you in a pair of coveralls.	1	8
Yes, well, I managed to explain to the concerned party	1	8
that I already have a job.	1	8
Do they ever stop asking for things?	1	8
Hello.	1	8
Hello.	1	8
Hildy, um, she must have gone to lunch already.	1	8
Congratulations.	1	8
Yes. I hear you're quite the little scribe.	1	8
You can trust Ken's opinion here.	1	8
He's a published author, you know.	1	8
But he can't write copy.	1	8
I don't like to limit my words that much.	1	8
I also hate puns.	1	8
Come on.	1	8
"""Admiral: The television that won't go down the tubes. """	1	8
Shut up.	1	8
So you going to celebrate?	1	8
Well, yes, actually.	1	8
A bunch of us... just the girls so far... are going to P. J. Clarke's tonight.	1	8
Forget tonight. I heard Cooper, Sterling, and Draper already left.	1	8
Am I wrong?	1	8
What about Mr. Rumsen?	1	8
Freddie Rumsen's at P.J.'s right now,	1	8
and he doesn't know there's a party.	1	8
3:00, after the traffic meeting.	1	8
Joan's a tattletale.	1	8
I don't know, Peggy.	1	8
I'm kind of senior ranking when those other men are gone.	1	8
Speaker of the House. He'll be there.	1	8
I should probably go home, actually.	1	8
Well, if we're starting at 3, you can go home at 5.	1	8
It'll still be after work.	1	8
We all work so hard,	1	8
I think we all need it.	1	8
Why not?	1	8
Toodle-oo.	1	8
Hello.	1	8
Mr. Romano, I was headed out to lunch,	1	8
but I have a phone call for you.	1	8
Well, I'm glad I stayed in.	1	8
Oh, it's disconnected.	1	8
Everybody's talking about the meeting.	1	8
Miss Olsen said your artwork was spectacular.	1	8
She did, did she?	1	8
Anyway, a bunch of us	1	8
are taking her out to drinks.	1	8
P.J. Clarke's?	1	8
She deserves it.	1	8
You have to come.	1	8
This is Lois Sadler, by the way.	1	8
I know that.	1	8
I'll be there.	1	8
Good.	1	8
Can I help you?	1	8
Can I help you, sir?	1	8
It's Don. The ad man.	1	8
He's okay.	1	8
Excuse me, fellas.	1	8
Oh, just because I can't call you doesn't mean you can't call me.	1	8
Hello.	1	8
Pack a bag. We're going to Paris.	1	8
- What? - Paris.	1	8
Now?	1	8
Where'd you get that?	1	8
It's a bonus.	1	8
I'm not sure what for.	1	8
I bet.	1	8
What do you say?	1	8
I called Idyllwild.	1	8
We can have breakfast at Versailles.	1	8
I'm sorry.	1	8
I have a special night planned.	1	8
I thought you didn't make plans.	1	8
Is he joining us?	1	8
Yes. He has to.	1	8
He looks kind of square.	1	8
Kibby just came four days straight from Juarez.	1	8
May I?	1	8
I've been thinking about this since Port Authority.	1	8
Stay. You'll love it.	1	8
We're going to get high and listen to Miles.	1	8
That's your plan?	1	8
We can do this first and then do that.	1	8
It'll be a lot more fun.	1	8
Sit down. Relax.	1	8
Next to me, Icky.	1	8
Where did you find him?	1	8
You know you need to leave the Village for a decent screw.	1	8
I'll take care of him.	1	8
Do you like it?	1	8
I feel like Dorothy.	1	8
Everything just turned to color.	1	8
The words.	1	8
You are good with the words, man.	1	8
Well put.	1	8
Kibby, why don't you make yourself useful and get me a glass of water?	1	8
My word, I need to get one of those.	1	8
No, thanks.	1	8
Okay.	1	8
Maybe.	1	8
We realize there's no music playing.	1	8
Just the...	1	8
Good afternoon, ma'am.	1	8
I'm embarrassed to ask, seeing as we all have it hard right now,	1	8
but is there any way I can trouble you for a meal?	1	8
I'm willing to work for it.	1	8
Look around you.	1	8
We're not Christians here no more.	1	8
That is not true.	1	8
Fine, fine.	1	8
Work will feed your soul,	1	8
but there's no work left here today.	1	8
Come back tomorrow?	1	8
Nonsense.	1	8
You'll stay with us and eat with us,	1	8
and work tomorrow.	1	8
I will have to boil those clothes, though,	1	8
if you're going to sit at my table.	1	8
I'm not offended.	1	8
It would be a relief to me as well.	1	8
Dick Whitman, stop digging holes.	1	8
Build a fire under the cauldron.	1	8
Hiya, kid.	1	8
What did I say to you?	1	8
Reminds me of myself.	1	8
That doesn't surprise me at all.	1	8
So we thank You, Lord,	1	8
for this bounty we are about to receive	1	8
that we may share it with those in need.	1	8
Amen.	1	8
Thank you again. Thank you so much.	1	8
This smells delicious.	1	8
Where are those manners from?	1	8
Let him eat and be on with it.	1	8
I'm from just east.	1	8
About New York, originally, some other places.	1	8
Ah. New York.	1	8
It's how you took to being on the bum so easy.	1	8
Archie, no one takes to charity easy.	1	8
I'm just saying I bet he don't know which end of a weed to pull.	1	8
That's the truth, sir. I only know some farm work,	1	8
but I've seen mills and docks and factories.	1	8
I've been a worker.	1	8
Are you a communist?	1	8
No.	1	8
Yeah, I imagine they're different, all right.	1	8
They take a club to the jaw like anyone else.	1	8
They are souls, but they can't be saved.	1	8
That's true.	1	8
My mom always said that life is like a horseshoe.	1	8
It's fat in the middle, open on both ends,	1	8
and hard all the way through.	1	8
Tomorrow...	1	8
when you've finished some work.	1	8
Bless you.	1	8
I had to see this place for myself.	1	8
Good.	1	8
It's something, huh?	1	8
No Bob Mitchum?	1	8
What are you drinking?	1	8
Campari with a twist.	1	8
You know, when I mentioned the renovation,	1	8
I didn't know if you heard me.	1	8
I've been curious about seeing this place.	1	8
I'm actually involved with architects on this department store.	1	8
Signage, mostly.	1	8
I like this room, although I am its prime target:	1	8
Traveling salesman.	1	8
In that suit? I should say not.	1	8
No, I'm not one of those boys who looks forward to a business trip	1	8
to escape the wife and kids.	1	8
I'm really a homebody.	1	8
But New York?	1	8
When you arrive,	1	8
and that train starts slowing down	1	8
and it gets all dark,	1	8
my heart pounds, and I think,	1	8
"""I'm going to climb that staircase and be in New York. """	1	8
I take it for granted.	1	8
It is a masterpiece of some kind.	1	8
Wherever I'm staying, I always demand a view.	1	8
It's building after building.	1	8
Little compartments filled with possibilities.	1	8
What's that from?	1	8
42nd Street?	1	8
What?	1	8
Uh, no.	1	8
No. I'm just saying it's...	1	8
it's like you can do anything.	1	8
I'm two ahead of you.	1	8
I have to eat something,	1	8
or I'm going to continue to rhapsodize.	1	8
What time is it?	1	8
I bet you don't have an expense account.	1	8
I'm not saying Peggy doesn't have something upstairs.	1	8
I'm just saying at Sterling Cooper	1	8
things are usually happening downstairs.	1	8
I didn't know that.	1	8
My God, the whole office is here.	1	8
I don't see the Art Department.	1	8
What about those two?	1	8
Uh, I think I had too much to drink.	1	8
You are very petite.	1	8
Going back to the well. Interested?	1	8
Dance with me.	1	8
I don't like you like this.	1	8
"Literally, ""With flies. """	1	8
The espresso beans mean health, wealth,	1	8
and, um, happiness.	1	8
Seems redundant,	1	8
I mean, if you already have health and wealth.	1	8
So, are you happy?	1	8
I'm one of those people	1	8
who thinks the minute you ask that, you're not happy, so...	1	8
no.	1	8
You're loud, but you're shy.	1	8
I feel like I'm getting my fortune told.	1	8
I'm sorry.	1	8
Ah, it's fine.	1	8
So what do you want to do?	1	8
Uh... I don't know.	1	8
Maybe break off with one of the writers,	1	8
have my own little shop	1	8
where copy follows art and not the other way around.	1	8
No, I mean my view.	1	8
You have to see it.	1	8
It's all the way to the park.	1	8
Of course it's dark now.	1	8
I don't know.	1	8
May I?	1	8
I...	1	8
don't know what to say.	1	8
It's Elliot.	1	8
And, Salvatore, you don't have to say anything.	1	8
No, I... I just...	1	8
No.	1	8
Have another drink. Think about it.	1	8
Elliot,	1	8
I have thought about it.	1	8
I know what I want.	1	8
I know what I want to do.	1	8
I know what you're thinking.	1	8
I'll show you.	1	8
What are you afraid of?	1	8
Are you joking?	1	8
This... has been a pleasure.	1	8
Don, are you all right?	1	8
I don't know.	1	8
It's always the same thing!	1	8
It's probably the guy in 2F.	1	8
He uses his wife like a speed bag.	1	8
Oh, man.	1	8
I was going to truck down for some carrot juice.	1	8
Wait, wait.	1	8
Thank you.	1	8
Smoke?	1	8
No.	1	8
He speaks.	1	8
I'm supposed to tell you to say your prayers.	1	8
Praying won't help you from this place, kid.	1	8
Best keep your mind on your mother.	1	8
She'll probably look after you.	1	8
She ain't my momma.	1	8
We all wish we were from someplace else, believe me.	1	8
Ain't you heard?	1	8
I'm a whore child.	1	8
No. I hadn't heard anything about that.	1	8
You don't talk like a bum.	1	8
I'm not. I'm a gentleman of the rails.	1	8
For me, every day is brand-new.	1	8
Every day's a brand-new place,	1	8
people, what have you.	1	8
So you got no home.	1	8
That's sad.	1	8
What's at home?	1	8
I had a family once:	1	8
A wife, a job, a mortgage.	1	8
I couldn't sleep at night tied to all those things.	1	8
Then death came to find me.	1	8
Did you see him?	1	8
Only every night.	1	8
So one morning, I freed myself with the clothes on my back.	1	8
Good-bye.	1	8
Now I sleep like a stone:	1	8
Sometimes under the stars, the rain.	1	8
The roof of a barn.	1	8
But I sleep like a stone.	1	8
So where do you go?	1	8
Tomorrow I'll be leaving this place,	1	8
that's for certain.	1	8
If death was coming anyplace, it's here, kid,	1	8
creeping around every corner.	1	8
Here.	1	8
You're an honorary.	1	8
This is how we talk to each other.	1	8
On the front gate of every house, there's a mark.	1	8
It's a code, just like you heard on the radio.	1	8
See...	1	8
That's a pie.	1	8
It means the food here is good.	1	8
This one...	1	8
That means watch out for the nasty dog.	1	8
This one here...	1	8
That means a dishonest man lives here.	1	8
And this one...	1	8
That means tell a sad story.	1	8
Here.	1	8
Don't be scared, kid.	1	8
You ain't a man yet.	1	8
Of course.	1	8
What?	1	8
You two.	1	8
You're in love.	1	8
What?	1	8
That's ridiculous.	1	8
Every day I make pictures where people appear to be in love.	1	8
I know what it looks like.	1	8
Looks like a magazine.	1	8
Love is bourgeois.	1	8
You're breaking my heart.	1	8
Dig. Ad man's got a heart.	1	8
The grownups are talking.	1	8
Don't defend him.	1	8
Toothpaste doesn't solve anything.	1	8
Dacron sure as hell won't bring back those ten dead kids in Biloxi.	1	8
Neither will buying some Tokaj wine	1	8
and leaning up against a wall in Grand Central	1	8
pretending you're a vagrant.	1	8
You know what it's like to watch all you ants go into your hive?	1	8
I wipe my ass with the Wall Street Journal.	1	8
How come every time we have a party,	1	8
the ladies have to sit and listen to the men talk?	1	8
Look at you...	1	8
satisfied,	1	8
dreaming up jingles for soap flakes and spot remover,	1	8
telling yourself you're free.	1	8
Oh, my God. Stop talking.	1	8
Make something of yourself.	1	8
Like you?	1	8
You make the lie.	1	8
You invent want.	1	8
You're for them...	1	8
not us.	1	8
Well, I hate to break it to you,	1	8
but there is no big lie.	1	8
There is no system.	1	8
The universe is indifferent.	1	8
Man, why'd you have to say that?	1	8
Paris.	1	8
Now. Let's go.	1	8
Don.	1	8
No, I can't.	1	8
Buy yourself a car.	1	8
Don.	1	8
The cops.	1	8
You can't go out there.	1	8
You can't.	1	8
Good evening.	1	8
Wake up, Bobby.	1	8
Come on, kiddo.	1	8
Daddy.	1	8
Your sister's sleeping.	1	8
Ask me anything.	1	8
What?	1	8
Anything.	1	8
I'm tired.	1	8
Ask me.	1	8
Uh, why do lightning bugs light up?	1	8
I don't know.	1	8
But I will never lie to you.	1	8
Well, sir, I believe that does it.	1	8
I'll be on my way.	1	8
Thank you, again, for sharing your home.	1	8
Good luck to you.	1	8
Be on your way already.	1	8
Good morning, Peggy.	1	8
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	1	8
Mommy, look at that!	1	9
Hello.	1	9
Don Draper. How are you?	1	9
Probably about like you: Enduring the splendor of Fiorellol	1	9
You know we got that Israeli tourism thing, right?	1	9
Mazel tov.	1	9
I ran into Jim Jordan from BBDO at the Athletic Club	1	9
with, uh, Frank from Y&R.	1	9
Your name came up.	1	9
Three millionaires in towels in a steam room.	1	9
I don't know how to take that.	1	9
 Take it as a compliment,	1	9
a sign that you're destined for greater things.	1	9
"I think ""Jesus Over Rio"" was the best tourist campaign"	1	9
I've seen in over 20 years.	1	9
Wasn't good enough to land the Israelis.	1	9
Ah, that's not you.	1	9
That's the tiny store you work in.	1	9
Now, if you were with me at McCann,	1	9
you'd have over 500 people at your disposal...	1	9
and that's just in New York.	1	9
We can get a lot of things done.	1	9
Can you get me out of the second half of this show?	1	9
All I'm saying is you've done your time in the farm leagues.	1	9
Yankee Stadium is on the line.	1	9
 I changed my mind.	1	9
I decided you deserve a visit to the bar.	1	9
Adele, this is Donald Draper.	1	9
If we're being introduced, I assume that you're in advertising.	1	9
Would you both like to talk about that some more?	1	9
Betty.	1	9
My wife.	1	9
Jim and Adele Hobart.	1	9
Hello. Betty Draper.	1	9
A pleasure.	1	9
Your husband here was about to prove	1	9
that he can speak about things other than advertising.	1	9
Oh, he's very interesting.	1	9
Well, then, come with me.	1	9
Let's get those drinks.	1	9
We'll be back.	1	9
Champagne?	1	9
Besides getting the handsome prince, are you an actress or something?	1	9
No, I'm a housewife.	1	9
I did do some modeling... a lifetime ago.	1	9
I'm not surprised.	1	9
That is some face you've got there.	1	9
Anybody ever tell you you're a dead ringer for Grace Kelly?	1	9
They used to.	1	9
You know what?	1	9
Coca-Cola's deep into this, uh,	1	9
international campaign right now.	1	9
A European face like yours, like Grace Kelly's,	1	9
might be a road we could go down.	1	9
Uh, we could put a call out for a Grace Kelly type,	1	9
but, uh, I don't think we'd come this close.	1	9
You say you've modeled?	1	9
I'm retired.	1	9
This is silly.	1	9
Think about it.	1	9
Your coloring with a green bottle and an Irish setter...	1	9
Oh, drink up.	1	9
It's back to Tammany Hall.	1	9
I like the show.	1	9
Very gay songs.	1	9
Well, we'd better get back in there or leave.	1	9
Come on.	1	9
Uh, it was very nice meeting both of you.	1	9
Why didn't you want to go to dinner with Jim and Adele?	1	9
People like Jim Hobart always talk business	1	9
because they have nothing else to say.	1	9
I can see that.	1	9
You know, he gave me his card.	1	9
Really?	1	9
Did he tell you to put it under my pillow of something?	1	9
No. Actually, he was talking to me about modeling.	1	9
Was he?	1	9
I don't think it was like that.	1	9
He said something about Grace Kelly and Coca-Cola.	1	9
Well, then, there's no need to doubt his interest, then.	1	9
I did model, Don.	1	9
Am I that wrong for Coca-Cola?	1	9
You're not wrong for anything.	1	9
So are you going to go there?	1	9
How was Fiorello exclamation point?	1	9
Lt'll be six months before I can get Don back into a Broadway theater.	1	9
Oh, we ran into this agency head.	1	9
Apparently he's courting Don.	1	9
He gave me his card.	1	9
Asked me if I wanted to do any modeling.	1	9
That's a heck of a line. What did Don say?	1	9
He basically said the man was trying to sleep with one of us	1	9
and that he didn't like the idea of either.	1	9
I did do some modeling, you know.	1	9
I did not know, but I'm not surprised.	1	9
Carlton calls you Grace Kelly.	1	9
I was a model when I met Don.	1	9
A model in Manhattan?	1	9
Yes.	1	9
It was exciting.	1	9
But when I got started...	1	9
the summer after college, in Italy.	1	9
Italy?	1	9
There was this Italian designer: Giovanni.	1	9
He wanted to be called Johnny.	1	9
That's how much he loved Americans.	1	9
Well, he loved American girls.	1	9
It was more of an artist/muse relationship.	1	9
Okay.	1	9
So... he made you all this, and it was platonic?	1	9
No petting, nothing?	1	9
Mamma mia.	1	9
And put my hair up like this.	1	9
And Salvatore said he has the Menken's artwork,	1	9
and to meet him in the art department	1	9
because you're going to need a red pencil.	1	9
Any other good news?	1	9
I think the mail boy dropped that off for you last night.	1	9
Peggy, can you get me an outside line?	1	9
Right away.	1	9
Don Draper.	1	9
Now, why would you call me out of the blue?	1	9
I appreciate the gesture.	1	9
It's not a gesture, Don, it's an overture.	1	9
Let me tell you, you're a hard man to run into.	1	9
I don't know what to say.	1	9
Don't say anything.	1	9
The next step is a quiet rendezvous.	1	9
The Algonquin?	1	9
There's a small hotel.	1	9
Isn't that the song?	1	9
I don't know. I'm...	1	9
I'm not ready to wave the flag just yet.	1	9
What about the details?	1	9
I'd rather do this face-to-face.	1	9
But you already know what you're going to say.	1	9
I don't have to tell you	1	9
the obvious limitations of Sterling Cooper.	1	9
But you're going to.	1	9
Do I need to be careful here?	1	9
It's a mom-and-pop.	1	9
McCann Erickson is an international company.	1	9
We have a network that extends far beyond Madison Avenue:	1	9
Europe, South America.	1	9
We're publicly traded. We issue dividends.	1	9
Small is bad.	1	9
Don,	1	9
do you know the kind of clients we attract?	1	9
Pan Am, Coca-Cola,	1	9
Esso.	1	9
Can you imagine the lifestyle	1	9
that goes with handling Pan Am?	1	9
It's a panty-dropper.	1	9
Television?	1	9
You could be in that in a bigger way.	1	9
You know that.	1	9
What, you want to sell corn?	1	9
We do a show about Indians.	1	9
Imagine yourself in a three-year contract.	1	9
35 per annum, security set in stone.	1	9
Sterling probably hasn't let you break 30 yet.	1	9
No comment.	1	9
I really don't like doing this over the phone.	1	9
All I can say is eventually you come up here,	1	9
or you die wondering.	1	9
He gave me his card right in front of Don.	1	9
Well, not right in front of him, I guess.	1	9
Well, I told Don about it.	1	9
I was a model, you know?	1	9
In fact, I met Don on a photo shoot.	1	9
I was wearing this Russian blue fox coat.	1	9
He was just a copywriter at the fur company.	1	9
I remember	1	9
he saw that I didn't like giving the coat back.	1	9
It's always the hardest part.	1	9
He asked me out.	1	9
He wasn't shy. I liked that.	1	9
I said no.	1	9
Then three weeks later,	1	9
the coat arrived at my apartment.	1	9
Who knows what kind of Indian trading	1	9
he had to do to get it?	1	9
I think I only had two more jobs, maybe three,	1	9
before we got engaged.	1	9
And then I got pregnant.	1	9
It's always a nightmare raising children in Manhattan,	1	9
so we moved to Ossining.	1	9
Suddenly I...	1	9
really felt so old.	1	9
Tell me more about that.	1	9
My mother was very concerned about looks and weight.	1	9
And I've always eaten a lot.	1	9
And I like hot dogs.	1	9
"Mother used to say, ""You're going to get stout. """	1	9
And then I became a model, and she hated it,	1	9
even though Suzy Parker made $100,000 that year.	1	9
My mother hated it.	1	9
Manhattan.	1	9
She called me a prostitute.	1	9
You're angry at your mother.	1	9
What?	1	9
Are you going to talk now?	1	9
You are angry at your mother.	1	9
Of all the things I've said in here.	1	9
You're sitting up.	1	9
You don't listen to me.	1	9
You don't listen to what I say,	1	9
and then out of nowhere you provoke me.	1	9
Tell me more about that.	1	9
I miss her.	1	9
I understand that.	1	9
It's good and bad.	1	9
She wanted me to be beautiful so I could find a man.	1	9
There's nothing wrong with that.	1	9
But then what?	1	9
Just sit and... smoke and...	1	9
let it go till you're in a box?	1	9
I don't care why he gave me his card.	1	9
Where'd you get this?	1	9
Kurt Teasdale over at Gil Bascom.	1	9
It's already on the air.	1	9
They wanted to do it before she had the baby.	1	9
Am I alone? I don't understand it.	1	9
Because it's in Spanish.	1	9
I recognize that finishing school voice.	1	9
You can't govern and listen to that all day.	1	9
I'm happy to give up any Spanish speakers	1	9
and hope this goes away.	1	9
Cooper thinks if Kennedy creeps up any more in the polls,	1	9
Nixon will panic,	1	9
and they'll get desperate for our efforts.	1	9
He wants everything in place.	1	9
More risk.	1	9
Why are we doing this again? And out of pocket?	1	9
I for one don't question the wishes of our clients.	1	9
Clients come and go, Campbell.	1	9
Sometimes it's best to rid them of unrealistic expectations.	1	9
Are you trying to say that we can't win?	1	9
Nixon's got an 8-point lead in the polls.	1	9
Not much.	1	9
And we still haven't figured out a way	1	9
to make an impact about the Nixon campaign's involvement.	1	9
My marching orders were undecided states.	1	9
I think a plan of attack would make Coop happy.	1	9
The 50/50s: Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois.	1	9
Now, it's easy to just say that, isn't it?	1	9
I think women will hate her.	1	9
It's like their better-looking sister marries a handsome senator,	1	9
and she's going to live in the White House.	1	9
I'm practically jealous.	1	9
Hi.	1	9
I called.	1	9
I assumed you were staying in the city.	1	9
The girl.	1	9
We gave her a little extra work, and now she's distracted.	1	9
Look at that.	1	9
It's raw, Don.	1	9
Don, I realized something today.	1	9
I miss modeling.	1	9
You were always telling me you hated it.	1	9
Maybe the passing of time	1	9
has made me... feel differently.	1	9
Maybe it's Jim Hobart.	1	9
So what?	1	9
It's still an opportunity.	1	9
You want to go back to work?	1	9
A few days. I mean, is that so bad?	1	9
I get paid.	1	9
I can get Ethel to watch the kids.	1	9
She watches them half the time now.	1	9
That's three-, four-hour stretches.	1	9
I think it would be fun to go in and be that girl again.	1	9
You're serious?	1	9
There will still be ham.	1	9
I promise.	1	9
Are you resolved?	1	9
Or is this even worth arguing?	1	9
No, it's not like that.	1	9
It's just... something I'd like to do.	1	9
Well, I can't stop you from doing what you want to do.	1	9
You have no idea how boring it is around here.	1	9
Really? I would think one hour on the Sterling Cooper switchboard	1	9
would be a Russian novel.	1	9
They told me it would happen,	1	9
but the truth is you really just stop listening.	1	9
And put ice on your wrists.	1	9
Peggy, do you need to go home?	1	9
What?	1	9
The sweater.	1	9
Are you having one of those days?	1	9
It's not that.	1	9
I'd like to go home,	1	9
but I just don't think I can.	1	9
Then what is it?	1	9
You're not helping your silhouette.	1	9
I ripped my skirt.	1	9
You don't have a needle and thread?	1	9
It's a big rip.	1	9
Oh, honey, I've got a spare outfit squirreled away.	1	9
You can borrow it.	1	9
We're not exactly dressed for that, are we?	1	9
I've lost men like you before.	1	9
It usually had to do with my unexpressed confidence.	1	9
I think you're one in a million, Draper.	1	9
Those are nice clubs.	1	9
That bonus from Cooper must have made you happy.	1	9
It was designed as a kind of an armor against men like Jim Hobart.	1	9
How'd you hear about it?	1	9
I saw those clubs going down the hallway.	1	9
I thought they were for me.	1	9
They're from Jim Hobart.	1	9
What did he offer?	1	9
Bigger.	1	9
The world, basically.	1	9
Well, it can't just be a number on a salary,	1	9
because you know we're open to that.	1	9
Pan Am.	1	9
Pan Am... is not McCann Erickson.	1	9
Big talent attracts big clients.	1	9
We can try and make that happen here.	1	9
- That's true. - But don't be fooled.	1	9
You hear Pan Am, you imagine London,	1	9
holed up at the Dorchester with three stewardesses.	1	9
The truth is it's more like a 20-hour boomerang flight	1	9
so you can make a coupon sing in Spanish.	1	9
And when you have stockholders like McCann does,	1	9
you can't fire clients. I know you'll hate that.	1	9
I thought about leaving once.	1	9
But you know?	1	9
It's daunting.	1	9
Why entertain the prospect of failure?	1	9
That's a sad thought.	1	9
No. It made me look at this place.	1	9
I don't want to sound sentimental,	1	9
but it's not just accounts.	1	9
Look around here at what you have.	1	9
You want to start over?	1	9
I haven't made up my mind.	1	9
I'm taking this very personally.	1	9
Why? It's business.	1	9
Is it?	1	9
McCann Erickson is the major leagues.	1	9
Good. Let him go.	1	9
You're right. Maybe he'll take me with him.	1	9
Can you imagine the money?	1	9
I heard he's making 30 already.	1	9
He's not ten times better than me.	1	9
You love him.	1	9
Everybody loves him.	1	9
Sure. His moods and the way he talks.	1	9
I don't even know what he's saying half the time.	1	9
Clients do.	1	9
I'll admit she crossed my mind once.	1	9
She's having a very bad freshman year.	1	9
They went nuts for her writing.	1	9
Belle Jolie, she did that.	1	9
Belle Jolie was okay.	1	9
She obviously let it go to her head... and other parts of her.	1	9
No, I don't think it's the job.	1	9
I think we're seeing the real her:	1	9
One of those girls who slimmed down before she got here.	1	9
Now she's here, and there she is.	1	9
Who thinks about her?	1	9
Maybe she'll go with Draper, too.	1	9
It's a tragedy.	1	9
Piece of fruit that went real bad real fast.	1	9
And no one ever got to eat it.	1	9
Well, I got some work to do.	1	9
Suddenly upon news of others' success, a young man is filled with ambition.	1	9
Drop dead.	1	9
Harry, you busy?	1	9
Well, hello. I can't believe this.	1	9
I'm sorry. I, uh, overdid it.	1	9
You're out of the business a few years, and things change.	1	9
Please, I'm overwhelmed with the style of you.	1	9
Betty Draper, meet Ronnie Gittridge.	1	9
He handles the art for Coca-Cola.	1	9
He's also my brother-in-law.	1	9
It is a pleasure.	1	9
Look at her. What did I say?	1	9
You ready to work?	1	9
I'm excited.	1	9
It's not that complicated.	1	9
He's either going to tell you to think about something else	1	9
or just stand there.	1	9
Jim thinks everyone else's job is easy.	1	9
Shall we?	1	9
Mrs. Draper,	1	9
it's just a tryout.	1	9
No guarantees.	1	9
I told you I've done this before.	1	9
Now, where did you get that dress?	1	9
So basically,	1	9
whereas Secor previously spent their money	1	9
on local print and radio,	1	9
we increase the network buy to 30%.	1	9
More points for each dollar.	1	9
Secor laxatives.	1	9
You know, I have to talk to those people.	1	9
They're not what you would expect.	1	9
They have absolutely no sense of humor about their product.	1	9
Who knew that college was going to get me out of the army	1	9
and into laxatives?	1	9
College was the moment, wasn't it?	1	9
Fun and games... and girls.	1	9
Were you in a frat?	1	9
Alpha Delta Phi.	1	9
Also known as cutups.	1	9
We were the cutups.	1	9
We had this stray Dalmatian.	1	9
Our mascot Mamie.	1	9
So it died,	1	9
and in classic fraternity manner, we decided to throw a party.	1	9
Mamie's funeral.	1	9
One of the pledges pipes in that our rivals, Psi U...	1	9
They are so gung-ho.	1	9
Psi U is throwing a beauty pageant parade on Main Street	1	9
with the girls' school down the road.	1	9
Now, my friend Chip... he's a lawyer now...	1	9
"says ""Why don't we go down there and get a permit,"	1	9
"throw a grand funeral for Mamie, and let the girls run away crying?"""	1	9
That's great. Did you do it?	1	9
We had police barricades and 30 brothers following that pledge,	1	9
who had the honor of pulling Mamie in a Radio Flyer.	1	9
That's beautiful.	1	9
Idiots.	1	9
Wait a minute.	1	9
Nixon and Kennedy are both buying up air time	1	9
in these undecided states.	1	9
It's an arms race.	1	9
Nixon buys, Kennedy matches.	1	9
So if we can't increase Nixon's presence,	1	9
we can decrease Kennedy's.	1	9
How do we do that?	1	9
We make big buys in New Jersey, Illinois, and wherever	1	9
for Secor laxatives.	1	9
Well, hold on.	1	9
So Nixon's selling laxatives?	1	9
No. We're selling laxatives.	1	9
Nixon's selling Nixon.	1	9
And Kennedy's watching Mamie's funeral.	1	9
This is scary.	1	9
It is.	1	9
Isn't it?	1	9
Even careful mothers can't completely	1	9
protect their families from household germs	1	9
just by cleaning alone.	1	9
That's why you need Lysol.	1	9
Lysol, added to your regular cleaning water,	1	9
eliminates germs that cause odors	1	9
that may cause illness.	1	9
Lysol: Fastest, easiest,	1	9
most effective way to kill household germs...	1	9
It was for me.	1	9
...and lingering odors.	1	9
Who was it?	1	9
I'm the girl. The girl with the cola.	1	9
It's only a couple days' work.	1	9
You know, just a couple of photo shoots and then some kind of testing.	1	9
But I guess you know how it works.	1	9
I do.	1	9
Don't worry. I'm not going to ruin this.	1	9
I'm very happy for you.	1	9
I know you don't like it.	1	9
But I know you're a little bit proud of me.	1	9
Come upstairs.	1	9
No.	1	9
Right here.	1	9
Okay.	1	9
How are these open already?	1	9
Well, Betty, we don't want life to look difficult, now do we?	1	9
You're too much.	1	9
No! No!	1	9
Polly, no!	1	9
Let it go.	1	9
If I see that dog in my yard again,	1	9
I'm going to shoot it.	1	9
I see you got there and back in one piece.	1	9
Yes.	1	9
And even though I got lost,	1	9
I sent Ethel home at 4.	1	9
They went to the park, then to visit Ernie at Francine's.	1	9
All in all, everyone had a nice day.	1	9
So how was it?	1	9
There was this man Ronnie.	1	9
I don't even know what his job is.	1	9
Ronnie Gittridge. He's the art director. I've met him.	1	9
He is such a character.	1	9
He tells funny stories.	1	9
I brought the form home.	1	9
I thought you could help me fill it out	1	9
so I can get paid.	1	9
I'd love to.	1	9
Sweetie pie.	1	9
What happened?	1	9
I had a bad dream.	1	9
Get in bed with Daddy.	1	9
What was your dream?	1	9
I don't want anyone to shoot Polly.	1	9
No one is going to do that, honey.	1	9
Yes. Mr. Brestwood said he would	1	9
because Polly ate one of his doves.	1	9
They're pigeons.	1	9
And he said this to you in your dream?	1	9
No, he said it today when Polly ate the birdie.	1	9
She wasn't hurt that bad. She could fly.	1	9
No one is going to hurt Polly.	1	9
Good night, honey.	1	9
Now they can't play in the yard?	1	9
I'm going to get my robe on	1	9
and go over there and find out what happened.	1	9
2 in the morning.	1	9
He's our neighbor. You'll make it worse.	1	9
I'll talk to him.	1	9
You should have Ethel talk to him.	1	9
Don, they play in the yard when I'm here, too.	1	9
And she didn't tell you?	1	9
I'm sure they didn't tell her.	1	9
They probably wouldn't have told me, either.	1	9
There'll be over at Francine's for the next shoot anyway.	1	9
It's one day.	1	9
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.	1	9
Maybe not.	1	9
She'd never slept well.	1	9
That's not true.	1	9
Did you see those big tears?	1	9
I really want to get a picture of her crying one day.	1	9
I have to say, Don,	1	9
Lucky Strike, even in this lawsuit, is stronger than ever.	1	9
It was a brilliant campaign,	1	9
like some supersonic jet flying right over the market.	1	9
I was there. Great work.	1	9
Thank you.	1	9
Sorry to interrupt. Who is responsible?	1	9
We've made a significant commitment	1	9
for as-yet unproduced Secor laxative commercials.	1	9
This didn't go by me.	1	9
No, it went by Bob Wilkins in Media, right to me.	1	9
Who is responsible?	1	9
Mr. Cooper, sir, it was me.	1	9
You thought of this?	1	9
Well, uh...	1	9
I bear some of the responsibility as well.	1	9
What did they do?	1	9
Every commercial block on air in the Land of Lincoln	1	9
is clogged up with laxative buys.	1	9
And a little bit of Nixon time.	1	9
The Kennedy people won't know what to do with themselves.	1	9
They're going to have to put his pretty face on the radio.	1	9
And with that accent.	1	9
Nicely done.	1	9
I didn't think you had it in you, and I mean that.	1	9
- Thank you. - Thank you.	1	9
Inspired.	1	9
Congratulations, boys.	1	9
Peggy, you want to write that down?	1	9
Don said congratulations.	1	9
Are we done here?	1	9
No.	1	9
I really thought	1	9
it was going to go bad for a minute.	1	9
I was sure it would.	1	9
No kidding. You almost let me detonate	1	9
a thousand feet from the ground.	1	9
So much for camaraderie.	1	9
Mr. Rumsen sent this over.	1	9
Unopened. Very nice.	1	9
Hildy, stay. Have a drink. It's an order.	1	9
No, thank you.	1	9
I'm going to my parents' after work.	1	9
You know, when something good happens to me,	1	9
it also happens to you.	1	9
I know that.	1	9
I said congratulations.	1	9
You should do something with that sour puss.	1	9
You're very beautiful.	1	9
Just being honest.	1	9
I love watching you walk.	1	9
I should go.	1	9
You should.	1	9
Is he in?	1	9
Always nice to see you.	1	9
I'd give you my assurance	1	9
that nothing good will happen to that boy,	1	9
but I can't seem to keep my word on that,	1	9
hard as I try.	1	9
I might ask you to take me with you.	1	9
I see no reason to leave.	1	9
Or maybe I see a million.	1	9
A million? Is that what it's going to cost me?	1	9
I was thinking more like 40.	1	9
45 is good.	1	9
I'm not going to be a little girl and ask you why you stayed.	1	9
I know it's not money,	1	9
and I hope it's not to keep your foot on Pete Campbell.	1	9
I like the way you do business.	1	9
Well, I try to be as civilized as you can be.	1	9
No contract.	1	9
45 and no security.	1	9
What's in it for me?	1	9
If I leave this place one day, it will not be for more advertising.	1	9
What else is there?	1	9
I don't know. Life being lived.	1	9
I'd like to stop talking about it and get back to it.	1	9
I've worked with a lot of men like you,	1	9
and if you had to choose a place to die, it would be in the middle of a pitch.	1	9
I've done that.	1	9
I want to do something else.	1	9
Jim Hobart, McCann Erickson.	1	9
Of course.	1	9
Line 1.	1	9
Don,	1	9
incredible pictures, am I wrong?	1	9
No, you're not.	1	9
So, your wife's already here with us.	1	9
I know she's happy.	1	9
Why don't you join her?	1	9
I don't know about that, Jim.	1	9
You can do better than that.	1	9
You know what I'm offering here?	1	9
It's Yankee Stadium. I know.	1	9
What, did Sterling come to the rescue?	1	9
If this is about money,	1	9
I have to say I might have judged you wrong.	1	9
It's not.	1	9
I'm surprised.	1	9
I thought your wife coming here meant you were interested.	1	9
No, that was her idea.	1	9
Can't blame me for trying.	1	9
Maybe not, but, uh...	1	9
I can't exactly say that was a big league move.	1	9
All's fair. No stone unturned, right?	1	9
It's a pity to lose both of you.	1	9
You're a very lucky man, landing that woman.	1	9
What's going on with Mr. Draper?	1	9
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.	1	9
Very good.	1	9
I've been meaning to give this back to you.	1	9
I had it completely dry cleaned.	1	9
Why don't you keep it?	1	9
Have it taken in here and let out there.	1	9
It's your dress.	1	9
Hot tea. That's a good idea.	1	9
What are you talking about?	1	9
Peggy, you are falling prey to a very common situation for new girls.	1	9
I'm not new anymore.	1	9
Well, that's just it.	1	9
Don't you want to do well here?	1	9
I'm the first girl to do any writing in this office since the war.	1	9
Marge told me.	1	9
Writing?	1	9
Is that what this is about?	1	9
I thought you were doing that to get close to Paul.	1	9
Thank you. Again.	1	9
I heard you were being considered for an account	1	9
because a client's wife saw you	1	9
and thought it would be okay if he worked with you.	1	9
You know, you're not a stick.	1	9
And yet I never wonder what men think of me.	1	9
You're hiding a very attractive young girl with too much lunch.	1	9
I know what men think of you:	1	9
That you're looking for a husband, and you're fun,	1	9
and not in that order.	1	9
Peggy, this isn't China.	1	9
There's no money in virginity.	1	9
I'm not a virgin.	1	9
No. Of course not.	1	9
I just realized something.	1	9
You think you're being helpful.	1	9
Well, I am trying, dear.	1	9
I'm going home.	1	9
Did you have a good day?	1	9
I did. It was splendid.	1	9
Well, Betty, I have some good news and some bad news.	1	9
There's bad news?	1	9
The client's moving the international work to London.	1	9
Oh.	1	9
More Audrey Hepburn, less Grace Kelly.	1	9
I see.	1	9
As for us,	1	9
we're all going back to the malt shop.	1	9
The good news is you have two wonderful sets of pictures	1	9
to start your book again.	1	9
That's true.	1	9
I really am sorry.	1	9
This was fun.	1	9
You can keep the dress and the hairstyle.	1	9
I don't do that for everyone.	1	9
Oh, honey,	1	9
it has nothing to do with you.	1	9
Thank you.	1	9
What do you think, Paul?	1	9
Should we move this whole thing	1	9
down to MacDougal Street?	1	9
We're doing great here.	1	9
It's good she left.	1	9
It probably wasn't going to happen for her tonight.	1	9
It depends how much we drink.	1	9
How drunk do you have to be?	1	9
My brother works at the Exchange.	1	9
They call a girl like her a lobster.	1	9
All the meat's in the tail.	1	9
Are they giving you guys a bonus?	1	9
Would you calm down?	1	9
Come on!	1	9
Drop you at the station?	1	9
Sure.	1	9
Campbell, you sucker-punched me.	1	9
What is wrong with you?	1	9
Come on.	1	9
You just had a fight,	1	9
and I was not part of it.	1	9
Either you two make up, or I do not stand a chance tonight.	1	9
Perfect timing.	1	9
The children are down,	1	9
but only because they were running around all day.	1	9
They fell asleep in front of the TV.	1	9
How did it go today?	1	9
Good. Fun.	1	9
They were talking about a whole string of other possibilities for me.	1	9
But honestly, I don't think I want to work anymore.	1	9
I don't like you coming home to some... whipped-together mess	1	9
of whatever's left in the fridge.	1	9
And frankly, I don't like Manhattan on my own.	1	9
It's harsh.	1	9
It can be.	1	9
And what am I going to do?	1	9
Run around the city with my book,	1	9
like some teenager, making a fool of myself?	1	9
If that's what you want,	1	9
and it's my job to give you what you want.	1	9
You do.	1	9
Look at all this.	1	9
I don't know what I was thinking.	1	9
Birdie, you know I don't care	1	9
about making my dinner or... taking in my shirts.	1	9
You have a job.	1	9
You're mother to those two little people,	1	9
and you are better at it than anyone else in the world.	1	9
At least in the top 500.	1	9
I would have given anything to have had a mother like you.	1	9
Beautiful and kind...	1	9
filled with love like an angel.	1	9
You're sweet.	1	9
And this does not taste whipped-up.	1	9
No. It's good, isn't it?	1	9
Have a good day, Daddy.	1	9
You, too.	1	9
Have a good day.	1	9
We're going to the community center to watch them fill the pool.	1	9
That sounds fun.	1	9
Have a good day.	1	9
I already am.	1	9
Mommy, I'm eating.	1	9
Be careful. Don't jump off the bed.	1	9
Okay!	1	9
Mrs. Draper, what the hell are you doing?	1	9
Mrs. Draper!	1	9

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, running in the house.	1	10

No, no.	1	10
Daddy, have a saccharine or nothing.	1	10
 [Gene] Where is your sugar bowl?	1	10

Grandpa!	1	10
Good morning.	1	10
Good to see you, Gene.	1	10
Don.	1	10
This is my friend Gloria.	1	10
I heard you might be joining us.	1	10
It's good to have another woman around,	1	10
give Betty a break.	1	10
Oh, I live to serve.	1	10
Hey, you heard that, right?	1	10
 I have a witness.	1	10
She's a hell of a sport.	1	10
Don, will you help me with the suitcase?	1	10
We're only going for the weekend.	1	10
I can't get it out of the closet.	1	10

I can imagine everyone at the club.	1	10
"""Was she waiting at the funeral"	1	10
"""unbuttoning her top button"	1	10
"like for some Sadie Hawkins dance?"""	1	10
She seems like a perfectly nice lady.	1	10
What am I supposed to do with this, fill it with hay?	1	10
How far do you want to go with this?	1	10
Oh, I'll say you talked me out of it.	1	10
She's a vulture.	1	10
Her husband was a failure.	1	10
When he died, they found out	1	10
he'd cheated on his income taxes.	1	10
And her kids... Louise never married.	1	10
Two more years and she'll be hanging out at funerals, too.	1	10
Huntley... he was my brother's age.	1	10
"He was always ""funny."""	1	10
Birdie, your father was married, what, 40 years?	1	10
The man can hardly fix himself a cup of tea,	1	10
let alone do laundry.	1	10
All he needs is a housekeeper.	1	10
A housekeeper goes home at night.	1	10
Don.	1	10
Let him have it.	1	10
Ugh. And that fake smile.	1	10
You've been looking forward to the beach.	1	10
Let her cook.	1	10
Let your father put some stones by that wall	1	10
so we stop getting water underneath the deck.	1	10
I guess I won't have to worry about talking to her.	1	10
She never stops.	1	10
Just get through today. [sighs]	1	10
I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.	1	10
We'll go to that place with the lobster rolls.	1	10

about dollars and cents.	1	10
Your dollars and cents.	1	10
Now, my opponents want to increase federal expenditures	1	10
as much as $18 billion a year.	1	10
How will they pay for it?	1	10
There are only two ways.	1	10
One is to raise your taxes.	1	10
Turn it off.	1	10
The other...	1	10
[expels breath]	1	10

I'd say we could run them again,	1	10
but I don't think you want to see them.	1	10
Oh, I've seen them.	1	10
Which reminds me, you people are not	1	10
watching enough television.	1	10
It is your job. The shows and the ads.	1	10
I was just wondering,	1	10
there must be any number of people	1	10
harvesting mud on Johnny Kennedy right now.	1	10
Have we heard anything?	1	10
We hear things. Nothing useful.	1	10
He's a womanizer.	1	10
That's not going to hurt him.	1	10
Women find out about that, it'll push him over the top.	1	10
Nixon is still ahead in the polls.	1	10
Should have never been this close.	1	10
Why do we need to attack when there is a story to tell?	1	10
Kennedy: nouveau riche,	1	10
recent immigrant who bought his way into Harvard.	1	10
And now he's well-bred? Great.	1	10
Nixon is from nothing.	1	10
A self-made man, the Abe Lincoln of California,	1	10
who was Vice President of the United States	1	10
six years after getting out of the Navy.	1	10
Kennedy? I see a silver spoon.	1	10
Nixon? I see myself.	1	10
If we were to run a critical ad,	1	10
there are obvious benefits.	1	10
When you run an ad that's positive,	1	10
you're only convincing people who are already voting for you.	1	10
But when you run an ad that's critical,	1	10
you get a shot at the people on the fence.	1	10
There are a lot of people on the fence.	1	10
Gentlemen, whether the Nixon campaign wants it or not,	1	10
we have to produce a spot that aims a Howitzer at Kennedy's balls.	1	10
I want to hear ideas.	1	10
After the long weekend.	1	10
I agree. Let's go down swinging.	1	10
If we can switch to a conversation about paying clients,	1	10
Menken's is coming in today to sign off on the roll out.	1	10
Father and daughter.	1	10
I get the feeling old Abe Schmenken	1	10
can kill this whole thing.	1	10
Of course, the checks have cleared already,	1	10
but... Don, I want you to go in	1	10
and ride bare-back over Paul here.	1	10
Done.	1	10
And, uh, Don, I want you on your best behavior.	1	10
Excuse me?	1	10
I know she bothers you.	1	10
Miss Holloway, may I?	1	10
I really need to get to the bottom of that.	1	10
Yes, I would like to get a look at those.	1	10
Margaret and Mona are off to Block Island for Labor Day.	1	10
Gone for the weekend	1	10
along with every other wife in town.	1	10
We can go anywhere tonight.	1	10
We can see a Broadway show,	1	10
then sit at any table at The Colony	1	10
with our clothes off if we want to.	1	10
How about a movie?	1	10
Have you seen The Apartment?	1	10
I went last week with Mona and Margaret.	1	10
I heard Shirley MacLaine is good.	1	10
Oh, please.	1	10
A white elevator operator?	1	10
And a girl at that?	1	10
I want to work at that place.	1	10
Oh, I bet you do.	1	10
The way those men treated that poor girl,	1	10
handing her around like a tray of canapes.	1	10
She tried to committed suicide.	1	10
So you saw it, huh?	1	10
Ah, Red, that's not how it is.	1	10
Look, it was crude.	1	10
That's the way pictures are now.	1	10
You see that ridiculous Psycho?	1	10
Hollywood isn't happy unless things are extreme.	1	10
It didn't seem that extreme to me.	1	10
Are we actually going to get in a fight over a movie?	1	10
You know, Mona had a dream once	1	10
where I hit the dog with the car.	1	10
She was mad at me all day, and I never hit the dog.	1	10
We don't even have a dog.	1	10
Why don't I call you later?	1	10
Uh, Joannie...	1	10
Call me soon, because we can go anywhere.	1	10
The new atrium will make the store	1	10
brighter and more vibrant.	1	10
The aisles will be wider,	1	10
spotlighting these new chrome display cases.	1	10
Over here will be a new restaurant...	1	10
An elegant tea room.	1	10
Modern classic signs and champagne linens.	1	10
A tea room is nice, but 30% of my ground floor	1	10
is devoted to the restaurant business?	1	10
Lunch and Shopping: a day of indulgence.	1	10
It's what ladies like.	1	10
Yes, I saw that in the chapter here.	1	10
It's much longer than the little schedule	1	10
that says we have to close our doors	1	10
while it's getting nailed together.	1	10
Three months of construction,	1	10
during which time we build enormous anticipation.	1	10
Like a movie premier.	1	10
The New Menken's.	1	10
You will have a line that first day.	1	10
Even if you have to pay people to stand in it.	1	10
We'll do whatever it takes.	1	10
Mr. Draper, my daughter's presence here	1	10
should let you know that I am not against change.	1	10
And let us assume that this is the most	1	10
"amazing idea in retail since ""buy one get one free."""	1	10
[men chuckle]	1	10
I still don't understand	1	10
why we have to throw out the baby with the water.	1	10
Can't I keep what I have and just build on it?	1	10
Well, honestly, the unpleasant truth	1	10
is you don't have anything.	1	10
Your customers cannot be depended on anymore.	1	10
Their lives have changed.	1	10
They're prosperous.	1	10
Over the years, they've developed new tastes.	1	10
They're like your daughter:	1	10
educated, sophisticated.	1	10
They know full well what they deserve	1	10
and they're willing to pay for it.	1	10
Why would I want to own a store	1	10
that I wouldn't want to shop in?	1	10
Mr. Menken, I don't know if that's true.	1	10
You had no problem abandoning that second-floor hosiery store	1	10
on 7th Avenue for your present location.	1	10
And that's a story you'll be proud	1	10
to tell your grandchildren.	1	10
The only problem is, they won't care.	1	10
As much as Grandpa likes that marble palace,	1	10
I can promise you, they won't.	1	10
They'll look at it and they'll say,	1	10
"""Grandpa, it must have been hard"	1	10
"back in the olden days."""	1	10
[chuckles]	1	10
And it was.	1	10
Everybody's jumping to forget it.	1	10
Excuse me, but this is not some phony story	1	10
you people print in your Fourth of July circulars.	1	10
My father actually started with nothing,	1	10
and he made it into everything we're talking about.	1	10
Who here can say that?	1	10
I meant no disrespect, sir.	1	10
None taken.	1	10
This is the plan, Daddy.	1	10
As you can see, it wasn't just thrown together.	1	10
It does seem very well thought out.	1	10
It is.	1	10
Hmm.	1	10
Pleasure to finally meet you.	1	10
I hope you two know what you're doing.	1	10
Looks like we both get to keep our jobs	1	10
a little while longer.	1	10
Don't screw this up.	1	10
[Don] I think he likes me.	1	10
I guarantee you there is nothing about you he likes.	1	10
What about you?	1	10
Daddy, can we?	1	10
This place reminds me of a Czarist Ministry.	1	10
No matter what the decision, you don't feel it was yours.	1	10
Fortunately, I have no idea what you're talking about.	1	10
He's very good. Persuasive.	1	10
Yes.	1	10
A little... dashing for my taste.	1	10
[elevator dings]	1	10
Carol, it's 10:30.	1	10
Did we have lunch,	1	10
because even I can't leave this early.	1	10
No, I needed to talk to you.	1	10
Why aren't you at work?	1	10
Don't tell me you're late again.	1	10
Do you need to see Dr. Emerson?	1	10
No. Good grief, Joan.	1	10
Then what?	1	10
You walked 12 blocks in a heat wave.	1	10
And I see you didn't take my advice	1	10
about the dress shields.	1	10
You know how Mr. Aldridge has had me reading	1	10
the slush pile?	1	10
Yes, writing the rejection letters.	1	10
You told me. It was depressing.	1	10
I'm so stupid!	1	10
This morning in the submissions meeting,	1	10
the editorial director asks why we haven't responded	1	10
to this poet from Yale, Marlon Rice.	1	10
Mr. Aldridge tells him we never saw it.	1	10
The the director asks me, and I cover for Mr. Aldridge.	1	10
I said that I had read it and rejected it.	1	10
Then they made Mr. Aldridge fire me.	1	10
Oh, honey. That's awful.	1	10
He was really sorry about it.	1	10
Of course. That SOB. I know.	1	10
I'm going to have to ask my dad for more money again.	1	10
It's humiliating. Stop it.	1	10
You shouldn't be embarrassed. There's never enough money.	1	10
You always seem to manage.	1	10
These men.	1	10
We're constantly building them up.	1	10
And for what?	1	10
Dinner, jewelry.	1	10
Who cares?	1	10
We need to go out and shake all this gloominess.	1	10
All I want to do is sit in the movies and cry.	1	10
No movies.	1	10
Let's look for some actual bachelors.	1	10
Empty their wallets.	1	10
I hate Manhattan sometimes.	1	10
Don't say that.	1	10
This city is everything.	1	10
[knocking at door]	1	10
Where's Howdy Dowdy at?	1	10
What can I do for you?	1	10
I just got off the phone with Brett Rowley at Dr. Scholl's.	1	10
Don't tell me they're coming in again	1	10
about the exercise sandals.	1	10
Did you tell them summer's over?	1	10
They're not coming in. Ever.	1	10
They're going to Leo Burnett.	1	10
What? Why didn't he call me?	1	10
Probably because they were disappointed with the creative.	1	10
Rowley called it dull and humorless.	1	10
And what did you say? What could I say?	1	10
I've never lost an account before.	1	10
Especially one that was here before I got here.	1	10
So you really put up a fight?	1	10
He had very strong feelings.	1	10
Said some unpleasant things.	1	10
Which you don't remember or I'm sure you'd tell me.	1	10
The day you sign a client is the day you start losing them.	1	10
Are you going to tell Sterling or should I?	1	10
Unless you think it can wait until after the weekend.	1	10
I'll take care of it.	1	10
Were you buzzing me?	1	10
My intercom was making a funny sound.	1	10
Oh.	1	10
Leave it.	1	10
Do you wear Dr. Scholl's inserts?	1	10
I thought we all had to.	1	10
Take them out.	1	10
Get rid of this, please.	1	10
[door closes]	1	10
[sighs]	1	10
We lost Dr. Scholl's. [metallic clicking]	1	10
Where?	1	10
Leo Burnett.	1	10
Campbell enjoyed telling me	1	10
it was something to do with creative.	1	10
I thought I should tell you.	1	10
Make sure the ink is dry on that raise.	1	10
That fat piece of shit.	1	10
He's a cigarette ash.	1	10
Chicago. What a joke.	1	10
Small time.	1	10
Sorry, maybe you're from there.	1	10
Well, I know I didn't drop the ball on this.	1	10
Sales were steady.	1	10
It probably didn't help that our billings crept up	1	10
for no apparent reason.	1	10
Eventually, an accountant is going to read the mail.	1	10
If you're trying to cheer me up, it's working.	1	10
The day you sign a client is the day you start losing them.	1	10
You don't really believe that.	1	10
You know what my father used to say?	1	10
Being with a client is like being in a marriage.	1	10
Sometimes you get into it for the wrong reasons	1	10
and eventually, they hit you in the face.	1	10
[laughs]	1	10
Damn it.	1	10
Are we supposed to cry about this?	1	10
So we lost an account.	1	10
That means we'll just have to cut back.	1	10
Let's go fire somebody.	1	10
It's Labor Day weekend.	1	10
Between now and Monday we have to fall in love a dozen times.	1	10
Betty's at the shore. I'm headed down tomorrow.	1	10
What do we work so hard for?	1	10
To have enough money to buy fabulous vacations	1	10
for our families so we can live it up here.	1	10
Give me tonight; you owe me that.	1	10
I can use you as bait.	1	10
There's a casting call at 4:00.	1	10
Double-sided aluminum.	1	10
If Freddie Rumsen's brain works	1	10
the way I think it works, slow and obvious,	1	10
I think we should go down to casting	1	10
and see who's on the couch.	1	10
Remember, Don, when God closes a door,	1	10
he opens a dress.	1	10
What do you have there? Precious cargo?	1	10
Mr. Rumsen has me trafficking the Belle Jolie pouch.	1	10
Aren't you a busy beaver?	1	10
Hey, I'm talking to you.	1	10
If you want to see the proofs,	1	10
you'll have to check with Mr. Cosgrove.	1	10
It's his account.	1	10
Look at you. Minister of Protocol.	1	10
So, has Draper talked to Sterling yet?	1	10
You'll have to ask him.	1	10
I'm asking you.	1	10
You should talk to him.	1	10
What's wrong with you?	1	10
Excuse me?	1	10
I'm just trying to do my job	1	10
and you're making it very difficult.	1	10
Peggy, dear.	1	10
I think I understand what this is about.	1	10
But you're not being professional right now.	1	10
I cannot believe I am in this conversation.	1	10
[lower voice] You think this is easy for me?	1	10
I don't know.	1	10
I don't know if you like me or if you don't like me.	1	10
I'm just trying to get along here.	1	10
And every time walk by, I wonder,	1	10
are you going to be nice to me?	1	10
Or cruel. Cruel?	1	10
What am I supposed to say?	1	10
I'm married.	1	10
Yes, I know.	1	10
And I heard all about how confusing that can be.	1	10
Maybe you need me to lay on your couch	1	10
to clear that up for you again?	1	10
That's some imagination you've got.	1	10
Good thing you're a writer now.	1	10
What do you need me for?	1	10
It's incredible.	1	10
I mean, we're just hanging out in the art department	1	10
and you two wander in.	1	10
We thought it was casting.	1	10
I wish it was.	1	10
I'd definitely pick you two.	1	10
I mean, you have such an exquisite look.	1	10
The bones of your face.	1	10
And your sister, my goodness.	1	10
You two look very different	1	10
when you pay attention.	1	10
I have an older brother.	1	10
My neighbors growing up had a dairy,	1	10
and one of the cows gave birth to two calves	1	10
that were attached at the back.	1	10
Then they cut them apart,	1	10
but they always wanted to be together.	1	10
Is that what happened to you two?	1	10
Do you like Ukrainian food?	1	10
Let me ask you something, Draper.	1	10
Do any of these men have anything else to do?	1	10
Just wanted to make sure the girls were, you know...	1	10
Matching?	1	10
Exactly.	1	10
Well, there you have it, Draper...	1	10
Double-sided aluminum	1	10
as envisioned by Sterling Cooper.	1	10

Look at you.	1	10
Roger Sterling.	1	10
Eleanor. Eleanor Ames.	1	10
What a great God that made two of you.	1	10
[girls giggle]	1	10
Oh, what a sweet thing to say.	1	10
Um, Mirabelle.	1	10
This is Donald Draper.	1	10
He's our creative director here.	1	10
What a pleasure to meet you.	1	10
Well, honestly...	1	10
I think we're going to send everyone else home	1	10
and use our authority to say that you two	1	10
are the new faces of Cartwright Double-Sided Aluminum.	1	10
Oh, my God. Thank you.	1	10
I think this calls for a celebration.	1	10
Come on upstairs with us.	1	10
One drink could be fun.	1	10
One last question.	1	10
How many birthdays have you had?	1	10
20.	1	10
How about her?	1	10

Do you love your sister?	1	10
Of course.	1	10
Why don't you show her how much?	1	10
Give her a kiss.	1	10
Right now.	1	10
Why do people always ask us that?	1	10
My God, because it's a beautiful thing.	1	10
[girls laugh]	1	10
Well... I should be heading home.	1	10
Wunderbar. Have a great night.	1	10
You know what? I think we should go, too.	1	10
Oh, come on.	1	10
Nobody's going anywhere.	1	10

That's nice.	1	10

Yeah, I think I like Mirabelle better than Margaret.	1	10

I do carpentry. I'm building a dry sink.	1	10
I love language.	1	10
Words and their ways.	1	10
Well, this is just bad speech.	1	10
I collect it.	1	10
There's this Polish janitor in our building.	1	10
His name is Stash or Stanislaus.	1	10
He's locked me out of my office on more than one occasion.	1	10
One time, he described his bride	1	10
"as ""not speaking real good English."""	1	10

President, Alpine Real Estate.	1	10
It's me, Bets.	1	10
Were you sleeping?	1	10
Not really.	1	10
The kids are in bed with me.	1	10
Gloria and my father made such a big deal	1	10
about having separate bedrooms.	1	10
Listen, Roger had a heart attack.	1	10
What?	1	10
Don, that's terrible.	1	10
Is he going to be okay?	1	10
The doctors basically say they don't know.	1	10
Mona's with him.	1	10
She must be a wreck.	1	10
It's good that you're there.	1	10
About tomorrow... No, I understand.	1	10
[sighs] Well, what happened?	1	10
He was at work.	1	10
He just keeled over.	1	10
It was awful, actually.	1	10
If the kids wouldn't be so heartbroken,	1	10
I'd come home now.	1	10
I don't want to be here.	1	10
You should have seen the two of them	1	10
in the kitchen tonight.	1	10
She was making some pot roast with ketchup	1	10
and my father started hovering behind her, watching,	1	10
like he used to with my mother.	1	10
How can he pretend that she never existed?	1	10
I still pick up the phone sometimes to call her.	1	10
I don't know, Bets.	1	10
I know people say life goes on,	1	10
and it does.	1	10
But no one tells you that's not a good thing.	1	10
Why is that?	1	10
[whispers] I don't know.	1	10
Stop thinking about that.	1	10
I can't.	1	10
I try.	1	10
Do you want me to come up there?	1	10
No. There's nothing you can do.	1	10
Okay. Give Mona my love.	1	10
And, Don...	1	10
make sure you eat something.	1	10
How's he doing?	1	10
Not great.	1	10
What happened?	1	10
I don't know.	1	10
[Announcer, on TV] Every Republican politician wants you to believe	1	10

help elect Senator John F. Kennedy president.	1	10

Let me in.	1	10
Are you okay?	1	10
No.	1	10
You look terrible.	1	10
Can I get a drink?	1	10
Of course.	1	10
Are you happy with the doctors?	1	10
I can have my father make a call.	1	10
I don't know. He's rich.	1	10
They seem to be taking care of him.	1	10
Is he okay?	1	10
You can tell me. I'm not moving the account.	1	10
He's gray and weak.	1	10
His skin looks like paper.	1	10
I'm sorry.	1	10
He's your friend, isn't he?	1	10
What's the difference?	1	10
You don't want to lose him.	1	10
Don, don't.	1	10
What good is that going to do?	1	10
Is this, like, some solar eclipse?	1	10
The end of the world? Just do whatever you want?	1	10
I don't know. You do.	1	10
You're exhausted.	1	10
You need to sleep, that's all.	1	10
I just need to sit down.	1	10
Sit with me.	1	10
Why?	1	10
Because I feel like you're looking	1	10
right through me over there.	1	10
I'm not.	1	10
I don't like feeling like this.	1	10
No one does.	1	10
I remember the first time I was a pall bearer.	1	10
I'd seen dead bodies before.	1	10
I must have been 15. My aunt.	1	10
I remember thinking...	1	10
They're letting me carry the box.	1	10
They're letting me be this close to it.	1	10
No one is hiding anything from me now.	1	10
And I looked over, and I saw all the old people	1	10
waiting together by the grave.	1	10
I remember thinking, I've...	1	10
I've just moved up a notch.	1	10
I've never heard you talk that much before.	1	10
Rachel... What do you want from me?	1	10
You know. I know you do.	1	10
You know everything about me.	1	10
I don't.	1	10
You don't want to do this.	1	10
You have a wife. You should go to her.	1	10
Jesus, Rachel.	1	10
This is it.	1	10
This is all there is, and I feel like it's slipping	1	10
through my fingers like a handful of sand.	1	10
This is it.	1	10
This is all there is.	1	10
That's just an excuse for bad behavior.	1	10
You don't really believe that.	1	10
No.	1	10
Not unless you tell me you want this.	1	10
Yes, please.	1	10
Miss Holloway, I know it's none of my business,	1	10

Don't waste your youth on age.	1	10
Could you? Lobby.	1	10
Do you want one?	1	10
No.	1	10
You told me your mother died in childbirth.	1	10
Mine did, too.	1	10
She was a prostitute.	1	10
I don't know what my father paid her,	1	10
but when she died, they...	1	10
brought me to him and his wife.	1	10
And when I was 10 years old, he died.	1	10
He was a drunk	1	10
who got kicked in the face by a horse.	1	10
She buried him and took up with some other man,	1	10
and I was raised	1	10
by those two sorry people.	1	10

This got kicked over from Ed Baltz at Compton.	1	11
We sent them Firestone last month	1	11
because of our conflict with Goodyear.	1	11
This is how they repaid the favor.	1	11
Look at that.	1	11
I think it's a modified Lionel transformer.	1	11
Well, I never thought I'd say this,	1	11
but what does the research say?	1	11
Weight loss is a hard thing to prove.	1	11
"No, it isn't. It's ""before"" and ""after"" pictures"	1	11
since the dawn of time.	1	11
Mr. Martin Buckwald, its inventor,	1	11
he calls it the P.E.R.,	1	11
or Passive Exercise Regime.	1	11
[Don] So it needs a name.	1	11
The Electrocizer.	1	11
For a slimmer, better you.	1	11
That helps a little.	1	11
Regarding slimmer,	1	11
Buckwald has a fair amount of testimonials,	1	11
but unfortunately none you can take a picture of.	1	11
We tried to get our own testimonials.	1	11
Some of the fellas brought it home to their wives.	1	11
And?	1	11
It's tricky. I, uh, gave it to Jennifer.	1	11
She took it the wrong way.	1	11
She told me to wear it.	1	11
[laughter]	1	11
Violet has it.	1	11
She says the scales are the same,	1	11
but she hasn't given up on it	1	11
like she does with diets after a week.	1	11
Mitch and some of the other guys...	1	11
We had eight belts.	1	11
Again, there's been no weight loss yet.	1	11
Who cares if it works?	1	11
They're offering us commission on media,	1	11
plus a bounty on every unit upside of last year's comps.	1	11
But fake weight loss claims?	1	11
[knock on door]	1	11
Thank you. Mm-hmm.	1	11
What about her?	1	11
She's obviously losing some kind of battle.	1	11
You may have to let it out a little.	1	11
Maybe you should put her on your regimen	1	11
of sprinting out the door every day at 5 to 5.	1	11
What I'm saying is she did a heck of a job on Belle Jolie.	1	11
Maybe lightning will strike twice.	1	11
I don't think Peggy's the answer.	1	11
I promised Buckwald we'd go with our big guns.	1	11
Our big guns have been silent.	1	11

I need 3.59 for the phone bill.	1	11
I told you I never use it.	1	11
But you do use the saltines	1	11
and the Velveeta and the liverwurst.	1	11
I never even got any.	1	11
I had some people over	1	11
while you were out drinking on Tuesday.	1	11
3.59. That's your half of the phone.	1	11
You should use it more.	1	11
I have work to do.	1	11
I don't know why you do that.	1	11
When I leave the office, I'm done.	1	11
[machine hums]	1	11
Oh!	1	11
[machine stops]	1	11
[floorboards creak]	1	11
Do you have to go home?	1	11
No.	1	11
Good. I don't want you to.	1	11
I don't want to.	1	11
This is hard for me.	1	11
Mostly because I can't even imagine	1	11
how hard it must be for you.	1	11
I don't think about it.	1	11
I mean, I try not to.	1	11
Must be a powerful mind you have there,	1	11
because I can't control mine.	1	11
I keep thinking about us being together.	1	11
We are together.	1	11
I know, but...	1	11
I don't know if I understand how this works,	1	11
where it goes.	1	11
I'm worried it's a fantasy.	1	11
It's not.	1	11
I told you, I'm right where I'm supposed to be.	1	11
I just haven't figured out what to do yet.	1	11
I'm sorry. Would you like me to wait outside?	1	11
It's up to you.	1	11
I, um, I did the work on the weight loss belt,	1	11
like you asked.	1	11
That was fast.	1	11
You asked me to.	1	11
And what is your unique point of view?	1	11
I wrote it down.	1	11
Summarize.	1	11
It's one day. I don't know if I lost any weight.	1	11
Do you feel different?	1	11
I wrote it down.	1	11
Peggy, you're saying even less in here than you are now.	1	11
It's hard to put into words.	1	11
Then you have failed.	1	11
You definitely feel something	1	11
that I think some women...	1	11
would like to feel.	1	11
Huh.	1	11
Where is that here?	1	11
It vibrates.	1	11
And that coincides with how you wear it.	1	11
Oh. I see that here:	1	11
"""a sensation."""	1	11
Yes.	1	11
It explains its success.	1	11
And it basically made me think	1	11
it was probably... unrelated to weight loss.	1	11
We now have a benefit.	1	11
And we just have to figure out how to put it into words.	1	11
Have another go at it.	1	11
I will work on that, Mr. Draper.	1	11
Peggy, just think about it deeply.	1	11
Then forget it,	1	11
and an idea will... jump up in your face.	1	11
Thank you.	1	11
[doorbell rings]	1	11
[Man] Excuse me, ma'am.	1	11
I hate to bother you.	1	11
I'm from the Frederick Air Conditioning Company,	1	11
and I'd like to talk to you	1	11
about an opportunity	1	11
to live in frozen comfort.	1	11
I'm not interested.	1	11
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?	1	11
It's a scorcher out here.	1	11
Uh...	1	11
I...	1	11
Of course.	1	11
Thank you.	1	11
Ahem.	1	11
Thank you.	1	11
You know, we have many units	1	11
in all price ranges.	1	11
What?	1	11
I'm married to a salesman.	1	11
And I'm sure my husband and I	1	11
can brave another week	1	11
or however long this Indian summer's going to be.	1	11
Can I come back when he is here?	1	11
I mean, a unit here	1	11
or in your living room...	1	11
We wouldn't even have to alter your window.	1	11
We could just cut a hole right above it.	1	11
You see this gap?	1	11
That's where your cool air, whatever there is of it,	1	11
is escaping.	1	11
From that little space?	1	11
Yes. And there's a science	1	11
to how heat patterns work.	1	11
Now, what you need is a unit here downstairs	1	11
and one in your bedroom.	1	11
That's if you have the right construction.	1	11
That would be nice.	1	11
I could take down some numbers,	1	11
you know, measure everything.	1	11
Write up an estimate...	1	11
Something you could discuss with your husband	1	11
when he comes home.	1	11
I guess that would be okay.	1	11
You know...	1	11
my husband...	1	11
I think he would rather go to Sears.	1	11
If that's what you want.	1	11
You should go.	1	11
I can just guess what this would cost	1	11
and put it on your door for your husband.	1	11
Please go.	1	11
[door closes]	1	11
Fernando, we are pleased to hear	1	11
that case sales have more than doubled.	1	11
We still believe that most of the credit	1	11
goes to your rum.	1	11
Say hello from me.	1	11
Bert Cooper says	1	11
it is a unique pleasure working with you.	1	11
I just finished trying to talk Lucky Strike off a ledge.	1	11
Junior or Senior?	1	11
Senior. He's coming for lunch tomorrow	1	11
to see if Roger is still involved.	1	11
And they're having this lunch bedside, I suppose?	1	11
I invited him here to see for himself.	1	11
He called my bluff.	1	11
Clear tomorrow.	1	11
I need you to, uh,	1	11
draw focus from our guest of honor.	1	11
Was number 2 in his class at Columbia Law School.	1	11
He works with Morgenthau,	1	11
and having been captivated by him	1	11
at more than one cocktail party,	1	11
he is a charmer.	1	11
I can see he does something for you,	1	11
but I don't know if this is the right time.	1	11
Because you're getting so much younger every day?	1	11
Because I don't know if my heart would be in it.	1	11
Are you seeing that goy?	1	11
A little bit.	1	11
Well, I told you I wouldn't let that stop me.	1	11
What if he were, um...	1	11
You're mumbling.	1	11
What if he were married?	1	11
My goodness.	1	11
Jesus.	1	11
Nothing's happened.	1	11
Good.	1	11
But I have been thinking about it.	1	11
The two of us together.	1	11
It feels so natural. I feel so close to him.	1	11
Really?	1	11
He's married, but I don't think he's happy.	1	11
Obviously.	1	11
What does it matter? Nothing's going to happen.	1	11
All I know is what I see in the movies.	1	11
It's magical, and then they start talking about him leaving his wife,	1	11
and then he doesn't.	1	11
I saw this one where the husband gets the woman pregnant	1	11
so he kills her.	1	11
You don't want to be that woman.	1	11
Go ahead.	1	11
Oh, please. Whatever it says	1	11
is going to seem related to this.	1	11
"""You are your own worst enemy."""	1	11
That's yours.	1	11
You look tired.	1	11
I am.	1	11
You're working too much.	1	11
No, it's just...	1	11
Maybe.	1	11
It's too hot in here anyway.	1	11
[mutters]	1	11
You know, we're losing a lot of our cool air	1	11
through the windows in the dining room?	1	11
What?	1	11
Nothing. It's just something the salesman said.	1	11
What was he doing in the dining room?	1	11
What are you talking about?	1	11
You let a stranger in my house?	1	11
Don't raise your voice.	1	11
I damn well will raise my voice.	1	11
Do you have any idea what could have happened?	1	11
I could have bought an air conditioner.	1	11
It's hot.	1	11
Salesmen go into people's homes every day.	1	11
It's like when you turn on a television set	1	11
and then you turn it off, it...	1	11
Look, you didn't want to spend the money...	1	11
Good night, Betty.	1	11
I feel like I should make a speech.	1	11
Get back to work.	1	11
Welcome back. You look good.	1	11
Honey.	1	11
One hour. That's all you get.	1	11
You be a good boy.	1	11
I shall be both dog and pony.	1	11
Come on.	1	11
He looks like death.	1	11
I know. His hair and his skin are the same color.	1	11
Not really.	1	11
That's the spot...	1	11
Exactly where it happened.	1	11
[sigh] I can still feel it.	1	11
[knock on door]	1	11
Oh.	1	11
Miss Holloway, we brought you here	1	11
because of your discretion.	1	11
Can you help us with this? His color?	1	11
Hey, honey.	1	11
Well, you know, we don't need Miami Beach,	1	11
but, uh, just do what you can do.	1	11
Can I kiss you?	1	11
I don't know if I could handle it.	1	11
We should have done this for Nixon before the debates.	1	11
Oh, the arrogance of that campaign.	1	11
It's infuriating.	1	11
Being the incumbent is even harder.	1	11
You can't just sit on your ass and look presidential.	1	11
You probably shouldn't get so upset.	1	11
It's not good for you.	1	11
I missed you.	1	11
You know that, right?	1	11
I missed you, too.	1	11
Oh, Joannie, Joannie, look at that mouth.	1	11
You're not doing my lips.	1	11
My rouge is too dark,	1	11
but I have this light lipstick.	1	11
You'll draw freckles on me, too, like Raggedy Andy?	1	11
Look, I want to tell you something	1	11
because you're very dear to me,	1	11
and I hope you understand it comes from the bottom	1	11
of my... damaged, damaged heart.	1	11
You are the finest piece of ass I ever had,	1	11
and I don't care who knows it.	1	11
I am so glad I got to roam those hillsides.	1	11
Stop it.	1	11
I mean it.	1	11
I've had a lot of time	1	11
to think about the things I've done	1	11
and been sorry about,	1	11
and being with you is not one of them.	1	11
[whispering] Oh, Red.	1	11
That's not what I wanted.	1	11
You look better.	1	11
I should have come over.	1	11
That's a silly idea.	1	11
Damn it.	1	11
Soon the milk stains are going to meet the sweat stains.	1	11
Should we get out of here and let her sleep?	1	11
I'd love to, but the door's noisier than our talking.	1	11
She's actually a good sleeper, thank God,	1	11
even with the heat rash.	1	11
Poor thing.	1	11
And it actually gets hotter at night.	1	11
Did you think about buying an air conditioner	1	11
from that pushy young man yesterday?	1	11
Is that what he was selling?	1	11
He looked like one of Carlton's squash buddies.	1	11
Made me sorry I answered the door.	1	11
He was very pushy.	1	11
He came in and started measuring things.	1	11
Don was not happy about that.	1	11
Don was there?	1	11
No.	1	11
Carlton would break my arm.	1	11
It was foolish letting him in.	1	11
Why would you tell him?	1	11
It just came up.	1	11
I wasn't thinking.	1	11
What did he do?	1	11
What do you think?	1	11
He lost his temper.	1	11
He's very protective.	1	11
Just as you requested,	1	11
a little of our local color:	1	11
pastrami, cole slaw, sour pickles.	1	11
Uh-huh. I like it.	1	11
It's Yankee barbecue.	1	11
Yeah.	1	11
Uh-huh.	1	11
They're all ours.	1	11
[Cooper] Here they are now.	1	11
Roger. Hello, Lee.	1	11
Hello, Don. Lee. Preston.	1	11
Jimmy, Preston, how do you do?	1	11
It's wonderful to see you.	1	11
Well, from what I hear,	1	11
you boys had all but given me up for dead.	1	11
I don't think it's wrong	1	11
for us to express our concern	1	11
for your well-being.	1	11
Well, I know how much you love your delicatessen.	1	11
But I know there's also something else	1	11
you want to discuss.	1	11
You're worried about losing the lawsuit?	1	11
There were no damages.	1	11
But we lost.	1	11
But there were no damages.	1	11
Blame is one thing, malice is another.	1	11
I worked my way inside and out of the FTC.	1	11
Bought a lot of dinners in Washington.	1	11
You can't fight them.	1	11
That's what lawyers are for.	1	11
Lawyers? I've seen a girl fight harder on her first date	1	11
than these DC shuttlecocks.	1	11
[laughter]	1	11
Listen, I'm a stockholder,	1	11
so I called Chester Conrad	1	11
in the Surgeon General's office,	1	11
and he assured me it would be at least three years	1	11
before they could compile a report.	1	11
But legislation is in progress.	1	11
We hear another year or two beyond that.	1	11
They speculate they're going to put warning signs on the packages.	1	11
There's still plenty of time	1	11
before we have to worry about that,	1	11
during which we wait to see if share drops off	1	11
before we run for the hills looking for a new campaign.	1	11
Is that true?	1	11
Well, it must be. He just said it.	1	11
Well, I've been spending a lot of time with my wife.	1	11
I'm glad we came by.	1	11
I missed you all.	1	11
You New Yorkers.	1	11
To New Yorkers.	1	11
May they always... Ohh!	1	11
Aah!	1	11
Oh, Jesus. Not again.	1	11
[Cooper] Are you okay?	1	11
[Don] Just give him some air. Give him some air.	1	11
Give him air.	1	11
[groaning]	1	11
I'm okay. Don't talk.	1	11
This was stupid. I'll get the elevator.	1	11
No, they're holding the elevator.	1	11
I'm very sorry.	1	11
Mona, sweetheart, this was a mistake.	1	11
I tried to talk him out of it, but you people.	1	11
Mrs. Sterling, I had no idea.	1	11
I used to think you couldn't put a value on a human life,	1	11
but I never asked Bert Cooper, did I?	1	11
Sweetheart...	1	11
Go to hell, Bert.	1	11
I don't need to tell you	1	11
that Don has everything under control.	1	11
I don't know.	1	11
Without Sterling...	1	11
I may have a family business,	1	11
but I'm not an autocrat.	1	11
I have a board,	1	11
and my son wants to be the executive	1	11
of an aluminum company.	1	11
Ah, still, your board should give credit	1	11
where credit is due.	1	11
Share?	1	11
We all like Don Draper,	1	11
but if I was you, I'd find some way to show him	1	11
that you all do, too.	1	11
He's a dead man, you know, even if he survives.	1	11
What are you talking about?	1	11
Most clients will put up	1	11
with one coronary from a partner.	1	11
Cost of doing business. Two?	1	11
Are we going down?	1	11
I wrote, prepared, and sent out my resume this afternoon,	1	11
at company expense.	1	11
Look, it doesn't take a genius	1	11
to see what's going to happen.	1	11
They'll bump Draper up to partner.	1	11
Everyone will fall in line.	1	11
Draper.	1	11
It would have happened a long time ago	1	11
if they weren't so greedy.	1	11
They're already paying him his weight in gold.	1	11
Half the accounts at this agency came for Draper.	1	11
Frank Birmingham brings in a lot of accounts.	1	11
Come on. You sit in that conference room.	1	11
Frank Birmingham brings them in,	1	11
and while they're dozing off,	1	11
Don goes through their wallets.	1	11
What about Mitch Sullivan in Media?	1	11
He's fat, bald, and charmless.	1	11
You think Draper likes me?	1	11
He rides me pretty hard sometimes.	1	11
It's hard to tell with him.	1	11
He likes you.	1	11
I work at it.	1	11
I work at it, too.	1	11
I can tell you do.	1	11
You never know when he's doing it.	1	11
There's not a man in this room	1	11
who's not holding Don Draper on their shoulders	1	11
so that he can reach partner.	1	11
He's not going to fire you.	1	11
Who said anything about that?	1	11
No one. It's just...	1	11
You don't think he deserves it, do you?	1	11
Campbell, don't you know anything about business,	1	11
cleaning out the old guys?	1	11
It's good for us. It opens up spots.	1	11
My ma, she wouldn't shut up about you.	1	11
I told her I remembered you.	1	11
Isn't that nice?	1	11
You smoke.	1	11
All the time.	1	11
It's practically mandatory in our office.	1	11
[cough]	1	11
Thank you.	1	11
Brandy Alexander for La Donna,	1	11
and a Rheingold.	1	11
What, you don't like it? I'll send it back.	1	11
Well, my friend Joan always orders them for me.	1	11
They're usually sweeter.	1	11
Hmm.	1	11
She's a scream.	1	11
She lives in the city.	1	11
There's a bar in Manhattan where the glasses are chilled.	1	11
Hmm.	1	11
What's in that?	1	11
I don't know.	1	11
So you drive a truck.	1	11
Yes.	1	11
But I bought my own route.	1	11
Wise potato chips.	1	11
Really?	1	11
Yeah.	1	11
I have an area that's just mine.	1	11
The route was expensive,	1	11
but the hard part was learning that truck.	1	11
Special license.	1	11
We have a potato chip account:	1	11
Utz.	1	11
You get free ones? I do.	1	11
I don't know. I don't like potato chips.	1	11
You live out here, right?	1	11
Prospect Park. I have my own apartment.	1	11
Well, I share it with my roommate Marjorie.	1	11
She's a character.	1	11
My sister's a secretary for Bulova in Flushing.	1	11
I just got a new account the other day.	1	11
I already wrote copy for Belle Jolie lipsticks.	1	11
It's going to be in a bunch of magazines.	1	11
Which ones?	1	11
I don't think you read them.	1	11
They're about high fashion.	1	11
Advertising doesn't work on me.	1	11
It's just a lot of people screaming at you	1	11
from the walls and the TV.	1	11
If advertising is good, people never think it works.	1	11
How do they know it does?	1	11
Did they ever prove that?	1	11
Why are you insulting what I do?	1	11
"""So you drive a truck."""	1	11
You do.	1	11
I'm my own boss, you know?	1	11
You get off the train every day at Grand Central,	1	11
and they spray you with gold?	1	11
Let me tell you,	1	11
you can act like you're from Manhattan,	1	11
but you don't look like those girls.	1	11
Hey, hold on.	1	11
That wasn't nice.	1	11
I feel sorry for you.	1	11
I said I'm sorry.	1	11
Those people? In Manhattan?	1	11
They are better than us,	1	11
because they want things they haven't seen.	1	11
[Announcer] The Danny Thomas Show	1	11
was brought to you tonight by Post cereals.	1	11
All fine products of General Foods.	1	11
Post cereals.	1	11
And now...	1	11
[TV shuts off]	1	11
I'll be up. I want to check on Roger.	1	11
Okay.	1	11
[ring]	1	11
Hello.	1	11
Hello. It's Don Draper.	1	11
What can I do for you?	1	11
I don't know what you do for anybody.	1	11
Mr. Draper, you sound hostile.	1	11
After hundreds of dollars,	1	11
all you've managed to do is make her more unhappy.	1	11
I understand this is frustrating for you.	1	11
This has nothing to do with me. It's her.	1	11
You took a woman with a bad case of nerves,	1	11
and you made her weaker, not stronger.	1	11
I'm afraid to leave her alone.	1	11
All I can say is that it's a process,	1	11
and time is part of it.	1	11
If you'd like to expedite things,	1	11
we can put her in psychoanalysis.	1	11
What are you doing now?	1	11
Psychoanalytic psychotherapy.	1	11
Psychoanalysis would mean a minimum	1	11
of three sessions a week and optimally five.	1	11
Thank you.	1	11
I'll think about that.	1	11
Over there.	1	11
There's no chair.	1	11
I really wish I could have come in and prepared first.	1	11
Sorry. This is the way it works.	1	11
Of course.	1	11
I only have one and a carbon.	1	11
That's all I had time to do. You'll have to share.	1	11
Come on. Just give it to one of the girls.	1	11
Ready when you are.	1	11
Women lose weight so they'll feel good about themselves:	1	11
healthier, more attractive.	1	11
Rejuvenate has a Latin root	1	11
"which literally means ""the return of youth."""	1	11
The Rejuvenator gives you the flush and glow	1	11
not only that you might have after hours of exercise	1	11
but certainly as a young girl.	1	11
Isn't it nice to feel that way whenever you want?	1	11
Combined with a sensible diet,	1	11
The Rejuvenator.	1	11
You'll love the way it makes you feel.	1	11
Look, I'm not going to wait	1	11
to see how Don lands on this.	1	11
I'm going to tell you it's good.	1	11
Nice end run around the weight loss.	1	11
I think it's good, too. But what does it do?	1	11
From what I understand,	1	11
it provides the pleasure of a man	1	11
without the man.	1	11
[snickering]	1	11
We've been replaced?	1	11
That's why Mitch's wife didn't want to take it off.	1	11
Oh, I'd love to see her in that.	1	11
Oof, she's already so hot to trot.	1	11
4th of July, that gingham halter	1	11
with the knot at the bottom?	1	11
She was falling out of it.	1	11
Jayne Mansfield.	1	11
[laughter]	1	11
Mitch's wife is very attractive.	1	11
Oh, I... I don't know her.	1	11
First of all, no Latin.	1	11
You sound like a valedictorian.	1	11
And the name still isn't right.	1	11
Lastly, you still might need to give us a hint	1	11
at what it does.	1	11
I could be more explicit.	1	11
I was thinking of calling it stimulating.	1	11
I think you need, like, a code word,	1	11
uh, like... I don't know.	1	11
Like refreshing.	1	11

I'm not.	1	12
I'm hoping you'll realize	1	12
that this all can be forgotten.	1	12
It's not like you're a deserter, is it?	1	12
When you threaten someone in this manner,	1	12
you should be aware of the fact	1	12
that if your information is powerful enough	1	12
to make them do what you want...	1	12
what else can it make them do?	1	12
It's very simple.	1	12
And it's not a threat. It's just a job.	1	12
Think about it.	1	12
Whitman.	1	12
Yes, Sergeant.	1	12
What is this?	1	12
This is it.	1	12
[scoffs]	1	12
One? I'm supposed to have 20.	1	12
This is going to take a month,	1	12
and it should take 48 hours.	1	12
Well, you're whining to the wrong guy, sir.	1	12
[distant gunfire]	1	12
At ease.	1	12
Uh, this is for officers.	1	12
You can bunk next door.	1	12
I-I'd introduce you to the men,	1	12
but you're looking at the complete company.	1	12
Where is everybody, sir?	1	12
They were gone when I got here.	1	12
I'm an engineer.	1	12
They're in some action 5 miles over that mountain.	1	12
You want to go?	1	12
The answer is no.	1	12
The locals stopped showing up three days ago,	1	12
which, by the way, is not good.	1	12
You're going to be doing all the digging.	1	12
Digging what?	1	12
Well, this unit... that's you...	1	12
Will be establishing a field hospital,	1	12
but first we're going to be digging fighting positions	1	12
on four sides.	1	12
What are you doing here? Are you poor?	1	12
I volunteered.	1	12
You're kidding me.	1	12
Well, they got me with college.	1	12
But I'm three years, six months nearly a civilian.	1	12
I'm supposed to be building swimming pools,	1	12
not latrines.	1	12
You any good with that rifle?	1	12
I wouldn't want you to mistake me for Chinese.	1	12
As much practice as I've had, yes.	1	12
What misconception traveled down the road	1	12
and made you want to be here?	1	12
A movie?	1	12
No. I just wanted to leave.	1	12
I'll bet you're reconsidering if this was a step up.	1	12
Miss Menken,	1	12
Mr. Draper is here to see you.	1	12
Please hold my calls.	1	12
Did you run over? You're flushed.	1	12
Let's go away.	1	12
Really? Where?	1	12
Anywhere.	1	12
Warmer weather?	1	12
Sure.	1	12
How about Los Angeles?	1	12
Mexico? I have money.	1	12
I have money, but I have a store to run.	1	12
Don, are you well?	1	12
No, I'm not.	1	12
Did something else happen to Roger?	1	12
No.	1	12
Something happened, and...	1	12
I want to go, and I want you to come with me,	1	12
and I don't want to come back.	1	12
What happened?	1	12
What does it matter? Isn't this what you want?	1	12
Of course. I've thought about it.	1	12
My God, we've talked about it.	1	12
I just...	1	12
I just didn't think it would happen...	1	12
I mean, especially this way.	1	12
I just... don't want to be without you,	1	12
and I don't want to be here.	1	12
I can't just leave.	1	12
Maybe this weekend...	1	12
Rachel.	1	12
No. This isn't how I thought it would be.	1	12
What is the difference?	1	12
We'll go somewhere else.	1	12
We'll start over like Adam and Eve.	1	12
What, are you 15 years old?	1	12
My father...	1	12
Can't we be together here?	1	12
There's nothing here.	1	12
What about your children?	1	12
I'll provide for them.	1	12
And live in Los Angeles?	1	12
My God, you haven't thought this through.	1	12
I feel sick.	1	12
You're wrong. I know exactly what I want.	1	12
You want your children to go on without a father?	1	12
You know how that felt.	1	12
Are you having an attack of conscience after all this?	1	12
No. I'm watching you talk	1	12
because I feel I don't know you.	1	12
You know more about me than anyone.	1	12
You won't even tell me what happened.	1	12
Why are you doing this to me?	1	12
What kind of man are you?	1	12
Go away, drop everything, leave your life?	1	12
People do it every day.	1	12
This was a dalliance, a cheap affair. Rachel, don't.	1	12
You don't want to run away with me.	1	12
You just want to run away.	1	12
You're a coward.	1	12
Please go now.	1	12
Get out.	1	12
[door closes]	1	12
Peggy, this is my office.	1	12
Does this door mean nothing to you?	1	12
I'm sorry, Mr. Draper.	1	12
I didn't know you were coming back. I just...	1	12
I just...	1	12
Calm down.	1	12
Stop it.	1	12
I didn't mean to yell at you.	1	12
Got to be some semblance of privacy left here.	1	12
I had to get away from them all for a minute.	1	12
Drink this.	1	12
Sonny from the elevator	1	12
and some janitor... I don't know his name...	1	12
They got fired.	1	12
That's why you're crying?	1	12
It was my fault.	1	12
I called security.	1	12
They weren't even here last night.	1	12
Peggy, I need to be alone right now.	1	12
I know.	1	12
I know.	1	12
I don't understand.	1	12
I try to do my job.	1	12
I follow the rules,	1	12
and people hate me.	1	12
Innocent people get hurt, and...	1	12
And other people...	1	12
People who are not good...	1	12
Get to walk around doing whatever they want.	1	12
It's not fair.	1	12
Finish it.	1	12
I've thought about what you said.	1	12
Glad to hear it.	1	12
And then I thought about you	1	12
and what a deep lack of character you have.	1	12
I can understand your frustration, Don.	1	12
Believe me, I'm not enjoying this any more than you are.	1	12
I'm hiring Duck Phillips.	1	12
Don...	1	12
don't make me go to Cooper.	1	12
I'm not making you do anything.	1	12
You haven't thought this through.	1	12
I have. Really?	1	12
You're just going to go up to the office	1	12
and tell Bert Cooper.	1	12
If I have to. I don't want to.	1	12
Let me ask you.	1	12
How do you think he'll react	1	12
when you tell him this story of yours?	1	12
You expect him to promote you	1	12
after the way you've behaved?	1	12
I think he'll appreciate the loyalty.	1	12
You haven't thought this through.	1	12
I don't know.	1	12
But I'm pretty sure you won't be working here anymore.	1	12
What are you doing? Where are you going?	1	12
I'm going to take care of this right now.	1	12
Is this like in the movies where I have a gun	1	12
and you don't think I'm going to shoot you?	1	12
I will shoot you.	1	12
I won't let you hold this over my head.	1	12
So you'd rather blow yourself up	1	12
than make me head of accounts.	1	12
Why can't you give me what I want?	1	12
I've earned this job. I deserve it.	1	12
Why? Because your parents are rich?	1	12
Because you went to prep school	1	12
and have a $5.00 haircut?	1	12
You've been given everything.	1	12
You've never worked for anything in your life.	1	12
For gosh sakes, don't you realize	1	12
you're going to lose everything?	1	12
I'm giving you a way out.	1	12
Would it be so bad?	1	12
Why is this so hard for you?	1	12
You're really going to do this?	1	12
More bad news?	1	12
If you came here to drown your sorrows,	1	12
I'm not really much of a drinker.	1	12
No. I just wanted to say...	1	12
I'm pulling the trigger on Duck Phillips	1	12
as new head of account services.	1	12
Oh, good. Well done.	1	12
What?	1	12
I have to bring this up to you.	1	12
Only because I believe if I kept it from you	1	12
in the end it would be damaging to Sterling Cooper.	1	12
It has come to my attention,	1	12
completely by accident,	1	12
that Donald Draper here is not who he says he is.	1	12
His real name is Dick Whitman,	1	12
but... Dick Whitman died in Korea ten years ago.	1	12
It stands to reason that he is a deserter at the very least	1	12
and who knows what else.	1	12
Mr. Campbell,	1	12
who cares?	1	12
What?	1	12
Who cares?	1	12
Mr. Cooper, he's a fraud and a liar.	1	12
A criminal, even.	1	12
Even if this were true, who cares?	1	12
This country was built and run	1	12
by men with worse stories	1	12
than whatever you've imagined here.	1	12
I'm not imagining anything.	1	12
The Japanese have a saying:	1	12
a man is whatever room he is in,	1	12
and right now Donald Draper is in this room.	1	12
I assure you,	1	12
there's more profit in forgetting this.	1	12
I'd put your energy into bringing in accounts.	1	12
Don,	1	12
fire him if you want.	1	12
But I'd keep an eye on him.	1	12
One never knows how loyalty is born.	1	12
Shit!	1	12
Sir, what do we do?	1	12
Keep your head.	1	12
Don't shoot at anything	1	12
unless it shoots at you first.	1	12
What? What? What?	1	12
Shut up! Just stay down!	1	12
Shit!	1	12
Don't they know this is a hospital?	1	12
We're nuts if they know that.	1	12
[gunfire stops]	1	12
Is it over?	1	12
I don't know.	1	12
You think they'll be back? I don't know.	1	12
We didn't shoot back. That helps.	1	12
You pissed yourself.	1	12
What?	1	12
Did I?	1	12
Crap.	1	12
[coughing]	1	12
[Doctor] How are we doing, Lieutenant Draper?	1	12
[Soldier] On behalf of the President of the United States	1	12
and the citizens of the United States of America...	1	12
I present you with this Purple Heart medal.	1	12
[Doctor] The concussion was minor.	1	12
You'll feel like yourself in a week.	1	12
The colonel here has some good news for you.	1	12
[Colonel] We're releasing you to the Reserves	1	12
for your last 80 days.	1	12
You're going home.	1	12
That's good news. You're going to be okay.	1	12
Lieutenant Draper,	1	12
Private Whitman.	1	12
You were the last person	1	12
who knew him in his chain of command.	1	12
We'd like you to take him home.	1	12
I think it would mean something.	1	12
[Doctor] Lieutenant Nelson, how you doing?	1	12
On behalf of the President of the United States	1	12
and the citizens of the United States of America...	1	12
[driver] Bunbury.	1	12
This is us, Lieutenant.	1	12
Lieutenant Draper?	1	12
Just go.	1	12
I can't.	1	12
Okay.	1	12
There he is! I see him!	1	12
Who?	1	12
Dick. He's on the train.	1	12
I see him.	1	12
No, he's right here.	1	12
But I saw him.	1	12
I saw him in the window over there.	1	12
Stop it. No more of that.	1	12
[Woman] It must be hard for you.	1	12
Did you know him?	1	12
A little.	1	12
You got your whole life ahead of you.	1	12
Forget that boy in the box.	1	12
Look at you.	1	12
Let me buy a soldier a drink.	1	12
Dick!	1	12
Dick!	1	12
[sighs]	1	12
[Richard Nixon on TV] With that,	1	12
I want to say again	1	12
my deep thanks to all of you who are here	1	12
and those who have listened	1	12
on television and radio,	1	12
and again my congratulations to Senator Kennedy	1	12
for his fine race in this campaign,	1	12
and to all of you...	1	12
[crowd cheers]	1	12
I am sure...	1	12
I am sure his supporters	1	12
are just as enthusiastic as you are for me,	1	12
and I thank you for that.	1	12

I like this for the powder room,	1	13
but definitely not the bedroom.	1	13
It's a little busy.	1	13
I'm not sure.	1	13
It's not the curtains I'm worried about,	1	13
but the cabinets.	1	13
Nixon didn't stand a chance.	1	13
The Browns trounced the Redskins,	1	13
31-10.	1	13
The results of that last home game	1	13
 has correctly predicted the last six elections.	1	13
I wish someone would have told me that.	1	13
Of course, it's really a 50/50 chance	1	13
of being right.	1	13
Um...	1	13
I want to treat you like a son	1	13
because... I feel that way towards you.	1	13
Okay.	1	13
Trudy told us that you were up for a promotion	1	13
and you didn't get it or something.	1	13
I wish she hadn't.	1	13
Now, she loves you.	1	13
And honestly,	1	13
I think you need to take a little focus off your work.	1	13
 This from one of the top salesmen at Vicks Chemical.	1	13
When you started talking	1	13
about that Clearasil company you bought...	1	13
Now, that was kind of worth bragging about.	1	13
Did you know that there's a surge in adolescents right now?	1	13
I'll tell you, Sterling Cooper and yours truly	1	13
would love to help you deliver that message.	1	13
See? Now that's what I'm talking about.	1	13
The only family and business you should be mixing	1	13
is the production of a child.	1	13
And what did Trudy say about that?	1	13
[Trudy] About what?	1	13
Tom, loose lips sink ships.	1	13
I was just saying that work isn't everything, you know.	1	13
It's like that song says:	1	13
um, tend your own garden.	1	13
What song is that, Daddy?	1	13
Uh, I don't know.	1	13
People say it. It's true.	1	13
It is true.	1	13
Yeah. Tend to your own garden.	1	13
That means...	1	13
you know,	1	13
start growing things.	1	13
Daddy! [Tom laughs]	1	13
You're embarrassing us.	1	13
It'll be the best Christmas present	1	13
this one ever had.	1	13
And hell, Thanksgiving's Thursday.	1	13
[Trudy laughs]	1	13
Oh, and I guess I should go to Keppler Farm	1	13
to get some acorn squash.	1	13
What am I doing? They have squash there.	1	13
Very good squash, actually.	1	13
I wish you would come.	1	13
Birdie, I'm a partner.	1	13
80% of my business rolls out next week.	1	13
It just seems silly for me	1	13
to go down there for a 12-hour Thanksgiving.	1	13
What about...	1	13
Sally and Bobby's childhood memories?	1	13
There was no reason you couldn't have it up here.	1	13
You know my brother's children are animals.	1	13
They can't make the trip up here,	1	13
and I don't want my dad to be alone.	1	13
I'll take a cab to the train,	1	13
and William will pick us up,	1	13
probably in some new car.	1	13
You know what? I...	1	13
I don't think you want to go.	1	13
I'm sorry. Was I unclear about that?	1	13
I don't understand	1	13
why you can't make my family your family.	1	13
Ken is perfectly happy to have me here.	1	13
What do you think it's like? He's a bachelor. It's dirty.	1	13
I'm not complaining.	1	13
I don't think it's a good idea	1	13
to spend money on a hotel right now.	1	13
If you're so worried about my well-being,	1	13
let me come home.	1	13
That's not what I meant.	1	13
I mean, I know how it sounded.	1	13
Jennifer.	1	13
Yes.	1	13

I miss you...	1	13
so much.	1	13
[door closes]	1	13
Those the legendary secret files of Bert Cooper?	1	13
No.	1	13
I got a call from Abraham Menken.	1	13
I'm sure you know that his daughter will be unavailable	1	13
for the next three months,	1	13
taking some sort of ocean voyage to Paris	1	13
and whatnot.	1	13
I hadn't heard that.	1	13
But otherwise?	1	13
There is no otherwise.	1	13
Why is this man calling me?	1	13
I don't know. Is he unhappy?	1	13
As a partner, I do not expect your personal preferences	1	13
to interfere with our business.	1	13
Who says I have?	1	13
It was the tone of his voice.	1	13
He's her father.	1	13
That's it, cowboy.	1	13
[doorbell rings]	1	13
Francine.	1	13
I'm coming in. I'm freezing.	1	13
You're in your slippers.	1	13
I've been outside waiting for you to come home,	1	13
just sitting in the car hoping no one would see me.	1	13
What's going on?	1	13
Are your kids home?	1	13
No. What happened?	1	13
I'm so stupid.	1	13
I'm so damn stupid.	1	13
You're not, Francine.	1	13
Whatever happened, you're not stupid.	1	13
My mind hasn't been so sharp since I had the baby.	1	13
And Carlton gave me a stack of mail,	1	13
and honestly I think I just threw it away.	1	13
And four days later, the phone was cut off,	1	13
so I had to go to the phone company	1	13
and pay it, or, you know, he'd have a fit.	1	13
And I had to do all this without him knowing.	1	13
How perfect.	1	13
I don't understand.	1	13
They gave me the bill.	1	13
It was close to $18.	1	13
There were all these calls:	1	13
long distance, MH.	1	13
MH? Manhattan?	1	13
So I called one.	1	13
A woman answered.	1	13
I had just...	1	13
"I said, ""I'm calling from Carlton Hanson's office."""	1	13
"She said, ""Really?"""	1	13
"And I said, ""He wants to have dinner tonight at the usual place."""	1	13
What made you say that?	1	13
What woman would he be calling in Manhattan	1	13
who answers her own phone?	1	13
Married women.	1	13
Lots of women answer their own phones.	1	13
So he's calling some married woman from my house	1	13
while I'm upstairs sleeping?	1	13
Maybe it's a caterer.	1	13
Maybe he's throwing you a surprise party.	1	13
Do you know he spends two nights a week at the Waldorf?	1	13
I'm so stupid.	1	13
Assuming the worst...	1	13
The worst is that I'll poison him.	1	13
He's so stupid, he'd drink anything.	1	13
I'm going to have a house full of people.	1	13
I'll poison them all:	1	13
his parents, my parents...	1	13
my kids.	1	13
Stop it.	1	13
Stop that, Francine.	1	13
You're emotional. It doesn't mean...	1	13
Damn it, Betty. I know everything.	1	13
What am I going to do?	1	13
I've been sitting outside in the car.	1	13
What do I do? I thought you'd know what to do.	1	13
Me? I... Why?	1	13
I don't know.	1	13
I'm s...	1	13

and you can hear it in her voice.	1	13
I can't believe I'm in this argument.	1	13
Sorry about that, Rita.	1	13
Hi, Annie. We'll do this tomorrow.	1	13
Check with Peggy here for your session.	1	13
If I get a hard time about this,	1	13
I'm telling people it was your idea.	1	13
It was my idea.	1	13
Just a minute. I'll be right back.	1	13
Do you have to?	1	13
Peter.	1	13
That's risky business.	1	13
It is, isn't it?	1	13
What, honey?	1	13
You can say anything to me.	1	13
I can't provide for a child	1	13
on what I make.	1	13
Don't worry about that.	1	13
How could I not?	1	13
You can't.	1	13
Really?	1	13
You can't worry about that.	1	13
So stay here.	1	13
Oh... Peter.	1	13
Hi, Birdie.	1	13
It's 9:30. Why didn't you just stay in the city?	1	13
Oh, I have work to do here as well.	1	13
Do you know where the slide projector is?	1	13
So you're not going to see us for four days,	1	13
and you're not going to see us now.	1	13
Bets, right when I walk in the door?	1	13
I'm sorry.	1	13
I'm sorry. I just... I had a terrible day.	1	13
Sit with me.	1	13
What happened?	1	13
Francine told me	1	13
Carlton has been having an affair.	1	13
Really?	1	13
She was in pieces, Don.	1	13
I didn't know what to say to her.	1	13
Well, what could you say?	1	13
I'm surprised she told you.	1	13
Why?	1	13
She's like a sister to me.	1	13
Of course she is.	1	13
I never liked Carlton.	1	13
He was never my favorite.	1	13
She should poison him.	1	13
Now you think she should kill him?	1	13
How could someone do that	1	13
to the person that they love?	1	13
That they have children with?	1	13
Doesn't this all mean anything?	1	13
Who knows why people do what they do?	1	13
Come on.	1	13
Bring the wine.	1	13
It's actually a hell of a gadget.	1	13
It's continuous, doesn't jam.	1	13
They call it the Doughnut or the Wheel.	1	13
They're expecting something along those lines.	1	13
Kodak reinvented the wheel.	1	13
They're going to hear that ten times.	1	13
They actually want you to use	1	13
the words Research and Development	1	13
in the ads.	1	13
But if you could find a way	1	13
to put the Wheel and the Future	1	13
into something with some legs,	1	13
you could make me look good	1	13
my first month here.	1	13
"""I never thought it would happen to me,"	1	13
"""but I regained my youth and my happiness."	1	13
"""Just ask my husband."	1	13
"""I swear, he looks at me like the night we met."	1	13
"""It's true that while simply relaxing"	1	13
"I can get all the benefits of""..."	1	13
I'm sorry. We have to get a level here.	1	13
No, we don't.	1	13
She doesn't sound very confident.	1	13
She just started.	1	13
Give her a direction.	1	13
Okay, Annie.	1	13
Confidence.	1	13
Okay.	1	13
"""I never thought it would happen to me,"	1	13
"""but I regained my youth and my happiness."	1	13
"""Just ask my husband."	1	13
"I swear, he looks at me like the night we met."""	1	13
Annie.	1	13
Yes?	1	13
Are you married?	1	13
No.	1	13
I could have told you that.	1	13
Well, try and imagine you're you, Annie,	1	13
and now you have everything.	1	13
You're beautiful, you're slim,	1	13
you're the beloved prize of a handsome man,	1	13
and you have everything when you use the Relax-a-Cizor.	1	13
Okay.	1	13
It's too bad your voice is so annoying.	1	13
"""I never thought it would happen to me,"	1	13
"""but I regained my youth and my happiness."	1	13
"Just ask my husband."""	1	13
Hold on, Annie.	1	13
We have a problem with the tape recorder.	1	13
Say something to her.	1	13
Make her feel beautiful.	1	13
You know, the confidence that comes with beauty.	1	13
Pegs, a woman who looks like that	1	13
will never sound confident	1	13
because she never is confident.	1	13
Baloney.	1	13
Honey, it's God's gift to bachelors.	1	13
The juiciest gazelle is the easiest to catch.	1	13
Can I... I have a bit of a cold in my throat.	1	13
Can I get some pineapple juice?	1	13
There's a glass of water in the corner.	1	13
It's great for your throat.	1	13
I didn't believe that, either.	1	13
Let's try it again, Annie.	1	13
Happy, confident, beautiful.	1	13
"""I never thought it would happen to me,"	1	13
"""but I regained my youth and my happiness."	1	13
"""Just ask my husband."	1	13
"I swear, he looks at me like the night we""..."	1	13
Annie.	1	13
You're married.	1	13
Maybe you put on a few pounds,	1	13
but then you got the Relax-a-Cizor,	1	13
and you're back to being you,	1	13
right now.	1	13
I don't know that I understand.	1	13
Annie, what don't you understand?	1	13
I am being me.	1	13
Just give me a second.	1	13
I'll get it the way you want it.	1	13
"""I never thought it would happen to me, but""..."	1	13
I never thought this would happen to me, but...	1	13
"""I never thought it would happen to me, but""..."	1	13
Look, Pegs, you dangled her in front of me,	1	13
and now you're ruining it.	1	13
Don't do that to me.	1	13
Kenny, be professional, would you?	1	13
This is not working out.	1	13
We're going to have to let you go.	1	13
You could have gone in there and said that.	1	13
In this order,	1	13
I want you to go after her	1	13
and console her.	1	13
And after you make plans	1	13
or whatever you need to do,	1	13
call Rita.	1	13
The older lady you liked?	1	13
She's probably home with the Relax-a-Cizor right now.	1	13
Can you get me the, uh...	1	13
the Brighton Hotel, Times Square?	1	13
[phone rings]	1	13
Brighton.	1	13
Yes. Uh, sorry to bother you so late.	1	13
I'm looking for someone.	1	13
A tenant of yours	1	13
some... some months back.	1	13
A guest.	1	13
Yes. Uh,	1	13
I'd love to know if he left a forwarding address.	1	13
His name is...	1	13
Adam Whitman.	1	13
Right. Can I ask what you want?	1	13
Just a forwarding address.	1	13
I'm trying to contact him.	1	13
He has red hair...	1	13
over 6 feet.	1	13
Now listen. I know who you're talking about.	1	13
Jesus, I...	1	13
Hate to be the one to tell you this,	1	13
but he hung himself.	1	13
What?	1	13
Yeah.	1	13
Adam Whitman.	1	13
Yeah. I'm sorry.	1	13
Left the building a bunch of money.	1	13
The city took it.	1	13
It was in the Post.	1	13
Oh.	1	13
Well,	1	13
I hate to be the one to give that news.	1	13
Okay.	1	13
[ring]	1	13
[ring]	1	13
[Man] Hello.	1	13
Yes. Hello.	1	13
Who is this?	1	13
Who is this?	1	13
This is Dr. Arnold Wayne.	1	13
Mrs. Albertson, I have warned you,	1	13
this is inappropriate.	1	13
[dial tone]	1	13
Are we on fire?	1	13
Don.	1	13
No. I, uh...	1	13
dropped a cigarette in my waste basket.	1	13
Harry, come here. I want to talk to you.	1	13
Okay.	1	13
Harry, I want to talk to you.	1	13
I can explain.	1	13
What is the benefit of that thing?	1	13
Uh...	1	13
it sells projectors to people who already have them.	1	13
Yeah, the wheel.	1	13
Stacks, you store your slides in it,	1	13
and it's ready to go.	1	13
I took pictures for the paper at Wisconsin.	1	13
The machinery is definitely part of the fun.	1	13
It's mechanical.	1	13
What did you take pictures of?	1	13
Girls, mostly.	1	13
You could go up and ask them their names afterwards	1	13
like you were going to put it in the paper.	1	13
And some other stuff.	1	13
Artsy-craftsy stuff.	1	13
They gave me hell about it.	1	13
Artsy, like what?	1	13
Like the reflection of a tree in a pond?	1	13
Uh, worse.	1	13
I did a whole series	1	13
that was just handprints on glass.	1	13
You know, the way it fogs up around your heat.	1	13
Take it off, take a picture.	1	13
Black and white, I suppose.	1	13
Of course.	1	13
I was always fascinated	1	13
by the cave paintings of Lascaux.	1	13
They're, like, 17,000 years old.	1	13
The bison get all the attention,	1	13
but there are also all of these handprints,	1	13
tiny by today's standards,	1	13
with paint blown all around them.	1	13
Signature of the artist.	1	13
But I thought it was like someone...	1	13
reaching through the stone and right to us.	1	13
"""I was here."""	1	13
Are you okay?	1	13
That'll be all.	1	13
[door closes]	1	13
Glen?	1	13
I'm not supposed to talk to you.	1	13
Who says... Who said that?	1	13
My mother and my father.	1	13
I don't care.	1	13
My mother's going to come out.	1	13
I don't care.	1	13
Glen...	1	13
I can't talk to anyone.	1	13
It's so horrible.	1	13
I'm so sad.	1	13
Don't cry.	1	13
Please...	1	13
Please tell me I'll be okay.	1	13
I don't know.	1	13
I wish I was older.	1	13
Oh, adults don't know anything, Glen.	1	13
I don't really know how long 20 minutes is.	1	13
Of course, dear.	1	13
Don, I hope I'm not bothering you.	1	13
I just wanted to let you know	1	13
I took Duck's talk very seriously.	1	13
And without having to crack my Deerfield yearbook,	1	13
I've brought in an account.	1	13
Good for you.	1	13
It's a piece of Vicks Chemical Company.	1	13
Clearasil.	1	13
Better potential	1	13
than any traditional pharmaceutical, I believe.	1	13
That's a real account, Campbell.	1	13
How'd that happen?	1	13
I'm not embarrassed to say	1	13
my father-in-law's a former salesman,	1	13
now executive there.	1	13
That's generous.	1	13
He's interested in my future.	1	13
Congratulations.	1	13
I'm sure, with a little bit of lawyering,	1	13
you're entitled to that bonus.	1	13
I got the bonus.	1	13
And Cooper gave me some book by Ayn Rand.	1	13
He seemed assured, as I hope you are,	1	13
that I have a significant investment in this company.	1	13
Well, you do now, don't you?	1	13
It matters to me that you're impressed.	1	13
I am.	1	13
Self-worth and status.	1	13
You said it.	1	13
[door closes]	1	13
Thanksgiving.	1	13
It's very n-nerve-wracking,	1	13
having to deal with getting the family together.	1	13
My m... My mother didn't...	1	13
cook last year because she was so sick.	1	13
And now I'm going to have to deal with Gloria.	1	13
But it is Thanksgiving, and...	1	13
I'm grateful for things.	1	13
Like this.	1	13
This has helped.	1	13
Don doesn't think so, but it has.	1	13
Being able to talk.	1	13
Just... Just me and you and your little pad.	1	13
It has helped.	1	13
Still, I...	1	13
I can't help but think	1	13
that I would be happy	1	13
if my husband was faithful to me.	1	13
My brother's children are very badly behaved, and...	1	13
he spanks them.	1	13
Don has never laid a hand on the kids.	1	13
He's kind inside.	1	13
But outside, it...	1	13
It's all there in my face every day.	1	13
The hotel rooms.	1	13
Sometimes perfume...	1	13
or worse.	1	13
He doesn't know what family is.	1	13
He doesn't even have one.	1	13
It makes me sorry for him...	1	13
when in fact I...	1	13
I should be angry...	1	13
very angry, you know?	1	13
But I put up with it, like some ostrich.	1	13
It's interesting, isn't it?	1	13
The way he m...	1	13
He makes love...	1	13
sometimes it's what I want.	1	13
But sometimes it's obviously what someone else wants.	1	13
I suppose it means I'm not enough.	1	13
But maybe it...	1	13
It's just him.	1	13
Don Draper and Salvatore Romano,	1	13
this is Joe Harriman and Lynn Taylor.	1	13
No Eastmans today, unfortunately.	1	13
They're all back in the lab.	1	13
It's a wonderful facility,	1	13
but they don't take vacations.	1	13
What do they show, slides of them working?	1	13
So have you figured out a way to work the wheel into it?	1	13
We know it's hard	1	13
because wheels aren't really seen	1	13
as exciting technology,	1	13
even though they are the original.	1	13
Well, technology is a glittering lure,	1	13
but there's the rare occasion	1	13
when the public can be engaged	1	13
on the level beyond flash,	1	13
if they have a sentimental bond with the product.	1	13
My first job,	1	13
I was in house at a fur company	1	13
with this old pro copyrighter,	1	13
a Greek named Teddy.	1	13
And Teddy told me the most important idea in advertising	1	13
"is ""new."""	1	13
Creates an itch.	1	13
You simply put your product in there	1	13
as a kind of... calamine lotion.	1	13
He also talked about a deeper bond with the product.	1	13
Nostalgia.	1	13
It's delicate...	1	13
but potent.	1	13
Sweetheart.	1	13
Teddy told me that in Greek,	1	13
nostalgia literally means the pain from an old wound.	1	13
It's a twinge in your heart	1	13
far more powerful than memory alone.	1	13
This device...	1	13
isn't a space ship.	1	13
It's a time machine.	1	13
It goes backwards, forwards.	1	13
It takes us to a place where we ache to go again.	1	13
It's not called the Wheel.	1	13
It's called the Carousel.	1	13
It lets us travel the way a child travels.	1	13
Around and around and back home again...	1	13
to a place where we know we are loved.	1	13
Good luck at your next meeting.	1	13
Don, I have to warn you, I'm not alone.	1	13
It was beautiful.	1	13
Congratulations, mein Kommandant.	1	13
They called from the lobby.	1	13
They cancelled their other meetings,	1	13
including DDB.	1	13
Not just a victory for us.	1	13
It's a victory for civilization.	1	13
There's also more celebrating.	1	13
Mr. Campbell, here,	1	13
your father-in-law called.	1	13
He'll be in before Christmas.	1	13
I've got to get married.	1	13
No, thank you. I'm good.	1	13
Here's how.	1	13
Cheers. Cheers.	1	13
You know what, Pete?	1	13
I've got a way for you	1	13
to turn this account into a home run.	1	13
He's on a roll.	1	13
Clearasil.	1	13
You know who buys that?	1	13
Young girls.	1	13
What a difference it makes in their lives	1	13
to be blemish-free.	1	13
I believe it does.	1	13
We have the perfect writer for that.	1	13
Peggy Olsen.	1	13
That's funny.	1	13
Freddy Rumsen and I were both very impressed	1	13
with her insight.	1	13
Freddy Rumsen.	1	13
[Ken] If I can weigh in... No.	1	13
Come on. That Belle Jolie thing.	1	13
Plus you should have seen her in that booth yesterday.	1	13
She was like Kinsey but with balls.	1	13
[laughter]	1	13
Stop joking already, will you, Don?	1	13
Excuse me?	1	13
This is my father-in-law.	1	13
He's expecting the very best.	1	13
I'm expecting the very best,	1	13
not some little girl who'll walk away.	1	13
You'll have to give back that copy of Ayn Rand.	1	13
Do you know how hard I worked to get this account?	1	13
Who the hell is she?	1	13
Peggy is not even a copywriter.	1	13
She's a... a secretary.	1	13
Peggy!	1	13
Yes, Mr. Draper?	1	13
Miss Olsen, you are now a junior copywriter.	1	13
Your first account	1	13
will be delivering Clearasil to the spotted masses.	1	13
What?	1	13
Don't act surprised.	1	13
Is this really happening?	1	13
Yes, it is.	1	13
My goodness.	1	13
I will do my sincere best.	1	13
Good to hear.	1	13
Mr. Campbell, here,	1	13
will brief you after the holiday.	1	13
Of course.	1	13
That'll be all.	1	13
Thank you, Mr. Draper.	1	13
I said congratulations, didn't I?	1	13
Although sometimes when people get what they want,	1	13
they realize how limited their goals were.	1	13
So I guess I'll put you in with Victor Manning.	1	13
David Steuben got fired.	1	13
Fired?	1	13
People hated his work.	1	13
Oh.	1	13
Will I get business cards?	1	13
Please make all your requests through Bridget.	1	13
Of course.	1	13
Peggy, I know you a little.	1	13
Remember, just because you now have a door,	1	13
don't forget that once you didn't.	1	13
Think of the other girls, or they won't think of you.	1	13
Vic Manning, I'd like you to meet Peggy Olsen.	1	13
She'll be taking Mr. Steuben's desk.	1	13
Nice to meet you.	1	13
I don't feel so swell.	1	13
I think I should go home.	1	13
I have to stop eating off the cart.	1	13
If you're trying to find a way to go out and celebrate,	1	13
you should ask your secretary to cover for you.	1	13
Very funny.	1	13
Happy Thanksgiving.	1	13
You, too, Joan.	1	13
David and I had a deal.	1	13
No meetings in here, okay?	1	13
And no music.	1	13
What can we do for you today?	1	13
My stomach hurts really bad.	1	13
I think I had a bad sandwich.	1	13
Let's take a look.	1	13
Oh, my God.	1	13
Honey, you didn't mention that you were expecting.	1	13
What?	1	13
You're going to be a mother.	1	13
That's impossible.	1	13
You want us to call your husband	1	13
or your boyfriend?	1	13
I don't understand.	1	13
Stop talking.	1	13
Now listen, we're going to get you up to Maternity.	1	13
No. No, that's not possible.	1	13
Do you feel that?	1	13
Ohh! My God!	1	13
We need a wheelchair.	1	13
It hurts!	1	13
It's going to be okay, all right?	1	13
We just want you to calm down.	1	13
You don't understand.	1	13
We need a wheelchair!	1	13
Ahh!	1	13
Ahh!	1	13
Call Dr. Wilson in Psychiatry.	1	13
Oh.	1	13
Hello, darling.	1	13
Oh, were they having a party at the office?	1	13
Yes.	1	13
I think I should...	1	13
lie down.	1	13
That's a good idea.	1	13
Sure. Rest up.	1	13
But make sure you're awake later.	1	13
Daddy!	1	13
Would you like to try to feed him?	1	13
Don't you want to hold him, sweetheart?	1	13
[baby coos]	1	13
[general chatter]	1	13
Hello?	1	13
Don?	1	13
What are you doing here?	1	13
Daddy! Are you coming with us?	1	13
No, he isn't. Daddy has to work.	1	13
But you can drive us to the station.	1	13
I haven't called the taxi yet.	1	13
I'm coming with you.	1	13
Really?	1	13
You are?	1	13
I'll pack the car.	1	13
We'll be there before midnight.	1	13
Daddy's coming with you.	1	13
Daddy! Daddy!	1	13

Sit up straight.	2	1
Heels down. Lighten your hands.	2	1
Good girl.	2	1
There we go.	2	1
Now, if you can step over here.	2	1
You're a big one.	2	1
Thank you, Lilly.	2	1
Have a seat.	2	1
So, Mr. Draper,	2	1
you haven't had a physical in quite some time.	2	1
I eat a lot of apples.	2	1
What is it with you boys?	2	1
Why does it take an insurance physical to get you in here?	2	1
What's the number?	2	1
Because that will mean something to you?	2	1
It's 160 over 100,	2	1
which is high for boys our age.	2	1
Tell me about your parents.	2	1
Living or deceased?	2	1
Dead. Both.	2	1
Ages?	2	1
My dad was 41, 42.	2	1
He died in an accident,	2	1
and my mother died in childbirth.	2	1
She was 22, I think.	2	1
How many drinks do you have a day?	2	1
Wine, cocktails, beer.	2	1
Everything depends on the day.	2	1
Days of plenty being?	2	1
Three.	2	1
You're a high-powered businessman with a high-tension job.	2	1
I'm trying to help you here.	2	1
Five.	2	1
And two packs a day, but you're cutting down.	2	1
Yes.	2	1
All right.	2	1
Any changes in the last year?	2	1
What do you mean?	2	1
In your health.	2	1
How do you feel when you wake up in the morning?	2	1
How do you feel?	2	1
You live too hard,	2	1
and not just at the office.	2	1
It'll hit you all at once.	2	1
Nope. No, I've been... I've been good.	2	1
All right, I'm going to write you some reserpine to bring that down	2	1
and some phenobarbital to help you relax.	2	1
You're 36 years old.	2	1
You need to take this seriously.	2	1
Buy a boat.	2	1
Breathe in.	2	1
So I wait for Becky to go play,	2	1
and I look in her pencil case.	2	1
There's almost 20 dimes.	2	1
She stopped eating lunch.	2	1
I hate the dishonesty.	2	1
You should be glad she watches what she eats.	2	1
That's the truth. She is slimming down.	2	1
Good morning, ladies.	2	1
You want to get off right here?	2	1
You can go right to your car.	2	1
No.	2	1
He's a prisoner of war.	2	1
Because he can't ride.	2	1
A man that age doesn't suddenly take this up.	2	1
He's 25.	2	1
Did he tell you that?	2	1
I think so.	2	1
He talks to me. He's engaged.	2	1
There's no point in being aloof.	2	1
I wouldn't know what to talk about.	2	1
Aren't you funny? Are you scandalized?	2	1
No.	2	1
Well, if you must know, we talk about you	2	1
and how Gertie has a crush on you.	2	1
She's a sadist.	2	1
I'll see you Saturday.	2	1
Don't you hate getting manure in that?	2	1
Little children. What's the difference?	2	1
Look, miss, just tell me where you want it.	2	1
I could take out the lockers and use that wall.	2	1
The break room?	2	1
Don't take away the break room.	2	1
I'm not taking away anything.	2	1
Believe me, this machine is a gift to you girls.	2	1
Happy Valentine's, girls.	2	1
How are you going to wear that around your neck?	2	1
It's much bigger than they said it was.	2	1
I think it needs an office.	2	1
Come on.	2	1
We're already doubling up. Don't do that.	2	1
My roommate works at Ernst and Ernst.	2	1
She did her birthday party invitations on this.	2	1
On colored paper.	2	1
I told you, miss, I'll try as many places as you want.	2	1
Maybe we should leave it here for the time being.	2	1
I don't care. I'm doing this.	2	1
If you think that if you start eating, we're all going to join you, you're wrong.	2	1
Look, Don's not one to stand on ceremony.	2	1
He's not going to care.	2	1
I made it. I knew Draper would be late.	2	1
I have some crackers in my desk.	2	1
So, burning the midnight oil.	2	1
S'all right.	2	1
Hope the words are good	2	1
'cause he ain't got any artwork.	2	1
You didn't have time to give it to Art?	2	1
You want to start living here?	2	1
I'm supposed to be at The Pen and Pencil by 12:30 every day.	2	1
I was promised.	2	1
Look, Freddie, the eating is the thing.	2	1
I'm sure you can have a drink.	2	1
It's an unspoken agreement.	2	1
I got you, Freddie.	2	1
Are these all the glasses, Peggy?	2	1
I don't know.	2	1
We have artwork.	2	1
Peggy, go see if we can expect Don today.	2	1
That's a good idea.	2	1
Draper's not going to yell at her.	2	1
You want to be alone with that?	2	1
I'm telling you, Draper knocked her up.	2	1
She goes away for a couple of months,	2	1
drops about 9 pounds, 8 ounces,	2	1
comes back with a job.	2	1
Don's been screwing me for the last three years.	2	1
I've got nothing.	2	1
What's everybody laughing at?	2	1
The great debate wages on about Peggy Olson's charmed career.	2	1
Fat farm.	2	1
I thought we had verification.	2	1
Do you have any idea when you'll be expecting Mr. Draper?	2	1
I was expecting him at the beginning of work today,	2	1
but then he called and said he'd be late.	2	1
He said he was going to the movies.	2	1
Pinocchio.	2	1
Thank you.	2	1
Are you insinuating something?	2	1
I wasn't doing anything, I don't think.	2	1
Well, I believe that.	2	1
I want you to imagine,	2	1
when you talk about Mr. Draper,	2	1
that he's standing right behind you.	2	1
And think about that whenever you speak of him.	2	1
Are you going to tell on me?	2	1
I didn't know. What did I do?	2	1
Do you know where Mr. Draper is?	2	1
No, I don't.	2	1
I think he was joking.	2	1
Lois, do you know where Mr. Draper is?	2	1
He's out.	2	1
Thank you, Lois.	2	1
How is it?	2	1
He wrote some of it here.	2	1
Some of it on 23rd Street, some place they tore down.	2	1
Makes you feel better about sitting in a bar at lunch.	2	1
Makes you feel like you're getting something done.	2	1
Yeah. It's all about getting things done.	2	1
Is it good?	2	1
I don't think you'd like it.	2	1
You wanted to see me?	2	1
I wanted to see that Valentine heart.	2	1
On my way out. Anything else?	2	1
I'm taking Mona to Lut?ce.	2	1
Let me hear what the living are up to.	2	1
You love her.	2	1
What happened to the Jewish doctor?	2	1
He's not Jewish.	2	1
Not anymore, but he was. Trust me.	2	1
Is he still a doctor?	2	1
You sound like a little girl.	2	1
What do you care?	2	1
I wish you every happiness.	2	1
I'm well aware this is vicarious. I already said that.	2	1
I already know what day he's going to ask me.	2	1
Does he know that?	2	1
Because I have a feeling there's a penalty for passing that date.	2	1
He knows.	2	1
Mr. Phillips here to see you.	2	1
Send him in.	2	1
Joan.	2	1
Did you girls get my candy?	2	1
Yes. It was appreciated and yet unappreciated.	2	1
Anything else?	2	1
No, thank you. That'll be all.	2	1
Got a second?	2	1
Nothing good ever started with that sentence.	2	1
It's not that. It's Martinson's Coffee.	2	1
I'm excited about the possibility of that happening,	2	1
and, as you recall,	2	1
Martinson's Coffee has a unique problem.	2	1
Good. We like that.	2	1
Well, that's just it.	2	1
No one under 25 drinks coffee anymore.	2	1
Just Pepsi.	2	1
They pour it on their Frosted Flakes.	2	1
For those who think young.	2	1
Which is why I was disappointed to see Don	2	1
put Fred Rumsen on this.	2	1
So Freddie doesn't drink coffee.	2	1
He doesn't wear a bra, either.	2	1
He managed to do a good job on Playtex.	2	1
It's frustrating not to have young people around here.	2	1
We're a young country.	2	1
The president has a baby.	2	1
Have you been out there?	2	1
It's rotten with kids.	2	1
And the cologne they wear.	2	1
Real kids. 25. Even less.	2	1
Maybe one of those teams.	2	1
The writer and the artist together.	2	1
Clients keep bringing it up.	2	1
Talk to Don about it. Just for Martinson's Coffee alone.	2	1
Can't you talk to Don about it?	2	1
I thought this was the way things were done here.	2	1
Didn't you tell me you were a bridge between Accounts and Don?	2	1
Doesn't sound like me.	2	1
Look, Don has talent.	2	1
You know how to deal with that, don't you?	2	1
Just assume that he knows	2	1
as much about business as you do,	2	1
but inside there's a child who likes getting his way.	2	1
He's not my first creative director.	2	1
This is about a sales reality and not personal territory.	2	1
It's what the clients are asking for, and we need to have it.	2	1
What's the best way to make it happen?	2	1
Mr. Draper.	2	1
Any calls?	2	1
Yes, and there was your 12:00	2	1
in the conference room.	2	1
Of course.	2	1
Well, girls can say whatever they want.	2	1
They want the chocolates.	2	1
Right, Peggy?	2	1
Of course they do.	2	1
I don't do anything. Keeps them off balance.	2	1
Hey, chief.	2	1
Sorry we're late.	2	1
I think the little ones need to eat.	2	1
What do we have? Dale, wake up.	2	1
I could just go.	2	1
Or Kinsey.	2	1
You want to go first?	2	1
Peggy.	2	1
I just wrote copy for Dale.	2	1
Well, this is kind of the gist, because I was...	2	1
Well, we were...	2	1
It just kept changing course.	2	1
"""Mohawk Airlines. There's a new chief in the sky. """	2	1
And I thought, following that,	2	1
"""Most routes to Boston."	2	1
"Circle the wagons, we've got it surrounded. """	2	1
"And there'd be wagons around a dot that says ""Boston. """	2	1
I can almost picture it. Sal.	2	1
This is the first time I'm hearing it, too.	2	1
So it's about an airline that's flown by Indians?	2	1
Maybe a plane with some arrows stuck in the cargo door?	2	1
That's funny.	2	1
That's what gets people's attention now, right?	2	1
There has to be advertising	2	1
for people who don't have a sense of humor.	2	1
I understand, Don.	2	1
What else you got?	2	1
Several more Indian puns.	2	1
Stop writing for other writers.	2	1
Luxury, service.	2	1
A lot of people are afraid of turbulence,	2	1
so it's dead calm.	2	1
Look how level those drinks are.	2	1
"""Wherever Mohawk takes us. """	2	1
"Or, ""You'll love getting there. """	2	1
What's outside that window?	2	1
- Fluffy clouds. - Research.	2	1
I get on a plane, I don't care where I'm going.	2	1
I just want to see the city disappearing behind me.	2	1
So we could take the clouds out of there and put in the city.	2	1
The Chrysler Building.	2	1
That Indian...	2	1
It's not about the majestic beauty of the Mohawk Nation.	2	1
It's about adventure.	2	1
Could be a pirate.	2	1
Could be a knight in shining armor.	2	1
Could be a conquistador getting off of a boat.	2	1
It's about a fantastical people	2	1
who are taking you someplace where you've never been.	2	1
We could dress the stew as Pocahontas.	2	1
With the cheekbones.	2	1
How's his wife going to feel about that?	2	1
Air travel's too expensive to waste on your wife.	2	1
You want to get on a plane to feel alive.	2	1
You want to get on a plane to see just the hint of a woman's thigh	2	1
because her skirt is just this much too short.	2	1
Friday?	2	1
Tomorrow.	2	1
What does that mean?	2	1
It means you want to go somewhere, go up her skirt.	2	1
That's the impression I got.	2	1
Carla, Bobby's turning blue out there.	2	1
Did somebody get a lot of valentines?	2	1
They made everybody give one to everybody else.	2	1
That defeats the purpose.	2	1
They had a party.	2	1
I see. Fruit punch?	2	1
I'm making this for Daddy.	2	1
It's beautiful.	2	1
I'll see that he gets it.	2	1
Mommy, can I do it?	2	1
Okay.	2	1
I want to go riding with you.	2	1
- You can't. - Well, why?	2	1
Well, for one thing, it's too dangerous.	2	1
No, it's not.	2	1
Do you remember what happened to the little girl in Gone With the Wind?	2	1
You are taking a bath tonight.	2	1
They say once you start drinking alone, you're an alcoholic.	2	1
I'm really trying to avoid that.	2	1
So I guess I'm helping both of us.	2	1
Cooper wants younger people.	2	1
For what purpose?	2	1
Martinson's Coffee.	2	1
Last time Freddie Rumsen had a cup of coffee,	2	1
it was one of five being poured down his throat by a cop.	2	1
Well, young campaigns don't necessarily come from young people.	2	1
The clients like it.	2	1
The clients like the thrill of young talent.	2	1
So what am I supposed to do?	2	1
Dangle a Pepsi out the window	2	1
and see if I can hook a stroller?	2	1
I have some candidates.	2	1
This smells like Accounts to me.	2	1
I had Paul Kinsey make up a list.	2	1
He had no idea he was signing his own death warrant.	2	1
You want younger people than that?	2	1
What do you want me to say?	2	1
Tell Duck clients don't understand.	2	1
Their success is related to standing out, not fitting in.	2	1
It's a fad.	2	1
Paint him a picture.	2	1
Something like one wants to be the needle in the haystack,	2	1
not a haystack.	2	1
Donald, isn't it possible that the recently weaned	2	1
have some unique perspective?	2	1
Joy, enthusiasm.	2	1
You're talking as if they're some fresh version of us.	2	1
They're not.	2	1
Young people don't know anything, especially that they're young.	2	1
Well, let me set this in a more appealing context for you.	2	1
Prove him wrong.	2	1
Happy Valentine's Day.	2	1
I love this place.	2	1
I know.	2	1
So what are we doing?	2	1
Don't worry, we will be out of here before the singer starts.	2	1
Juanita?	2	1
Betsy Hofstadt.	2	1
Look at you.	2	1
This is so nice.	2	1
Don, believe it or not, you two have met.	2	1
I don't think we have, Bets.	2	1
- Don Draper. - Hello.	2	1
A pleasure to meet you.	2	1
A pleasure.	2	1
Juanita was one of my roommates when I lived on the West Side.	2	1
We were models together.	2	1
In that horrible apartment.	2	1
Do you live in the city?	2	1
Well, I do.	2	1
Curtis is from Detroit.	2	1
Automobiles.	2	1
How are you?	2	1
I work as a decorator.	2	1
How exciting.	2	1
I have a little girl and boy.	2	1
Of course you do.	2	1
It looks like everything's going well.	2	1
My God, that stone.	2	1
That was a gift.	2	1
Give me your phone number.	2	1
Tell me how I can reach you.	2	1
Does anyone have a business card?	2	1
I do.	2	1
I would love a nice long lunch.	2	1
So nice to see you.	2	1
That is not who I thought she would end up with.	2	1
I don't think it's permanent.	2	1
Can you imagine still dating at our age?	2	1
She's a party girl, Bets.	2	1
Really?	2	1
Really.	2	1
And how do you know that?	2	1
Well?	2	1
How stupid do you think I am?	2	1
Juanita Carson.	2	1
Should I get another one here?	2	1
What are we doing?	2	1
How does room service sound?	2	1
I came prepared.	2	1
I suppose people get lonely.	2	1
And it's Valentine's Day.	2	1
Be mine for $100.	2	1
How much is it, do you think?	2	1
I told her I wanted to have hundreds of babies with you.	2	1
Wow.	2	1
Hello, lovely.	2	1
Hello.	2	1
Happy Valentine's.	2	1
That's so sweet.	2	1
I got your little note.	2	1
Well, Hildy did.	2	1
You have to be careful about just putting things in my bag.	2	1
Come on, open them. I want one.	2	1
Okay.	2	1
The round ones are coconut.	2	1
Should've got the kind where they put that chart in the box.	2	1
I spoke with Jennifer Crane.	2	1
She's expecting.	2	1
That's impossible.	2	1
Harry didn't tell me anything.	2	1
That's because he doesn't know.	2	1
She's going to surprise him tonight.	2	1
I just got so distracted.	2	1
Dinner's not for an hour.	2	1
Tweety.	2	1
There's no reason that's bad for us.	2	1
I saw this dumpy woman on Second Avenue	2	1
by the Hungarian market.	2	1
And she had her daughter pushing a stroller	2	1
with a little boy in it.	2	1
And she was round.	2	1
She was expecting another.	2	1
She was just buying fruit like it was any other day.	2	1
The daughter was pregnant.	2	1
No.	2	1
The mother.	2	1
It's this big club they're all in together.	2	1
Even her.	2	1
Well, rest assured.	2	1
She doesn't have what you have.	2	1
Jennifer Crane does.	2	1
Do you really believe that?	2	1
I guess not.	2	1
Hold on.	2	1
What's wrong?	2	1
Don, it's okay.	2	1
We've got all night.	2	1
I wish you would just tell me what to do.	2	1
We drank too much, you know.	2	1
I don't even know where I am.	2	1
You should eat something.	2	1
Hello. Yes.	2	1
This is Mr. Draper in room 804.	2	1
Yes. Can you send up some vichyssoise and a BLT on white toast?	2	1
No. Shrimp cocktail.	2	1
Two of them. Scratch that.	2	1
Two shrimp cocktails, please.	2	1
Wait a minute.	2	1
Hello.	2	1
Yeah. Do you have anything special?	2	1
Anything out of season?	2	1
This piano was designed	2	1
by Franklin Roosevelt...	2	1
Oh, leave that.	2	1
How about this?	2	1
I want a half avocado filled with crabmeat	2	1
and a rare petite filet.	2	1
Two place settings.	2	1
And if it's an American company	2	1
that you can help, I like to do that.	2	1
If it's not, just as long as it's the best.	2	1
I rather love this hall.	2	1
It has all the colors one thinks of	2	1
when one thinks of the White House...	2	1
red and white and blue and gold.	2	1
It's through this door that all the heads of state come.	2	1
And this is where the president meets them.	2	1
And here is where the Marine band plays.	2	1
"They have ""Ruffles and Flourishes,"""	2	1
"then ""Hail to the Chief. """	2	1
And then there's a receiving line,	2	1
and then everyone goes in to dinner here	2	1
in the State Dining Room.	2	1
Where's her husband?	2	1
...though the table now is not set up for that many.	2	1
Are there many state dinners?	2	1
Yes, there are.	2	1
There were almost two a month last year.	2	1
This room's interesting	2	1
because it has the most architecturally unity	2	1
of any room in the White House.	2	1
It's really all 1902	2	1
when Theodore Roosevelt took the great restoration	2	1
with McKim, Mead and White.	2	1
Which of these pieces have historical associations?	2	1
There are quite a few.	2	1
You have to see this.	2	1
...Dolly Madison's sofa.	2	1
That's Nelly Custis' sofa.	2	1
No, I don't.	2	1
She was Washington's granddaughter.	2	1
I feel so strongly	2	1
that the White House should have as fine a collection.	2	1
It's so important, the setting in which	2	1
the presidency is presented to the world.	2	1
What do you think it is?	2	1
I don't know,	2	1
but I'm going to find out.	2	1
And now a word from our sponsor.	2	1
Their armoire?	2	1
I've seen them in Connecticut, but they're copies.	2	1
You know, Jackie has a real one.	2	1
In the White House?	2	1
I think so.	2	1
She seemed nervous.	2	1
Even when she saw Jack at the end.	2	1
It was like they were playing house.	2	1
That's chocolate ice cream.	2	1
Or blood.	2	1
I couldn't throw it away.	2	1
It's French.	2	1
We'll call it chocolate ice cream, and I'll work on it.	2	1
Well, I'm sorry we missed it.	2	1
No time for television.	2	1
Stop rubbing it in.	2	1
Really. A room at the Savoy?	2	1
That takes thought.	2	1
Your night sounded very romantic.	2	1
I would describe it as delightfully disappointing.	2	1
There was a time when he overdid it,	2	1
but I'll take dull and know where I stand.	2	1
I agree.	2	1
What?	2	1
I ran into this old friend.	2	1
Juanita Carson.	2	1
We were models together.	2	1
Roommates.	2	1
She was in the lounge of the Savoy.	2	1
She didn't look cheap.	2	1
Except for this 2-carat stone.	2	1
But she wasn't with a date.	2	1
She was with a companion.	2	1
I don't understand.	2	1
Don agreed with me.	2	1
He was an old man.	2	1
She's a call girl.	2	1
Really?	2	1
Butterfield 8?	2	1
I wonder what that's like.	2	1
I don't know.	2	1
New York... Manhattan... is expensive.	2	1
We forget that.	2	1
I used to look at people in restaurants with envy.	2	1
Don gave me a fur coat.	2	1
If prostitution is Don showing up with a fur coat,	2	1
sign me up.	2	1
I don't think it's like that.	2	1
I just keep picturing Juanita at 22 years old.	2	1
We shared a room.	2	1
Talked in the dark...	2	1
I know we wanted the same things.	2	1
When I was 22, whenever I was really low on money,	2	1
I would call my father and let him know that I was going to Havana.	2	1
And he would, without fail, send $25 in cash in the mail.	2	1
He wanted you to have a good time.	2	1
No. He's a degenerate gambler.	2	1
And it would always come with a list of instructions	2	1
of how to bet it.	2	1
You're kidding me.	2	1
No. And he never won because I never went.	2	1
That's criminal.	2	1
What's wrong with the conference room?	2	1
Why don't we go to my office?	2	1
Plenty of room.	2	1
Braggart.	2	1
Nope. We're sitting here.	2	1
I'm trying to figure something out.	2	1
So, Pops, we should celebrate your soon-to-be-fat wife.	2	1
Aren't you happy?	2	1
Sure. I mean, it's going to be a lot of headaches.	2	1
Things are going to change. But come on.	2	1
He's really meeting with them.	2	1
Why are they doing this?	2	1
I guess you haven't been privy to some of Duck's scoutmaster talks	2	1
about how we need younger creative.	2	1
Who said that? Did he say that?	2	1
- A few times. - Wonderful.	2	1
Look, we're in the same boat.	2	1
I'm sure he'll turn his sights on us.	2	1
No one's been promoted in Accounts since he came in.	2	1
I can't believe Donald would listen to Duck.	2	1
Well, maybe Duck made him.	2	1
Nobody makes Draper do anything.	2	1
Let me tell you, Don Draper has a rope coiled under his desk,	2	1
and it's looped around Duck's neck.	2	1
And Duck's going to run around and run around,	2	1
and then one day...	2	1
There's a meeting? Nobody told me there was a meeting.	2	1
Can we change venues?	2	1
So, I have a lot of thoughts.	2	1
How old are you?	2	1
25.	2	1
24. But that r?sum?,	2	1
that's really just two years.	2	1
18 months, without a doubt.	2	1
Right.	2	1
You're experienced, I gather.	2	1
Are you married?	2	1
That's why we're on the purpose.	2	1
He's right.	2	1
We haven't settled down yet.	2	1
So, again, you both did everything together,	2	1
and yet you get paid more.	2	1
Well, I have a writing background.	2	1
Short fiction. And I'm a citizen.	2	1
But you contribute words.	2	1
Only when it's a distance.	2	1
I'm going to ask you a question	2	1
that was always asked of me when I was on job interviews.	2	1
That is divine, man.	2	1
Have you ever been fired?	2	1
I believe you that other people have them in the hallways.	2	1
I just don't know if that's right for us.	2	1
I mean, this is an environment for clients.	2	1
We don't want to appear to be bursting at the seams.	2	1
Lois, may I speak with you?	2	1
Theresa said there was an incident yesterday.	2	1
You were crying in the break room,	2	1
which I have specifically forbidden.	2	1
I'm sorry, but Peggy...	2	1
Miss Olson.	2	1
She yelled at me.	2	1
Why would she do that?	2	1
I'm good at my job.	2	1
The next time that you come to complain...	2	1
I wasn't complaining. You wanted to talk to me.	2	1
This is why I don't allow crying in the break room.	2	1
It erodes morale.	2	1
There's a place to do that, like your apartment.	2	1
It came over me.	2	1
And I would correct your attitude towards Miss Olson.	2	1
It's unbecoming.	2	1
Yes, Joan.	2	1
Do we like this in the hallway?	2	1
I think it looks good now,	2	1
but I think it will become messy.	2	1
I agree.	2	1
Looks good.	2	1
By the way, it has Julian Koenig's fingerprints all over it.	2	1
His Master's Voice.	2	1
Also not mine.	2	1
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Smith.	2	1
Smitty. Kurt.	2	1
We have the same last name. We don't want people to mix us up.	2	1
It must happen all the time. You two share an office?	2	1
Works best that way.	2	1
Look at this.	2	1
Gentlemen, your reputations precede you.	2	1
Duck Phillips, head of Account Services.	2	1
I get a distinct impression.	2	1
Pardon?	2	1
We'd rather people not know we were here.	2	1
If it gets out we're meeting...	2	1
- Of course not. - Yes, right.	2	1
Bye.	2	1
- I'll let him know she called. - Okay.	2	1
I like the direction you're taking.	2	1
Good.	2	1
Now that I've given you your babies and your Xerox machine,	2	1
should I throw in a couple of elephants?	2	1
I don't want there to be any excuse	2	1
when you can't bring in Martinson's Coffee.	2	1
Don't get worked up.	2	1
You know, there are other ways to think of things	2	1
than the way you think of them.	2	1
The testimonials.	2	1
I was thinking we could get younger girls.	2	1
Sixth graders.	2	1
It would mean different publications.	2	1
Do they need Clearasil that early?	2	1
- Doesn't matter. - Doesn't.	2	1
I guess we could try that.	2	1
Two more from DDB.	2	1
Even younger.	2	1
Just assume that everyone on the list you handed Roger is coming in.	2	1
You're an idiot.	2	1
I don't understand that. I'm only 22.	2	1
You don't count.	2	1
We've got to get him out of here.	2	1
Come on, Daddy.	2	1
How often do you get to celebrate getting some girl pregnant?	2	1
Campbell, you're buying.	2	1
We still have to show Mohawk to Mr. Draper.	2	1
Dale's not here.	2	1
Mr. Draper doesn't care.	2	1
Kids. What's the big deal?	2	1
Do you want to have kids?	2	1
Eventually.	2	1
Exactly.	2	1
Mr. Romano, Miss Olson.	2	1
Send them in.	2	1
Where are we?	2	1
You tell us.	2	1
"""Where are you going?"""	2	1
"Are you going to underline the ""you""?"	2	1
For half the people, it will be,	2	1
"""Where are you going?"""	2	1
"I also had ""Come away with us. """	2	1
Where the hell's Dale?	2	1
He's sick.	2	1
I don't know. Sure.	2	1
Fine.	2	1
It's exactly what we talked about.	2	1
It's obvious.	2	1
I'm uninvolved.	2	1
Move this up.	2	1
What about that?	2	1
I think it's sentimental.	2	1
Peggy.	2	1
No, she's right.	2	1
Just because it has sentiment doesn't make it sentimental.	2	1
We're talking about businessmen.	2	1
Right. Businessmen who like short skirts.	2	1
Sex sells.	2	1
Says who?	2	1
Just so you know,	2	1
the people who talk that way think that monkeys can do this.	2	1
And they take all this monkey crap and just stick it in a briefcase,	2	1
completely unaware that their success	2	1
depends on something more than their shoe shine.	2	1
You are the product.	2	1
You feeling something.	2	1
That's what sells.	2	1
Not them.	2	1
Not sex.	2	1
They can't do what we do.	2	1
And they hate us for it.	2	1
"""Welcome back, Daddy""?"	2	1
Is that a question?	2	1
"""What did you bring me, Daddy?"""	2	1
You can put that in your book.	2	1
What is going on?	2	1
He's going to take it to Leon in Actuarial?	2	1
His stomach's so fat, it's now resting on his desk.	2	1
Got to feed that big brain.	2	1
He's a deal breaker.	2	1
I'm a closer.	2	1
That Cecelia?	2	1
Sits outside Fred Talbot's office?	2	1
You made that happen?	2	1
Silver tongue.	2	1
I got her three stingers.	2	1
She's a little girl.	2	1
You have to give them an excuse.	2	1
That's what I always say.	2	1
"She had those panties that said ""Wednesday. """	2	1
They were soaked through.	2	1
I love that.	2	1
Once the engine was running,	2	1
she wouldn't stop.	2	1
She's so straight.	2	1
You'd think that.	2	1
Take your hat off.	2	1
Is there a problem?	2	1
Damn it.	2	1
Everything okay?	2	1
You know anything about cars?	2	1
No.	2	1
Can you tell them at the Esso to send a tow truck?	2	1
Okay.	2	1
Hey, Carla.	2	1
Hi.	2	1
Hey, Daddy.	2	1
How was your day, Mr. Draper?	2	1
I am tired.	2	1
Where's Mrs. Draper?	2	1
She just went to get Sally from ballet.	2	1
Want a ride to the station?	2	1
No. I'm all right.	2	1
It's a nice night out. I enjoy the fresh air.	2	1
Good night, Bobby.	2	1
Good night.	2	1
Good night.	2	1
I don't like it.	2	1
Here. Give it to me.	2	1
I just know when the smoke starts to come out,	2	1
I have to stop.	2	1
That's true.	2	1
I got a fan belt on the truck. I could put it in for $9.00.	2	1
Hold on.	2	1
I have $3.00 and change.	2	1
I could put it on account,	2	1
send you a bill.	2	1
I don't want my husband knowing about this.	2	1
It's a new car.	2	1
He doesn't like the way I drive.	2	1
That's got nothing to do with this.	2	1
Well, it would mean the world to me.	2	1
I don't know. You know, the...	2	1
the belt's 2.55.	2	1
So there's nothing you can do for a damsel in distress?	2	1
Are we bargaining here?	2	1
Well, yes, I guess we are.	2	1
I could say no, couldn't I?	2	1
That would be a terrible disappointment.	2	1
It would be, wouldn't it?	2	1
It's not that complicated.	2	1
That's a relief.	2	1
Well, that'll do it.	2	1
Have a good night now.	2	1
I will.	2	1
Polly!	2	1
I'm here, too.	2	1
Hi, Daddy.	2	1
Hi.	2	1
Bobby conked out.	2	1
Where were you?	2	1
Mommy was late.	2	1
I got stuck talking to Marilyn Keckner in the parking lot.	2	1
Well, I was here.	2	1
Did you eat something?	2	1
I did.	2	1
Come on, show me what you learned in ballet.	2	1
Now I am quietly waiting	2	1
for the catastrophe of my personality	2	1
to seem beautiful again,	2	1
and interesting and modern.	2	1
The country is gray	2	1
and brown and white and trees.	2	1
Snows and skies of laughter are always diminishing.	2	1
Less funny, not just darker.	2	1
Not just gray.	2	1
It may be the coldest day of the year.	2	1
What does he think of that?	2	1
I mean, what do I?	2	1
And if I do,	2	1
perhaps I am myself again.	2	1

Eugene, whom I just met,	2	2

Paul used to dress up like a girl.	2	2

Big, handsome, saves people's lives.	2	2
Why did you get the nice glass?	2	2
Because I have the Rhône Gallagher.	2	2
Fine. What is it?	2	2
There's a ship that went down in 1871,	2	2
and the casks of Rhône were on it.	2	2
It was a very good year.	2	2
And it sank,	2	2
and they washed up on shore two years ago,	2	2
and they sold 180 bottles,	2	2

Is the plane still crashed?	2	2
Shel was a client when I was at Y&R in London.	2	2
We had some times together.	2	2
It's complete chaos over there.	2	2
They have any idea what went wrong?	2	2
None.	2	2
Normal takeoff, perfect weather.	2	2
The thing just nose-dived, exploded.	2	2
That's not comforting.	2	2
Shel says they're going to need to make a fresh start.	2	2
"Did he say ""fresh start""?"	2	2
A few times.	2	2
That is an interesting phone call.	2	2
Yes.	2	2

Mr. Campbell, are you all right?	2	2

It's the strangest thing.	2	2
Apparently, my father was on that plane.	2	2
What?	2	2
My father, he was on the... the plane.	2	2
Oh.	2	2
God, I'm sorry to hear that.	2	2
I don't know what to do.	2	2
I just saw him	2	2
at the barber.	2	2
Paul Molé on Lex.	2	2
What does one do?	2	2

What am I supposed to do?	2	2
What people do.	2	2
Go home.	2	2
I don't even think I know how old he was.	2	2
Someone's going to ask that.	2	2
I don't know. I suppose.	2	2
You know what?	2	2
I don't think I'm going to tell anyone.	2	2
Am I going to cry?	2	2
You just had a shock.	2	2
I wouldn't...	2	2
worry about what you're feeling.	2	2
Go home and be with your family.	2	2
Why?	2	2
Because that's what people do.	2	2
Is that what you would do?	2	2
Yes.	2	2
Really?	2	2
Yes.	2	2
Everything's exactly the same.	2	2
You should go home.	2	2

Duck, tell Don here about your phone call.	2	2
Well, I put in a call	2	2
to check in with Shel Keneally over at American Airlines.	2	2
He used to run International. We're old pals.	2	2
He picked up the phone?	2	2
What's going on over there?	2	2
Shel says it's bedlam.	2	2
Anyway, he was quite clear about the fact	2	2
that they're going to want to make changes	2	2
if they want the dust to settle fast.	2	2
What does that mean?	2	2
It means they'll be looking for a new image	2	2
and thus a new agency.	2	2
What's it been, four, three hours	2	2
since the plane went down?	2	2
You'll have to forgive me	2	2
for not looking at a bunch of bodies in Jamaica Bay	2	2
and seeing the opportunity.	2	2
Adding a few hours or a day or a week	2	2
doesn't make this any more of an opportunity.	2	2
We already have an airline. We don't have American.	2	2
That's right. We have the one	2	2
whose planes didn't just fall out of the sky.	2	2
[chuckles] That's good.	2	2
[Duck] I'm sorry. Is there an issue?	2	2
$1 million. $7 million.	2	2
Am I missing something?	2	2
Did you sign American during this phone call?	2	2
No, but Shel made it very clear	2	2
that if we can get rid of our conflict,	2	2
he'd love to hear our ideas.	2	2
It's a serious foothold.	2	2
Oh, a foothold.	2	2
Well, I'd do anything for a foothold.	2	2
This is how it works.	2	2
We got a regional airline	2	2
so we'd have a shot at a big one.	2	2
I know how you had it in your head.	2	2
The President of American Airlines	2	2
sees a Mohawk ad, falls in love,	2	2
"and says ""Get me that guy."""	2	2
Well, I'm sorry it didn't play out that way.	2	2
Easy.	2	2
We have a good client who trusts us,	2	2
who likes our work,	2	2
who pays their bills on time.	2	2
They don't deserve to be thrown out the door	2	2
for a wink from American.	2	2
I can't believe this.	2	2
Anything else?	2	2
He'll be fine.	2	2
I'll need to cancel my reservations to Sarasota	2	2
and, of course, Andrew's return flight.	2	2
But I... Well, they can't possibly expect...	2	2
I'm sure that's taken care of.	2	2
Dunham's taking care of all that.	2	2
Bud's on the phone with him right now.	2	2
I'm sure he'll forget something.	2	2
There's no way that he can remember everything.	2	2
Bud's very good with things like this.	2	2
Is he aware there is no way	2	2
to have a funeral without the remains?	2	2
What's the difference?	2	2
You're right.	2	2
There's just so much to do.	2	2
What is that?	2	2
What?	2	2
That.	2	2
That.	2	2
What is that?	2	2
Take it.	2	2
I want you to have it.	2	2
He was such a fine man,	2	2
so well-mannered, civic.	2	2
My father admired him.	2	2
What a nice thing to say.	2	2
I like to offer a nice bouquet of thoughts.	2	2
[sighs]	2	2
Did you take care of everything?	2	2
They do this all the time.	2	2
What?	2	2
I took care of it.	2	2
Give me another one of those, a big one.	2	2
Dunham had some unpleasant news.	2	2
Dad was insolvent, broke.	2	2
Is there enough for a funeral?	2	2
As if the idea of a will never crossed your mind?	2	2
We weren't going to get that.	2	2
You weren't.	2	2
What about her money?	2	2
The Dykeman Trust isn't as solid as one would hope.	2	2

Really? For what?	2	2
[whispering] I asked Dunham if there was a woman.	2	2
He said no.	2	2
It's all oysters, travel, and club memberships.	2	2
Does she know?	2	2
You want to tell her? Go ahead.	2	2
Everything's been taken care of.	2	2
Boys.	2	2
Oh.	2	2
Father called you salt and pepper.	2	2
That's beautiful, Dot.	2	2
[door opens] Hi, Daddy.	2	2
[door closes]	2	2
I made you a ham sandwich.	2	2
What is this?	2	2
Carlton and Francine are coming over for cards.	2	2
Oh, Bets. Didn't we just do that?	2	2
We haven't done it since before Christmas.	2	2
And they keep inviting us, and we never go.	2	2
Can I play cards? I want to play.	2	2
I'm going to lie down for a minute.	2	2
I have the chenille bedspread on.	2	2
Pull it back or they'll see the marks on your face	2	2
and know you were sleeping.	2	2
You can say hello to everyone, then it's off to bed.	2	2
Muddled. That means smash it.	2	2
He'll be nicer on the second one.	2	2
You did a wonderful job on mine.	2	2
Thank you.	2	2
Go take Mommy and Francine's orders.	2	2
Bobby, that is your last one.	2	2
All right. Come on, go.	2	2
Watch TV.	2	2
They're growing like weeds.	2	2
That's true.	2	2
We have the Caruthers girl over to baby-sit already.	2	2
Can you believe that?	2	2
I don't think we know her.	2	2
You'd remember.	2	2
Goes to Immaculate Heart.	2	2
I've been out of high school a long time,	2	2
but honestly, the way these girls dress,	2	2
and those uniforms.	2	2
Carlton.	2	2
What?	2	2
I'm enjoying this story so far,	2	2
but I have a feeling it's not going to end well.	2	2
I think that Francine brings her in to torture me.	2	2
I mean, everything I do rubs her the wrong way.	2	2
I got rid of the apartment in the city.	2	2
I'm taking her to Nassau.	2	2
There was a pie cooling in the windowsill,	2	2
and I'm not even supposed to smell it?	2	2
It's Darkness at Noon.	2	2
What do you want to hear?	2	2
Now, come on. Don't be like that.	2	2
Two Tom Collins.	2	2
Okay, you don't smash the cherry on that.	2	2
Just plop it in at the end.	2	2
Try to keep it in the top of the glass.	2	2
Gin.	2	2
[Man on radio] Oil issues showed some signs of life today	2	2
when the Department of the Treasury	2	2
announced plans to ease import quotas on residual oil.	2	2
By the end of the day, Texaco added 1/4, Shell...	2	2
Oh, good, you didn't wait.	2	2
We couldn't. It's late.	2	2
Work.	2	2
Your hair looks nice.	2	2
It does, and she fought with Mr. Pierre every minute of it.	2	2
Monsieur.	2	2
He's got some funny ideas.	2	2
You want something to eat?	2	2
No, thank you. I already ate.	2	2
[radio shuts off]	2	2
Connie Griffin was in her yard,	2	2
hanging laundry in Bergen Beach.	2	2
She saw the whole thing.	2	2
Can you imagine?	2	2
WOR said there were sharks eating the victims.	2	2
That's worth reporting.	2	2
You want toast?	2	2
Mama, I already ate.	2	2
You say you're coming to dinner, and you already ate?	2	2
I came because I wanted to see you.	2	2
We never see you.	2	2
I'm here. Right now.	2	2
Such a pretty face.	2	2
Mmm. Gladys Rhine was asking for you at church.	2	2
Babe saw your brassiere ads in the newspaper.	2	2
You should see poor Donny. His skin is horrible.	2	2
Clearasil.	2	2
He's beyond that. It's a shame.	2	2
He's a handsome boy.	2	2
Lots of people was asking me about you.	2	2
Doesn't mean the same thing to me that it means to you.	2	2
I think your father would like it if you lit a candle for him.	2	2
I pray for you.	2	2
You know she lies and tells people	2	2
you're out of town on business.	2	2
She has some made-up church in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,	2	2
where you go to mass with a friend of hers.	2	2
No one asked her to lie.	2	2
She's not gonna be here forever.	2	2
Would it kill you to go?	2	2
I don't want to.	2	2
And I'm capable of making my own decisions.	2	2
Really? State of New York didn't think so.	2	2
The doctors didn't think so.	2	2
Did you bring the vacuum?	2	2
Yes.	2	2
Did you empty the bag?	2	2
Yes.	2	2
How do you let her get away with making a bid of 150?	2	2
She usually overbids. How was I supposed to know?	2	2
I do not overbid. I'm cautious.	2	2
I hear it's gonna be a row of apartments all up Cedar Lane.	2	2
No more cedars.	2	2
No parking around the school.	2	2
You know, I could've had that property for a song?	2	2
A song and a half, tops.	2	2
I thought he was crazy, but there you go.	2	2
I'm sure we have something else to talk about.	2	2
Oh, did you hear about that jetliner?	2	2
Terrible. It's terrible.	2	2
I was supposed to fly to Cleveland. Now I can't.	2	2
I have to take the train.	2	2
Nine hours.	2	2
You have got to be kidding.	2	2
Sorry.	2	2
I love the train. You do, too.	2	2
Bobby.	2	2
Go back to bed.	2	2
[running footsteps, door closes]	2	2
I'm scared. I heard something.	2	2
Everything's great. Go back to bed.	2	2
Bobby.	2	2
Come on.	2	2
Do what your mother says.	2	2
[grunts]	2	2
When I was a child,	2	2
I would've been way more afraid of my father	2	2
than of going to sleep.	2	2
I hated going to sleep when I was a kid.	2	2
But I bet you did when you were told.	2	2
Mm-hmm, with a stack of comics and a flashlight.	2	2
I don't care what they do when they're up there.	2	2
I just like a few hours of quiet.	2	2
Ernie tests my patience.	2	2
Said he saw a ghost.	2	2
He was scared.	2	2
He's a little liar.	2	2
He is?	2	2
He drew the most amazing picture	2	2
of George Washington the other day.	2	2
His teacher was so impressed,	2	2
she put it up in the hallway.	2	2
It really looked like him.	2	2
Well, obviously.	2	2
Because he brought it home, and I noticed	2	2
the exact same image of Washington	2	2
on the cover of one of his books.	2	2
He had traced it.	2	2
What happened?	2	2
He brought a book to school so he could trace it?	2	2
Well, I don't know. Maybe they had it there.	2	2
I mean, the point is it was dishonest.	2	2
My whole art department is run on tracing paper.	2	2
Why reinvent the wheel?	2	2
I've got the rest.	2	2
I don't care about tracing.	2	2
What about all that praise he accepted	2	2
for something he didn't do?	2	2
Well, the book says they start fibbing at this age.	2	2
They want to see if they can make it come true.	2	2
[scoffs]	2	2
I don't need a book to know what little boys do.	2	2
You have anything you want me to take back to the library?	2	2
Anything you want me to pick up?	2	2
No. I have to renew The Agony and the Ecstasy.	2	2
It's taking forever.	2	2
I should go. I have to work tomorrow.	2	2
Busy bee.	2	2
Aren't you going to say good night?	2	2
Hi, Aunt Peggy.	2	2
Marilyn says Helen Bishop's trying to stop them	2	2
from putting parking meters at Depot Plaza.	2	2
Apparently, she got chummy	2	2
with some administrator at the high school.	2	2
Big, fat fellow.	2	2
Carlton's put on a few.	2	2
I think it's nice he's filled out.	2	2
It shows he's happy.	2	2
I wouldn't say that.	2	2
Why not?	2	2
Did he say something? What did he say?	2	2
He didn't say anything.	2	2
Well, he should be happy.	2	2
Okay, maybe he is.	2	2
He should be happy and grateful	2	2
and showering Francine with love after what he put her through.	2	2
Look, Bets, I'm not going to fight.	2	2
I'll say whatever you think I should say,	2	2
but I'm not going to fight with you.	2	2
[chuckles]	2	2
What, sweetheart? Hmm?	2	2
You laughed. What's funny?	2	2
Oh. I just...	2	2
I was just thinking that	2	2
the last conversation I had with him,	2	2
we were arguing about whether Barney Kellogg	2	2
bred Boston terriers or French bulldogs.	2	2
I'm sorry you were arguing.	2	2
Those ugly little pushed-in faces.	2	2
The labored breathing.	2	2
He said they were French bulldogs.	2	2
I said they were Boston terriers.	2	2
He was angry about it.	2	2
Oh, Peter, neither of you knew it was the last time.	2	2
Fighting about facts, my mother calls it.	2	2
We do it all the time.	2	2
Argue over something	2	2
that's actually one thing or another.	2	2
What do Barney's dogs look like?	2	2
Just beige.	2	2
Kind of like pugs, but with big ears.	2	2
Those are French bulldogs.	2	2
Really?	2	2
Mm-hmm.	2	2
When I woke up, I felt fine for a minute.	2	2
Then I remembered.	2	2
You should be thinking about the good times.	2	2
Right.	2	2
So they go out a third time,	2	2
and now the restaurant's even worse... Indian food.	2	2
But she really likes him.	2	2
I told you he worked for City Hall, for the Mayor.	2	2
So what happened? I need three copies.	2	2
One goes to Mr. Robinson, one to Mr. Fairbanks,	2	2
and one to Mr. Smith.	2	2
The strange one.	2	2
That doesn't narrow it down.	2	2
Thank you.	2	2
Mr. Kinsey.	2	2
Is something wrong?	2	2
I'm avoiding you.	2	2
Or haven't you noticed that after three days?	2	2
Are you worried about the typewriter?	2	2
I'm not going to tell anyone.	2	2
Although you were so brazen, you don't deserve clemency.	2	2
What did you say to Sheila?	2	2
Who? Sheila.	2	2
My girlfriend.	2	2
Describe her to me.	2	2
Very funny.	2	2
I know what's first on the list.	2	2
Oh, my God. I knew you were	2	2
a lot of things... I'm not a phony.	2	2
You're so proud.	2	2
It's so obvious why you're seeing her.	2	2
A supermarket checkout girl?	2	2
Conversation must be stimulating.	2	2
Lettuce costs a nickel.	2	2
What a relief. You're just jealous.	2	2
Because you're the one who got away?	2	2
You, out there in your poor-little-rich-boy apartment	2	2
in Newark or wherever.	2	2
Walking around with your pipe and your beard,	2	2
falling in love with that girl	2	2
just to show how interesting you are.	2	2
Go ahead. What part is wrong?	2	2
[knocking]	2	2
Pete?	2	2
Duck. Come in.	2	2
Where's the girl?	2	2
She's supposed to tell me if she goes anywhere.	2	2
When my old man died, I went on a hell of a bender.	2	2
Oh. You heard about that.	2	2
I had to read about it in the Times.	2	2
I wish you felt that you could talk to me about it.	2	2
You should be able to.	2	2
We're practically family here.	2	2
Oh, I don't know, Duck.	2	2
There's not a lot to say.	2	2
No. Of course not.	2	2
Your old man was in advertising, right?	2	2
Boston.	2	2
Used to talk about the '20s like we're idiots.	2	2
My father wasn't.	2	2
Of course, it turns out I really didn't know anything about him	2	2
except that he did not like advertising.	2	2
Ah, that's his style. I'm sure he was proud of you.	2	2
Some people have trouble saying it.	2	2
Yes. That was a problem for him.	2	2
What's not to be proud of?	2	2
You pay attention. You're hungry.	2	2
Most of the time you know what you're doing.	2	2
I've noticed that.	2	2
Oh. I appreciate that.	2	2
Now, I don't want you to think I'm being insensitive,	2	2
but we're going after American Airlines.	2	2
Well, it's...	2	2
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.	2	2
Okay.	2	2
I'm meeting at the University Club with Shel Keneally.	2	2
Tonight, actually. Get everything rolling.	2	2
If anything, I'd like you on board.	2	2
I want you leading the way on this thing.	2	2
I think I am uncomfortable.	2	2
I don't think I should do that.	2	2
It just happened.	2	2
I haven't even cried yet.	2	2
Of course.	2	2
It was inappropriate.	2	2
I'm sorry for your loss.	2	2
Can you come in here with the papers I asked for?	2	2
[Roger] Sweetheart.	2	2
You mind?	2	2
I need you to set a meeting.	2	2
A quiet place, but public.	2	2
Have a heart-to-heart with Henry Lamont.	2	2
Why would I do that?	2	2
Because we're cutting him loose.	2	2
Duck's having a meeting with Shel Keneally from American Airlines tonight.	2	2
He's letting them know that Mohawk is over.	2	2
And that gets us a pitch?	2	2
It sends a signal that we're serious.	2	2
And that we're willing to do whatever it takes.	2	2
He has nothing. And this is more of it.	2	2
It's desperate. Come on.	2	2
You should be salivating to rip these guys away from DDB.	2	2
And even if we don't win this account,	2	2
we're going to be on a list in the New York Times	2	2
of big boys pitching for this business.	2	2
We have an airline.	2	2
What kind of company are we going to be?	2	2
The kind where everyone has a summer house?	2	2
I can't believe I look like an idiot	2	2
for wanting to be loyal to these people.	2	2
Oh, take off your dress.	2	2
You get a chance at American Airlines, you take it.	2	2
End of discussion.	2	2
Hildy, can you get my wife on the phone?	2	2
Of course.	2	2
Forget it.	2	2
[no audible dialogue]	2	2
Mr. Campbell.	2	2
Don. Do you have a minute?	2	2
What do you want, Campbell?	2	2
I just was... I don't know.	2	2
It's not a good time.	2	2
If you want, you can leave him a note.	2	2
People do that.	2	2
No.	2	2
Thank you.	2	2
[women laughing]	2	2
Good night, Joan.	2	2
Did you see who did this?	2	2
No.	2	2
I never would have guessed you were in your 30s.	2	2
People should not bring their personal problems into the office.	2	2
I agree.	2	2
Is it so hard to just leave everything	2	2
at the door and just do your job?	2	2
I look forward to it.	2	2
They can't stand it.	2	2
They'll drag you into the garbage out there.	2	2
They just want you to be as miserable as they are.	2	2
I say let them have it.	2	2
♪♪ [traditional Japanese]	2	2
Thanks.	2	2
How are you, Don?	2	2
Henry.	2	2
Sit down.	2	2
Can I get you anything?	2	2
You know, I'm glad you picked this place.	2	2
It reminds me of Pearl Harbor.	2	2
For many reasons.	2	2
Do you think you're not going to have to say it?	2	2
Sterling Cooper has decided	2	2
to end its relationship with Mohawk Airlines.	2	2
Sterling Cooper.	2	2
I'm sorry.	2	2
It wasn't my decision.	2	2
You know, when we came in there,	2	2
they all said Sterling Cooper is Don Draper.	2	2
That's what you get.	2	2
That talk you gave me about us growing together.	2	2
You said Sterling Cooper didn't need a big airline.	2	2
You were going to make us a big airline.	2	2
I wish things hadn't worked out this way.	2	2
I'm almost embarrassed to say this.	2	2
You fooled me.	2	2
Stockholders weren't remotely impressed	2	2
with firing our head of ops.	2	2
So this agency change, well, that's going to be a process.	2	2
And to be part of that process?	2	2
Listen, we're here talking, right? Of course.	2	2
But it's hard for me to leave here comfortable	2	2
unless I know what your objections are.	2	2
Well, we're a few steps away from objections.	2	2
We're just sticking a toe in the water.	2	2
Well, we're not. We jumped in.	2	2
Pete.	2	2
It's good to see you.	2	2
Shel, this is Pete Campbell.	2	2
I don't think he's our best.	2	2
I think he's the best.	2	2
Pleased to meet you.	2	2
You as well.	2	2
I was just telling my buddy Shel here	2	2
how we've really cleared the way to be in this.	2	2
I was telling Duck here	2	2
we don't know where we are yet.	2	2
I don't think you're aware	2	2
of the level of commitment and enthusiasm	2	2
for this project at Sterling Cooper.	2	2
It's true.	2	2
We've got writers bucking the gate.	2	2
I've already got a stack of ideas on my desk	2	2
that I think you'd love to see.	2	2
We understand how delicate	2	2
the process of rebuilding the public's confidence will be.	2	2
Not just the public. Our stockholders.	2	2
Well, I want you to know that,	2	2
should you decide to bring us your business,	2	2
there will be someone on your account	2	2
who knows exactly what you're going through.	2	2
My father was on that plane.	2	2
My goodness.	2	2
Sorry to hear that.	2	2
Yes. Well... it's a horrible thing.	2	2
Hopefully, something good will come of it.	2	2
That is something I will pass on.	2	2
Shall we grab a bite?	2	2
I put our name in.	2	2
"♪♪ [""Sukiyaki""]"	2	2
I'm not your waitress, but are you all set here?	2	2
Excuse me?	2	2
You've been sitting alone a long time.	2	2
Can I get you a menu?	2	2
I don't think so.	2	2
I have to drop this off,	2	2
but I can swing back around on my way out.	2	2
Not tonight.	2	2

No.	2	3

This is a nice place for nice people,	2	3
and the jerk behind the bar, he throws a bowl of nuts at me.	2	3
What am I, a squirrel?	2	3
Well, lucky for him, I bring my own wherever I go.	2	3
Am I crazy? I don't think so.	2	3
Just you try and stick your face into a can of nuts.	2	3
Take it from a nut.	2	3
Utz are better than nuts.	2	3
Don't cut. No. I want to do that again.	2	3
Roll the camera over that way 5 feet and come in around the lapels.	2	3
Quiet, please.	2	3
Still rolling.	2	3
Just try sticking your face into a can of nuts.	2	3
 Here we are in Lakehurst, New Jersey,	2	3
watching as the great airship Hindenburg	2	3
attempts to tie off its mooring mast and...	2	3
Oh, my God! She suddenly burst into flames!	2	3
Oh, God! Look at the size of it!	2	3
It's horrible! Oh, the humanity!	2	3
Hey, get Sitting Bull on the phone.	2	3
We found the last buffalo.	2	3
Hey, get a wider lens, right?	2	3
We want to shoot her in CinemaFat.	2	3
Hey, Jimmy, what do you say we take a little break?	2	3
Open your mouth, sweetheart.	2	3
I want to see if Gepetto's building a fire in there.	2	3
That man is an animal.	2	3
Jesus, Jimmy.	2	3
Just for your information, this guy's laughing over here.	2	3
Are you going right home?	2	3
No.	2	3
I have marketing.	2	3
I have to pick up Don's watch.	2	3
- You bought Don a watch? - I got it repaired.	2	3
He was bathing the kids with it.	2	3
I've been looking for one for Raymond.	2	3
- We're coming up on 10, you know. - 10?	2	3
Poor man has to think of something for the girl who has everything.	2	3
Did you make any suggestions?	2	3
I do love your car.	2	3
That's not romantic.	2	3
Did you hear the part where I said 10 years?	2	3
I shouldn't be saying that.	2	3
He looks like a little boy.	2	3
I guess.	2	3
He reminds me of Monty Clift in A Place in the Sun,	2	3
learning how to ride so he can worm his way into the upper crust.	2	3
Somewhere there's a pregnant girl floating in a lake.	2	3
I'm from the South. There are such people.	2	3
I think he needs a different horse.	2	3
He's on the worst one we have.	2	3
I apologize.	2	3
I knew it would be a challenge, or I would have done it myself.	2	3
Thank you, Gertie.	2	3
You have to admit... he is handsome.	2	3
He's got that going for him.	2	3
Shall we?	2	3
I have to get my purse.	2	3
No. You're not going anywhere.	2	3
We have to meet her.	2	3
Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Carson,	2	3
this is Tara Montague, my fianc?e.	2	3
Sarah Beth Carson.	2	3
Betty Draper.	2	3
You must be the ladies he rides with.	2	3
We're among them.	2	3
Artie, are you the rooster around here?	2	3
I think they make fun of me.	2	3
We don't. That would be cruel.	2	3
Well, I've done plenty of things for him.	2	3
And I'd love to continue doing so.	2	3
Pleased to meet you.	2	3
She's pretty.	2	3
Very pretty.	2	3
Prettier than I expected.	2	3
I think she's about right.	2	3
I spend too much time here.	2	3
I actually dreamt about him.	2	3
I think it was him,	2	3
or a version of him that could ride.	2	3
I'll see you Saturday.	2	3
No. You'll have him to yourself on Saturday.	2	3

Thank you.	2	3
You've never opened one of these, have you?	2	3
Hey, Todd.	2	3
Yes, Mr. Crane?	2	3
Nothing. Get the door, will you?	2	3
Damn it.	2	3
Whoa.	2	3
You in the middle of something?	2	3
We're going to the Oyster Bar.	2	3
Yeah. I'm not hungry.	2	3
Hello.	2	3
Good. You are home.	2	3
Never got any better.	2	3
I almost threw up waiting for our elevator	2	3
and then just came back and got undressed.	2	3
Sorry.	2	3
But aren't you sweet to call and check up on me.	2	3
Harry?	2	3
Harry?	2	3
What's wrong?	2	3
You told me you wanted me to tell me if I was upset.	2	3
What did I do?	2	3
Oh, no, honey.	2	3
No, it's nothing.	2	3
You do sound upset.	2	3
Something is wrong.	2	3
Harry, do I want to hear this?	2	3
Would you stop? Let me talk?	2	3
Okay. Were you fired?	2	3
I accidentally opened Ken Cosgrove's paycheck.	2	3
So?	2	3
What's he gonna care?	2	3
Tampering with the U.S. Mail?	2	3
He makes 300 a week.	2	3
What? That mannequin makes $300 a week?	2	3
He's not married.	2	3
We have one on the way.	2	3
I hate this place.	2	3
I should quit.	2	3
That's your response?	2	3
The hours you work?	2	3
Forget about Kenny.	2	3
If they have that much money to spend, they should spend it on you.	2	3
You're making that place.	2	3
I don't know about that.	2	3
What are you worth?	2	3
You go in there and ask for it.	2	3
Demand it.	2	3
Be polite, but think about what you're worth to them.	2	3
No. No, I can't do that.	2	3
I didn't know this was about you feeling sorry for yourself.	2	3
I'm hanging up.	2	3
Do you know where I can get a number 10 envelope	2	3
with a windowpane and a green stripe on the side?	2	3
No.	2	3
I need to lay down.	2	3
Yeah. Right.	2	3
Well, feel better.	2	3
Do you have a number 10 envelope with a windowpane?	2	3
No. Why?	2	3
Can you make one?	2	3
No. Why?	2	3
Can you fix this one?	2	3
Make it so it can look unopened?	2	3
You need a fake passport, too?	2	3
I got Ken Cosgrove's paycheck by mistake.	2	3
I opened it.	2	3
How did that happen?	2	3
A mistake.	2	3
Well, just throw it away.	2	3
He'll ask for it by the end of the day,	2	3
and they'll cut him a new one.	2	3
Don't throw it away here, though.	2	3
People go through the trash.	2	3
Of course.	2	3
Are you upset about getting caught?	2	3
Or are you upset about what you saw?	2	3
I don't know if this would mean much to you.	2	3
It's 300 a week before taxes.	2	3
We're married.	2	3
I have a baby due in August.	2	3
You know what Jennifer said?	2	3
She thinks that I should just go in and demand a raise.	2	3
You told your wife about this?	2	3
I know. I do that. I keep doing it.	2	3
- I didn't know what to do. - There's nothing you can do.	2	3
That's why you don't tell your wife.	2	3
Wish you hadn't told me.	2	3
I think she's right.	2	3
But isn't Media a meritocracy?	2	3
You think that?	2	3
What's that supposed to mean, anyway?	2	3
I have plenty of merit.	2	3
Merit defined within reason.	2	3
As in this place can't run without you?	2	3
Well, how the hell do I do that?	2	3
Then you're worth every penny they're paying you.	2	3
Thanks, Sal.	2	3
Mr. Draper, Mr. Sterling and Ben Cosgrove are here to see you.	2	3
Ken.	2	3
Bad news.	2	3
So bad I don't feel like telling you. Cosgrove.	2	3
We were shooting Jimmy Barrett for Utz, and...	2	3
Don't pussyfoot around. Just tell him.	2	3
I'm trying to tell him.	2	3
- Give me a cigarette. - Yes, sir.	2	3
Why don't you get your own?	2	3
We have a whole storeroom full of Luckys.	2	3
Because I don't smoke.	2	3
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling made a surprise visit to the set,	2	3
and they got the full Jimmy Barrett treatment.	2	3
Mr. Rumsen's coming in.	2	3
I don't care that you drink, Freddie,	2	3
- but it's interfering with your job. - Whoa.	2	3
Only an idiot would put Jimmy Barrett in a room with her.	2	3
No visits.	2	3
How bad was it?	2	3
He called her the Hindenburg.	2	3
And he said something about the whale in Pinocchio.	2	3
Did you laugh in front of the Schillings?	2	3
Of course not. I was mortified.	2	3
You know, my mother's heavyset.	2	3
I stopped it right away.	2	3
So what we're dealing with here is you failed to control Jimmy Barrett,	2	3
and you failed to control Mr. And Mrs. Utz,	2	3
so maybe both of you aren't suited for these tasks.	2	3
- Mr. Phillips is here. - Perfect.	2	3
Utz is gonna lose Jimmy, and we're going to lose Utz.	2	3
Oh, God. I miss the '50s.	2	3
Has anyone tried to save this yet besides Leopold and Loeb over here?	2	3
Can't get the Schillings on the phone.	2	3
Someone needs to talk to Jimmy.	2	3
Well, I'm sure he'll feel real bad about it tonight and give her a call.	2	3
Don, can you work him over?	2	3
Jimmy Barrett is a known quantity.	2	3
Don's going to fix it.	2	3
He knows what that nut means to Utz and what Utz means to us.	2	3
Fix what, exactly?	2	3
Fix this mess that was made because Freddie got him drunk.	2	3
Come on. Cosgrove should have told me they were here.	2	3
I would have never let her near that set.	2	3
I did. I told Lois.	2	3
I took them by here, but you were out.	2	3
I'm going to talk to the Schillings,	2	3
then I'm going to explain the facts of life to Jimmy.	2	3
That'll work.	2	3
A guy like that must know how to make a charming apology,	2	3
or he'd be dead.	2	3
Where were you?	2	3
At the printer's.	2	3
You should tell your girl that.	2	3
Lois.	2	3
Close the door.	2	3
Sit down.	2	3
No. Stand.	2	3
I'd like to find a way not to be cruel,	2	3
but I don't think it'd be serving either one of us.	2	3
Are you firing me?	2	3
Oh, no.	2	3
It's nice to see that you care about something.	2	3
Are you trying to think of what you can possibly say	2	3
to make up for what's happened here?	2	3
What happened?	2	3
I think you're not suited for this job.	2	3
What did I do?	2	3
In addition to being incompetent,	2	3
you threatened my reputation, and not just today.	2	3
Mr. Draper, I try to cover for you all the time.	2	3
You do not cover for me.	2	3
You manage people's expectations.	2	3
Can you be more specific?	2	3
You really want that?	2	3
No, I guess not.	2	3
You're not suited for this job.	2	3
It's not an insult. It's just the way it is.	2	3
Stick to the switchboard.	2	3
Please tell Miss Holloway on your way out.	2	3
Yes, Mr. Draper.	2	3
Is there something due tomorrow I don't know about?	2	3
No.	2	3
Already finding ways not to go home, are we?	2	3
Edgar Fladen, CBS, please.	2	3
- Hello. - Flatty.	2	3
Harry Crane. How are you?	2	3
Still at work, same as you.	2	3
How you like it over there?	2	3
Did Sterling Coo lose some of its drunken luster?	2	3
I don't know.	2	3
I was thinking maybe I have to move out to move up.	2	3
Well, forget about here. They're picking us off.	2	3
I'm one gone paleface.	2	3
Well, thought I'd ask.	2	3
Keep your ear to the ground for me, will you?	2	3
- It doesn't have to be there. - Hey, how about some concern?	2	3
I just lost Lever Brothers and Kimberly Clark	2	3
from one of my biggest shows.	2	3
We're lousy with sponsors over here. What do you need?	2	3
Don't get excited.	2	3
Sponsors drop out for a reason.	2	3
Not always.	2	3
Okay. Try this on.	2	3
The Defenders. Top 20 show.	2	3
E.G. Marshall, Bob Reed.	2	3
Lawyers, but, you know, they really care.	2	3
So the writers turn in this script about a cannibal.	2	3
A cannibal lawyer?	2	3
The director eats up all this time refusing to do it,	2	3
like his r?sum? isn't filled with crap,	2	3
and surprise, the writers have only one other script ready...	2	3
something we threw away last year	2	3
"because they used the word ""abortion"" 30 times in 51 minutes."	2	3
Why?	2	3
Because they show one, opening scene.	2	3
Exactly.	2	3
The whole thing was a ploy to get us to shoot it.	2	3
They think they're so clever.	2	3
I tell you, I miss the blacklist.	2	3
Send it over. I want to see it.	2	3
I'm sure.	2	3
It's going on the air, sponsor or no.	2	3
I'll watch it with you in the bar where I'll be working.	2	3
Send it over. Let me see what I can do.	2	3
All right.	2	3
Miss Holloway, good morning.	2	3
I will be taking care of you while we search for a suitable candidate.	2	3
I am really sorry about that.	2	3
Did she leave everything in a condition you can follow?	2	3
Perhaps if you were involved in the selection.	2	3
What can I tell?	2	3
I'll just continue looking for another Miss Olson.	2	3
No. I want someone who'll be happy with that job.	2	3
Well, for the time being, that's me.	2	3
How about a cup of coffee?	2	3
I think I remember how you take it.	2	3
Sure.	2	3
Is Jimmy Barrett shooting today?	2	3
Yes. At EUE.	2	3
What time do they start?	2	3
They were supposed to start this morning,	2	3
but Mr. Barrett's been showing up around 4.	2	3
Wake me at 3:30.	2	3
We'll start with your correspondence.	2	3
Did you go to that office	2	3
for the purpose of obtaining an illegal operation?	2	3
Yes.	2	3
Were you pregnant?	2	3
Yes.	2	3
Then you went to Dr. Montgomery for an abortion.	2	3
Yes.	2	3
Was the abortion performed?	2	3
Just a moment.	2	3
Mr. Preston, aren't you going to object?	2	3
The witness is not a qualified medical expert.	2	3
The defense is willing to concede	2	3
that an operation was performed on Miss Stafford,	2	3
which resulted in the termination of a pregnancy.	2	3
Very well. You may proceed.	2	3
Come here a lot, do you?	2	3
Not if everything's running smoothly.	2	3
So buy me a drink.	2	3
I think there's been plenty of drinking here.	2	3
Jimmy around?	2	3
He left early. Rehearsal at the Copa.	2	3
Forgot this.	2	3
Isn't that our tuxedo?	2	3
He likes it better.	2	3
Great. So let's go talk to him.	2	3
There's no reason for that.	2	3
Talk to his manager.	2	3
How can I help you?	2	3
I'm sorry.	2	3
In the pitch, you were introduced as his wife.	2	3
Would you prefer I pretend to be his sister, like I did in the old days?	2	3
Wife, manager, someone should have kept a lid on him yesterday.	2	3
I've seen the man sober. He's not funny.	2	3
- Mrs. Barrett... - Bobbie.	2	3
He can come in here with vomit in his pockets for all I care,	2	3
but these people are his benefactors.	2	3
Like the Medicis of Florence,	2	3
they're patrons of his art.	2	3
Mr. And Mrs. Utz.	2	3
I want you to imagine something that Jimmy obviously can't.	2	3
The Schillings were very excited to see their favorite comedian.	2	3
Then they know that being picked on by Jimmy Barrett is a compliment.	2	3
No one was laughing.	2	3
That's not what I heard.	2	3
I'll tell you what.	2	3
They're in the big city for the weekend.	2	3
Why don't they just go out and buy a thicker skin?	2	3
You are aware that all of this can go away.	2	3
No more free tuxedos?	2	3
We have a contract.	2	3
Tell Jimmy I need to talk to him.	2	3
You?	2	3
Jimmy doesn't have a lot of patience for business	2	3
or for businessmen.	2	3
In fact, I'm pretty sure he already hates you.	2	3
Really?	2	3
Some glib ad man in that suit,	2	3
cigarette perfectly in hand, not a hair out of place,	2	3
here to tell him he's been a bad boy?	2	3
Well, he has been.	2	3
So what do you suggest I do?	2	3
Well...	2	3
he has to know that you're a fan	2	3
and that he knows more than you	2	3
and that he's got a shot with your wife.	2	3
Girlfriend? Both?	2	3
Wife.	2	3
So who's gonna have a talk with him, you or me?	2	3
Neither of us.	2	3
I have to go.	2	3
Let me drive you over.	2	3
Give up, will you?	2	3
It's raining.	2	3
What's that?	2	3
Hail.	2	3
I don't want to do this.	2	3
Doesn't feel that way.	2	3
Hi, Daddy.	2	3
Hi, Daddy.	2	3
Hey, you.	2	3
How was work?	2	3
Fine.	2	3
Can I ask Daddy?	2	3
What do you want?	2	3
I'm fine.	2	3
You can ask him, but he's not gonna disagree with me.	2	3
Ask me what?	2	3
Can we go riding with Mommy on Saturday?	2	3
No.	2	3
There are just gonna be mommies there.	2	3
I'll need you to watch them.	2	3
- It's a couple of hours. - Okay.	2	3
But she promised.	2	3
"""She""?"	2	3
Not this Saturday. It didn't work out.	2	3
You can ride me around the den.	2	3
I picked up your watch. Good as new.	2	3
Open it.	2	3
I got it monogrammed.	2	3
Wow, Bets.	2	3
Thank you.	2	3
What are you doing?	2	3
I think she's out of gas.	2	3
Thought I'd fill her up.	2	3
They feed them in the barn.	2	3
You're ruining that horse for whoever has her next.	2	3
I want it on record.	2	3
She was ruined when I got to her.	2	3
Just pull up on the reins. Straighten her out.	2	3
You can't let her do that.	2	3
You don't for a minute think you might be hurting her?	2	3
She needs to be told what to do. Don't be afraid.	2	3
I'm not afraid, but I am curious why I'm riding Nehi	2	3
and you've got Copenhagen.	2	3
Some horses have better names.	2	3
Where's your girl friend, Mrs. Carson?	2	3
Her daughter has a ballet recital.	2	3
I'm really not afraid, you know?	2	3
I've just always been more comfortable with animals	2	3
when they were on the other end of my rifle.	2	3
That's a terrible attitude.	2	3
It is, and I've tried to explain it to Tara, but she won't listen.	2	3
All the men in her family ride like this.	2	3
They also don't work, so maybe I'm wrong about it.	2	3
I should go warm him up.	2	3
Tally-ho.	2	3
I'll be right back.	2	3
Hello.	2	3
Hello. It's Don Draper.	2	3
Can you talk?	2	3
I'm glad you called.	2	3
How are you?	2	3
Weren't you afraid you'd get Jimmy?	2	3
No. I wanted to invite you both to dinner.	2	3
Monday night.	2	3
A command performance.	2	3
I was thinking Lut?ce.	2	3
It will be formal. Can you get him there?	2	3
I told you. He does whatever I say.	2	3
Keep it small.	2	3
My wife, the Schillings, you.	2	3
Okay. If that's what you want.	2	3
What do you want?	2	3
So...	2	3
it's that kind of phone call, is it?	2	3
Where are you?	2	3
In my home.	2	3
With my children.	2	3
Really?	2	3
I like being bad and then going home and being good.	2	3
I'll see you Monday.	2	3
Have a wonderful weekend.	2	3
Did you have a nice ride?	2	3
Don't smoke in here. They hate it.	2	3
I don't know.	2	3
Place burns down, I could give this up.	2	3
I assume you're trying to be funny, but most of the people who ride...	2	3
Hold on.	2	3
Mrs. Draper, I'm so sorry. That's not what I meant.	2	3
Just because you don't know what you're doing	2	3
doesn't mean the rest of us are silly.	2	3
I apologize.	2	3
Girls and their horses.	2	3
I can't figure you out.	2	3
Why would you want to do that?	2	3
When Tara came to visit, I could tell she was jealous.	2	3
Of your two old lady friends.	2	3
She certainly seems like a girl who has everything.	2	3
She does.	2	3
When she was at Wellesley,	2	3
she came for a couple of weekends to New Haven.	2	3
I remember those.	2	3
So exciting.	2	3
We got into a kind of pattern where there'd be a warm reunion,	2	3
a football game, and some kind of obscure argument.	2	3
You know, I would soothe and she would pout.	2	3
You know, Mr. Case, having been married for some time,	2	3
I can tell you your fianc?e would be very unhappy	2	3
with you sharing this with a stranger.	2	3
Arthur.	2	3
I don't know why I brought that up.	2	3
I guess I just remembered going home with her that first time.	2	3
Pulling off the Merritt Parkway and hitting this long, private road.	2	3
You know that Scott Fitzgerald story, A Diamond as Big as the Ritz?	2	3
No.	2	3
Her house is a slightly smaller version of my high school.	2	3
And I realized why she was so happy all the time	2	3
and why she was so angry when she didn't get what she wanted.	2	3
All girls are like that.	2	3
- You aren't. - You don't know that.	2	3
You are so beautiful.	2	3
Thank you.	2	3
So different than Tara.	2	3
Tara is very beautiful. You know that.	2	3
She doesn't need anything.	2	3
What she does need, anyone can get her.	2	3
You're nervous about getting married.	2	3
You'll see.	2	3
You don't know what she'll mean to you.	2	3
But I think about you.	2	3
Why would you do that?	2	3
Arthur, I like being around you.	2	3
Don't say anything to ruin that.	2	3
You're so profoundly sad.	2	3
No.	2	3
It's just my people are Nordic.	2	3
Don't do that.	2	3
Don't tell me what to do.	2	3
You're so profoundly sad.	2	3
You're wrong.	2	3
I'm grateful.	2	3
Hey.	2	3
How was it?	2	3
I'm sorry I'm late.	2	3
Thank you for watching them.	2	3
Come in here.	2	3
I should get cleaned up.	2	3
I don't care.	2	3
Listen.	2	3
How do you feel about Lut?ce Monday night?	2	3
Lut?ce?	2	3
Pleased, I guess.	2	3
And you get to meet Jimmy Barrett.	2	3
Why?	2	3
Business.	2	3
Hunt Schilling from Utz Potato Chips and wives.	2	3
Is this one where I talk or I don't talk?	2	3
You need to charm him.	2	3
I need you to be shiny and bright.	2	3
I need a better half.	2	3
Monday night.	2	3
You have plans?	2	3
I'll have to find something to wear.	2	3
It's no notice. No notice at all.	2	3
Birdie, we'll go there alone another time.	2	3
What is it?	2	3
What is it? What's this got to do with you?	2	3
"""He helped me,"" says Sam."	2	3
Is this you?	2	3
They're writing this about you?	2	3
Answer me! Are you mixed up in this?	2	3
- Answer me! - Mr. Mason.	2	3
You keep out of this!	2	3
Sandra Mason.	2	3
I was reading about this.	2	3
I was thanking God that my daughter	2	3
wasn't the kind of a girl that was...	2	3
would be mixed up in anything ugly like this.	2	3
Please, Daddy, don't.	2	3
I was even feeling sorry for the parents of the girls who were involved.	2	3
- Please. Please. - Please?	2	3
18 years old!	2	3
You have to have an illegitimate child	2	3
taken away from you by some filthy doctor!	2	3
Mr. Mason!	2	3
You get out of my house!	2	3
I do want to see the rest of this, but I get the idea.	2	3
Then behave as though you...	2	3
Top 20 show, prime time, for pennies on the dollar.	2	3
And it's the perfect match for Belle Jolie lipstick.	2	3
Really? How does that work?	2	3
Controversy means viewers.	2	3
Women will find a way to watch this.	2	3
Maybe just because they don't want to get left out.	2	3
Is that true?	2	3
There's no doubt in my mind.	2	3
We can talk to them about putting on a warning.	2	3
Research shows rules are made to be broken.	2	3
Thanks, Ken. He has the research.	2	3
This discussion, it's uncomfortable.	2	3
This show is troubling.	2	3
It's catharsis. That's hard to come by.	2	3
What is better than tears to make a girl ready to hear she can be beautiful?	2	3
I'd love to see a spike.	2	3
But what do I do when Hugh Brody asks what the hell this is?	2	3
Belle Jolie is a family company.	2	3
This is not wholesome.	2	3
There are limits to what you can get out of daytime.	2	3
I don't want Belle Jolie to be part of this debate.	2	3
So you think girls who buy lipstick aren't gonna be interested in this?	2	3
I don't care where they stand. So it's political.	2	3
Politics are in. Women will be watching.	2	3
Young women.	2	3
I'm sorry.	2	3
Well, we thought you should know about it.	2	3
I have to say I'm very impressed you brought this to us.	2	3
I wish we were a different kind of company.	2	3
We all work for someone.	2	3
It was a pleasure.	2	3
How's it going?	2	3
Very well, thank you.	2	3
You said you wanted to see me?	2	3
Yes, I did.	2	3
You're Harry Crane, right?	2	3
Yes, I am.	2	3
Certain things have come to my attention.	2	3
Oh, no.	2	3
I heard about it third-hand, and I thought it sounded reckless,	2	3
so I talked to Mr. Cooper.	2	3
Mr. Cooper knows about this?	2	3
I think someone told on you.	2	3
And it backfired.	2	3
- Mitch. - Doesn't matter.	2	3
Cooper thought it showed initiative.	2	3
So you're in here now.	2	3
I'm smiling. What do you want?	2	3
Well...	2	3
I guess, for one thing,	2	3
I think that we should have a television department.	2	3
All the other agencies have them.	2	3
And I think I should run it.	2	3
You're now the head of the Television Department,	2	3
which is comprised solely of you.	2	3
Anything else?	2	3
Well, actually...	2	3
I think I deserve a raise.	2	3
And I think...	2	3
you've already received a sizable reward.	2	3
Let's not get greedy.	2	3
I'm not being greedy.	2	3
Are you arguing with me?	2	3
How much do you make?	2	3
- $200 a week. - Plus drinks.	2	3
Give me a number.	2	3
How about 310?	2	3
No one makes that around here. Not even close.	2	3
How about two and a quarter? Say yes.	2	3
Yes.	2	3
I'll throw in new business cards.	2	3
You drive a hell of a bargain.	2	3
So I finally told them that we really enjoyed visiting,	2	3
but we'd rather stay in a hotel.	2	3
Made my daughter-in-law happier.	2	3
Luckily, we're a long way from those problems.	2	3
Although, I do love the idea of Bobby and Sally	2	3
having apartments and families.	2	3
Where is he?	2	3
Who?	2	3
Jimmy Barrett.	2	3
I...	2	3
No, Hunt.	2	3
I don't think that would be a good idea.	2	3
Edith, please.	2	3
He wants to apologize.	2	3
Oh, dear.	2	3
Well, he certainly picked a nice place.	2	3
Hello, everybody. Sorry we're late,	2	3
but one of us likes to make an entrance.	2	3
Hello. Bobbie Barrett.	2	3
Pleasure.	2	3
- We've met before. - I remember.	2	3
Mr. Draper.	2	3
This is my wife Betty.	2	3
Betty, this is Bobbie and Jimmy Barrett.	2	3
Oh, my. I am such a fan.	2	3
You know, when you imagine someone saying that to you,	2	3
you always hope it's her.	2	3
And this one. My God. Are you two sold separately?	2	3
Look, it's JFK.	2	3
And you're not Jackie, but you're definitely his type.	2	3
I've met him.	2	3
Nice to see you again, Jimmy.	2	3
You remember Hunt and Edith Schilling.	2	3
How could I forget? They bought me a car.	2	3
A pleasure as always.	2	3
And the little lady. Look at you, all dolled up.	2	3
So, what do you do, sweetheart?	2	3
I want to know everything.	2	3
I'm a housewife.	2	3
I bet little birds hang up your laundry.	2	3
And we have a little boy and a little girl.	2	3
Is that everything? Or you want to let my imagination run wild?	2	3
By the way, I loved you in Gentleman's Agreement.	2	3
Good evening, mesdames et messieurs.	2	3
The chef has prepared many sp?cialit?s	2	3
which I will have the pleasure of...	2	3
Just a minute, Monsieur Le Pew.	2	3
Any chance we can get a drink order filled?	2	3
Sorry, everybody, but Jimmy's down a quart.	2	3
Two Johnnie Walkers, rocks. Bobbie, you want anything?	2	3
Dubonnet with a twist.	2	3
And make it fast, while this place is still French.	2	3
I hope you all like spit in your food.	2	3
Come on. I come here all the time.	2	3
Now, I have a few key questions for Mrs. America.	2	3
Remember, Betsy, everything's riding on this.	2	3
So really, what fills your days?	2	3
Eating bonbons?	2	3
Hitting tennis balls with the needy?	2	3
Actually, I spend a lot of my time riding horses.	2	3
It's really a passion for me.	2	3
And for them, I bet.	2	3
So, big horses? Give me an education.	2	3
- You don't want to hear about this. - No, I do.	2	3
Is it the beauty pageant thing where they walk in little bitty steps?	2	3
I'll be right back.	2	3
No. That's dressage.	2	3
I knew that.	2	3
It's the same kind of saddle, but I do jumping.	2	3
You two do any jumping?	2	3
I'm sorry.	2	3
Can you excuse me a moment?	2	3
All this talk about horses?	2	3
What, are you expecting a Chinese baby?	2	3
I don't know what it is,	2	3
but one thing I know is it's not Chinese.	2	3
We're both very proud of you.	2	3
Well, good.	2	3
Because a 121/2% raise is nothing to sneeze at.	2	3
I don't care about the money.	2	3
Well... the money's nice.	2	3
I just can't wait to go into the phone company tomorrow	2	3
and tell the girls that my husband	2	3
is the head of television at Sterling Cooper.	2	3
Do you feel well enough to go in?	2	3
Because you don't have to.	2	3
You're sweet.	2	3
What did you do?	2	3
Well, I took this TV show that no one wanted to sponsor,	2	3
and I told one of our clients about it.	2	3
And you sold it?	2	3
No, but everyone was impressed that I recognized the opportunity.	2	3
What's the show?	2	3
Just some show.	2	3
You wouldn't like it.	2	3
You look great.	2	3
Do I?	2	3
I'm not feeling great.	2	3
Why not?	2	3
I'm gonna be brief	2	3
because I don't like leaving him alone out there.	2	3
They're loving it.	2	3
They're being polite.	2	3
The window for this apology is closing.	2	3
It needs to happen before the appetizers, or they will leave.	2	3
Really?	2	3
Because I was thinking about that,	2	3
so I took a look at Jimmy's contract...	2	3
well, me and a lawyer...	2	3
and I realized Jimmy doesn't have to apologize at all.	2	3
In fact, they're gonna have to pay him, even if they fire him,	2	3
especially because hurt feelings isn't a very good reason.	2	3
So what is this all about?	2	3
I think an apology, and a public one like this one,	2	3
has to be worth $25,000.	2	3
And I want it in the paper.	2	3
Say it's a bonus.	2	3
Believe me, I will ruin him.	2	3
Do what I say.	2	3
- Don't get up. - I wasn't gonna.	2	3
But this one knows about horses. Who knows?	2	3
I've been spending the whole time watching her lips move.	2	3
Well, I hope we haven't ordered yet because there really is something	2	3
that we need to get out of the way.	2	3
He's picking up the check.	2	3
I mean, there's really no debate, is there?	2	3
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling,	2	3
Jimmy has something that he'd like to say to you.	2	3
Honestly, I'd rather eat your chips than anything in this dump.	2	3
They have snails here, you know.	2	3
That's nice to hear.	2	3
Mrs. Schilling... Edith...	2	3
I was out of line the other day.	2	3
I shouldn't have said it to you, and not just 'cause you're married to him.	2	3
I shouldn't have said it to anybody, not in that environment.	2	3
Sweetheart, look at me.	2	3
You, too, Hunt. Can I call you Hunt?	2	3
There's the guy under the lights, and there's me.	2	3
He's made me rich, but he hasn't made me very nice.	2	3
I hope we can put it behind us.	2	3
I know that's what you do.	2	3
I guess I just don't have the stomach for it.	2	3
Well, I'm famished.	2	3
Excuse me.	2	3
Bets, you all right?	2	3
Yes.	2	3
What's wrong?	2	3
Nothing.	2	3
Nothing's wrong.	2	3
I'm just so happy.	2	3
When I said I wanted to be a part of your life...	2	3
this is what I meant.	2	3
We make a great team.	2	3

 I'm not feeling so good.	2	4
That's because you're hung over.	2	4
I can smell it.	2	4
We have supper.	2	4
She's been fasting all day. I need your help.	2	4
And as a rule,	2	4
there is a greater danger in the hidden betrayer	2	4
than in the open foe.	2	4
Is there a draft? I'll close it.	2	4
No, Father.	2	4
Are you with one of these two?	2	4
No.	2	4
Okay, turn around.	2	4
If you see me again and I'm not smiling,	2	4
 I don't think you're gonna like it.	2	4
Now get back in there.	2	4
Are you leaving?	2	4
Just to get some air.	2	4
You don't have to be polite.	2	4
I'm sorry. I didn't want to lie to you in here.	2	4
I'm Father Gill.	2	4
I'm Peggy Olson.	2	4
- Katherine Olson's girl. - Yes.	2	4
Yes, I'm having dinner at your sister's.	2	4
Are you a new priest?	2	4
I'm visiting.	2	4
So are you gonna come back in?	2	4
Yes.	2	4
Hello.	2	4
Good morning, Caroline.	2	4
Yes.	2	4
We're up.	2	4
Barbecue.	2	4
Right.	2	4
Caroline, we went over this.	2	4
Steaks.	2	4
And the kids can eat hot dogs.	2	4
Cancel.	2	4
I'm sorry. What?	2	4
I don't know.	2	4
Jell-O?	2	4
Do you want me to pick something else up?	2	4
Cancel.	2	4
Caroline, hold on a sec.	2	4
I can't.	2	4
Caroline, I feel terrible about this, but Don's not feeling well.	2	4
No. I'm sorry.	2	4
The 22nd?	2	4
Isn't that Easter?	2	4
Good.	2	4
Bye-bye.	2	4
What's with you?	2	4
I don't know.	2	4
I had an amazing dream.	2	4
You're always hogging the TV!	2	4
I don't like baby stuff.	2	4
Get out. We're... sleeping.	2	4
Get some Raisin Bran.	2	4
You can eat it in the den.	2	4
Out!	2	4
Out!	2	4
I should have locked the door.	2	4
Here's number 2, sir.	2	4
Thank you, Jeeves.	2	4
Why are we in the living room?	2	4
Because we live here.	2	4
What did I say about the stereo?	2	4
I wasn't touching it.	2	4
Bobby, I saw you do it.	2	4
- I didn't do it. - Go watch TV, both of you.	2	4
I love this song.	2	4
His voice is like silk,	2	4
and you can really hear the words.	2	4
He makes everything sound like Christmas.	2	4
In high school, I used to love dancing to this song.	2	4
Come dance with me.	2	4
I thought we weren't doing anything today.	2	4
Hurry. It's almost over.	2	4
I hate to think about your reputation in high school.	2	4
Are you going to sit at the table?	2	4
Gerry, could you get it?	2	4
Jesus, Anita, I can't move.	2	4
Watch your language!	2	4
And I don't care if you have to lay there.	2	4
- Put your shoes on! - Little Gerry, get my shoes!	2	4
Do you want me to get the door?	2	4
I can't reach my toes. What am I supposed to do?	2	4
Hello, Father.	2	4
You're not leaving, are you?	2	4
Hello, Father. I'm sorry I'm late.	2	4
I went by Green-Wood to visit my son.	2	4
Well, I would love to meet him.	2	4
It's a cemetery.	2	4
Father, welcome.	2	4
Come, before it gets cold.	2	4
Hello, Father.	2	4
I'm sorry I missed Mass. My back is out.	2	4
He hasn't been feeling well, but he did his part.	2	4
He watched the baby.	2	4
Well, I hope you feel better soon.	2	4
We all do.	2	4
I'm sorry. I gotta lay down.	2	4
Oh, please, please.	2	4
Oh, come.	2	4
Of course, Father.	2	4
Right this way.	2	4
We have you here.	2	4
Gerard! Mikey! Wash your hands!	2	4
They've disappeared.	2	4
Don't wait for them.	2	4
Father, would you honor us and say grace?	2	4
Certainly. Why not?	2	4
O Lord, thank you for this wonderful feast.	2	4
Thank you for these people	2	4
and this parish and their home.	2	4
That was beautiful.	2	4
Are you gonna say grace now?	2	4
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts	2	4
we are about to receive from thy bounty,	2	4
and make us ever mindful of the needs of others.	2	4
Through Christ our Lord.	2	4
Amen.	2	4
Okay.	2	4
Monsignor says you have a beautiful singing voice.	2	4
And you play the harmonica?	2	4
The guitar.	2	4
I actually learned how to play the mandolin	2	4
when I was in Rome.	2	4
And soccer.	2	4
Did you meet the Holy Father?	2	4
Not exactly.	2	4
It's kind of like being in Washington	2	4
and asking if you've met the president.	2	4
But you know when he's in the building.	2	4
Aren't you gonna have one?	2	4
Should I?	2	4
Well, I'm not gonna drink by myself.	2	4
I'll get the sherry.	2	4
I'll get it, Ma.	2	4
I've always wanted to go to Rome.	2	4
Ah, yes, well, Vatican City is one thing,	2	4
but then you realize you're in Italy.	2	4
Peggy works in Manhattan.	2	4
Oh, really?	2	4
What do you do, Peggy?	2	4
She works on Madison Avenue.	2	4
She comes up with the words in advertisements.	2	4
They call it copywriting, Ma.	2	4
Father, I'm glad you're here.	2	4
I didn't know they knew what I did.	2	4
Stop it. No, you should see her work.	2	4
Lipstick, reducing programs, feminine products.	2	4
Mom, not in front of Father.	2	4
She used to do her presentations for us.	2	4
She uses Latin.	2	4
I'm sorry to do this, but I really should go.	2	4
Look at that.	2	4
Well, where are you headed?	2	4
I'll give you a lift. I have a car.	2	4
- To the Fourth Avenue BMT. - Okay.	2	4
It is such an honor to have you in our house.	2	4
And I'm sorry the chicken was overcooked.	2	4
The chicken was perfect, and you know that.	2	4
Go get the Brownie.	2	4
Let me wrap up some cake.	2	4
Thank you, but no, thank you, Anita.	2	4
You've all really made me homesick.	2	4
Father, would you mind?	2	4
"Say ""cheese."""	2	4
- Cheese. - Cheese.	2	4
Brooks, have you made any decision about our immediate future?	2	4
Believe it or not, Daddy,	2	4
Brooks has other interests besides drinking.	2	4
That'll change.	2	4
Would you stop scaring them?	2	4
We're not scared.	2	4
Then how is it you've been engaged for two months	2	4
and you're not running around making wedding plans?	2	4
Because I told you.	2	4
We don't like the idea of having a big wedding.	2	4
It doesn't have to be big.	2	4
We think it's silly.	2	4
You have to invite a bunch of strangers to gawk at us	2	4
to somehow prove our feelings for each other.	2	4
You know, it's embarrassing.	2	4
Brooks?	2	4
Whatever she wants.	2	4
Well, your mother wants a wedding.	2	4
Mommy had a wedding.	2	4
I did.	2	4
Wearing that dress,	2	4
my sister and my mother fussing over me.	2	4
It was the best I ever looked in my life.	2	4
The Pierre.	2	4
I was drunk, and I didn't have a glass of champagne.	2	4
Gliding around in your father's arms.	2	4
You know how good a dancer he is.	2	4
Dancing with Grandpa.	2	4
I don't want you to miss that.	2	4
What are you getting?	2	4
I'll have the mussels with garlic if you do.	2	4
That's sweet.	2	4
Thank you for the ride, Father.	2	4
Peggy, wait.	2	4
Yes?	2	4
I want to ask you about something, and it's personal.	2	4
Okay.	2	4
I have the honor of delivering the sermon next Sunday.	2	4
It's Palm Sunday. That's a biggie.	2	4
I mean, you're on deck for Easter.	2	4
And, well...	2	4
you said you did presentations.	2	4
Can I run some things past you?	2	4
I don't know what I could tell you.	2	4
You must do this all the time.	2	4
Well, I've done it,	2	4
but your monsignor is a tough act to follow.	2	4
I don't know that I'm your audience.	2	4
You were leaving,	2	4
and we ended up having supper together,	2	4
and you're the only person in this parish	2	4
that knows about public speaking.	2	4
This is how God works.	2	4
I find that if I'm prepared	2	4
and I have confidence in what I'm selling,	2	4
that kills the butterflies.	2	4
That's good.	2	4
I'm prepared.	2	4
Do you have any other tips?	2	4
Well, pick somebody and make eye contact with them.	2	4
You'd think it would make you nervous, but it really focuses you.	2	4
Don't they have stuff that you're supposed to talk about?	2	4
Yes, they have stuff.	2	4
Let's just say I'm covered in the content department.	2	4
I can only speak for myself,	2	4
but the sermon is the only part of Mass that's in English,	2	4
and it's very hard to tell sometimes.	2	4
Maybe be simpler?	2	4
Give us a chance of understanding.	2	4
Thank you for the ride.	2	4
I should go. I really do have to work.	2	4
Idle hands.	2	4
It's good to know you.	2	4
Have a great week.	2	4
I hate my feet.	2	4
I love your feet, Mommy.	2	4
Feet? I thought those were water skis.	2	4
Stop it.	2	4
Stop it! Stop it!	2	4
Stop it!	2	4
Great.	2	4
You broke it.	2	4
I didn't mean to.	2	4
You're being wild in the house.	2	4
It's late.	2	4
Everybody, brush your teeth and go to bed.	2	4
I'm hungry.	2	4
You're going to bed.	2	4
We didn't have any dinner.	2	4
It's 7:30.	2	4
Okay. Come downstairs.	2	4
I'll make you some grilled cheese.	2	4
Go.	2	4
- Go. Go. Go. - Come on.	2	4
"And my wife says, ""Duck and cover."""	2	4
Well, look at this.	2	4
Marty, meet Vicky.	2	4
Hello, Marty.	2	4
- Hello. - I've heard so much about you.	2	4
But you didn't tell me about his wonderful head.	2	4
What about it?	2	4
Someone thinks a lot.	2	4
Well, look at that. It's love at first rub.	2	4
My head has been known to make wishes come true.	2	4
Don't get up.	2	4
This is Marty Hasselbach, from Gorton's.	2	4
Nice to meet you. Roger Sterling.	2	4
We were due to meet tomorrow anyway.	2	4
- Love that frozen scrod. - Thank you.	2	4
I'm Vicky, Marty's wife.	2	4
Aren't you a lucky man.	2	4
Yes, I am.	2	4
We were just discussing the male head.	2	4
Is that right?	2	4
I like the Yul Brynner look.	2	4
She does seem to.	2	4
I keep threatening to shave him one morning.	2	4
Just hop in the shower and take it all off.	2	4
Is that right?	2	4
How long have you two been married?	2	4
Five years.	2	4
Second time around. That explains it.	2	4
It's nice to meet you.	2	4
I hope to see you both tomorrow.	2	4
A pleasure.	2	4
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett is here at my desk.	2	4
No. Of course. Send her in.	2	4
Mrs. Barrett. To what do I owe the pleasure?	2	4
May I take your coat?	2	4
No, thank you.	2	4
I'm not sure how they do it in show business,	2	4
but around here we have this nifty gadget	2	4
called an appointment book.	2	4
I was in the neighborhood.	2	4
What did Jimmy do now, ask Eleanor Roosevelt	2	4
how fast her husband ran the hundred-yard dash?	2	4
How are you?	2	4
Busy.	2	4
I have an idea for a television show.	2	4
Congratulations.	2	4
Is it too early to have a drink?	2	4
Let me call for some ice.	2	4
No need.	2	4
How do I make this happen? Where do I go?	2	4
What is it?	2	4
Everyone loves Candid Camera, right?	2	4
Hidden camera situations.	2	4
Only Jimmy's the host,	2	4
and he's Jimmy, you know?	2	4
Not nice.	2	4
It's derivative, with a twist.	2	4
That's what they're looking for.	2	4
It's called Grin and Barrett.	2	4
That's cute.	2	4
I thought it up all by myself.	2	4
ABC's sick about losing Candid Camera.	2	4
But you'd have to get Jimmy out of his contract with Utz.	2	4
I thought about that.	2	4
It's exclusive,	2	4
but they could come on as sponsors.	2	4
Show needs a national sponsor.	2	4
Utz won't do you any good.	2	4
You're a pessimist.	2	4
They could let him out.	2	4
They should want to keep Jimmy happy.	2	4
They don't care.	2	4
But they could be told	2	4
that their spots would have more punch,	2	4
wherever they air,	2	4
if Jimmy's on a hit television show.	2	4
That is very good advice.	2	4
Will you sell the show for me?	2	4
I'm not interested in doing that.	2	4
But I can talk to the Schillings.	2	4
What's this?	2	4
I was thinking how I could avoid becoming bored with you.	2	4
Bobbie. I have work.	2	4
Bullshit.	2	4
It's good.	2	4
But we should sell them on the mascot first.	2	4
The jingle's going to be a cutie.	2	4
Hasselbach's at 3, right?	2	4
Is he bringing the missus?	2	4
Mary, that'll be all for now.	2	4
Roger...	2	4
there is a Mrs. Hasselbach,	2	4
and that's not her.	2	4
I see.	2	4
That makes sense.	2	4
I've got her number if you want it.	2	4
I've got lots of numbers.	2	4
No. That's okay.	2	4
Keep up the good work.	2	4
Daddy!	2	4
You need to shave.	2	4
You need to shave.	2	4
Some people weren't so good today.	2	4
What happened?	2	4
Bobby broke the record player.	2	4
The repair call is going to be $18.	2	4
9 if you want to put it in your car and drag it over there.	2	4
I don't.	2	4
When I asked him about it,	2	4
he said he didn't do it.	2	4
He lied to my face.	2	4
Where is he?	2	4
In his room.	2	4
Go on out.	2	4
Mommy says you broke the hi-fi.	2	4
I believe her.	2	4
Don't do that again.	2	4
I won't.	2	4
That's it?	2	4
"I said to him, ""Wait till your father gets home,"""	2	4
"and that's what he gets... ""Go to sleep."""	2	4
He knows he did something wrong.	2	4
First the shenanigans with the washing machine,	2	4
and now the record player.	2	4
Don, you have to do something.	2	4
He needs a spanking.	2	4
How else is he gonna learn	2	4
the difference between right and wrong?	2	4
That's not the way it works.	2	4
You think you'd be the man you are today	2	4
if your father didn't hit you?	2	4
Can I get something to eat?	2	4
You left this by the bed.	2	4
I'll do it.	2	4
Draper residence.	2	4
Good. You're there. It's Duck.	2	4
Sunday morning. Where else would I be?	2	4
Shel Keneally called me late last night.	2	4
American Airlines already scheduled	2	4
a bunch of pitches for this week.	2	4
Why are we on the calendar for two weeks from now?	2	4
We're not anymore.	2	4
I got us Good Friday first thing.	2	4
Most of the team's already here.	2	4
The rest are on their way.	2	4
My hand!	2	4
Hello?	2	4
Let me look.	2	4
It hurts.	2	4
I walk out of the room for ten seconds?	2	4
Mommy, make it stop.	2	4
He needs to go to the emergency room.	2	4
That was Duck Phillips on the phone.	2	4
American Airlines moved up their presentation.	2	4
- So? - So I have to go in.	2	4
Damn it.	2	4
One child in the emergency room is enough to deal with.	2	4
Take Sally.	2	4
Send Sally to Francine's.	2	4
It's Palm Sunday.	2	4
I am not about to impose on Francine today.	2	4
I want to go with Daddy.	2	4
Hello, Father Gill.	2	4
Come in.	2	4
- Come in. - Father, welcome.	2	4
I'm terribly sorry, Anita, Ms. Olson.	2	4
I can't stay.	2	4
- Oh, no. - Oh, that's terrible.	2	4
We have Tom, Roberta Callahan,	2	4
Mrs. O'Neill, Mrs. Casey.	2	4
Yes, I'm afraid Mrs. Marchetti has taken a turn for the worse.	2	4
I hope you'll forgive me.	2	4
Oh, that poor woman.	2	4
Let me fix you a paper plate.	2	4
Peggy didn't make it?	2	4
Oh, she's sick.	2	4
Oh. Well, could you give her this?	2	4
It is a copy of my sermon.	2	4
She helped me quite a bit,	2	4
and I would love for her to see it.	2	4
Peggy helped you write something?	2	4
Just some tips, really.	2	4
It was very good.	2	4
I felt like I was the only one you were talking to.	2	4
Well, thank you.	2	4
Again, I'm sorry.	2	4
It's so nice he's taken an interest in her.	2	4
Come, let's eat.	2	4
Mr. Phillips and the others are in the conference room.	2	4
I see you've brought a little helper.	2	4
Betty had her hands full today.	2	4
Sally, be good for Miss Holloway.	2	4
Keep her away from the paper cutter.	2	4
Friday morning, the American Airlines folks	2	4
will join us at 10.	2	4
Roger will handle the introductions.	2	4
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Sterling,	2	4
Creative to the right, Accounts to the left,	2	4
starting with myself, then the American Airlines people, then Campbell.	2	4
Pete, you're next to our man Shel Keneally.	2	4
There will be one for each of them.	2	4
We can't get cordovan by Friday, so we're going with maroon.	2	4
Campbell will run the show.	2	4
He has a list of every ad we need in the presentation.	2	4
Art Department needs to make sure	2	4
that every image we use in a comp is an airplane that American has.	2	4
No cutting and pasting planes from other ads.	2	4
They may all look alike to us, but...	2	4
Why are you here?	2	4
I'm head of the Television Department.	2	4
We have 90 minutes to present.	2	4
I'll do the setup...	2	4
the history of American Airlines	2	4
up to and including the crash.	2	4
I'll tee up Creative with what research says	2	4
travelers are waiting to hear from American.	2	4
And then, Don, you do what you do.	2	4
Maybe you could give us a little peek.	2	4
I'm not ready to do that yet.	2	4
I say we show all three campaigns,	2	4
eliminate all possible objections.	2	4
Something for everybody.	2	4
Remember, this isn't the work we have to run in the end.	2	4
This is about winning these guys over.	2	4
Creative.	2	4
In my office.	2	4
You have big ones.	2	4
My mommy has big ones, too.	2	4
And I'm gonna have big ones when I grow up.	2	4
I don't care if we're just selling a point of view,	2	4
but we have to commit to one thing.	2	4
They don't like wiggle room.	2	4
They like to see us blowing up bridges behind us.	2	4
These are the boards for the 60-second television spots.	2	4
Music you can talk over.	2	4
Stewardesses.	2	4
We're gonna bookend every spot	2	4
with the plane taking off and landing	2	4
up, down, no problems,	2	4
everything okay, every commercial.	2	4
Where's that list Duck's buddy Shel gave us	2	4
with all the things that make American different?	2	4
What's that?	2	4
The ad you asked for to recruit stewardesses.	2	4
It equates what should be a glamorous job	2	4
with being a waitress in a tin can.	2	4
Where's the bar of soap, the ticket sleeves?	2	4
Who's doing the in-flight menu?	2	4
I think it's the best menu I've ever written.	2	4
This is in French. How do I know it's right?	2	4
It's right.	2	4
Make up a chef.	2	4
Peggy, did you pick out a china pattern yet?	2	4
Did you find the one from the Queen Mary?	2	4
Yes. But there needs to be a decision if we're doing anything to the logo.	2	4
I don't know.	2	4
We got a lot of bricks,	2	4
but I don't know what the building looks like.	2	4
So how are you, Vicky?	2	4
I'm in a very good mood.	2	4
Well, I hate to sound remedial,	2	4
but I haven't done this since I was in the Navy.	2	4
Been with a girl?	2	4
No. Not that.	2	4
Don't worry.	2	4
The prices may have changed, but the menu's still the same.	2	4
Well, your invoice ran across my desk.	2	4
Look at you.	2	4
The menu hasn't changed.	2	4
Is it open for negotiation?	2	4
I don't want to ruin the magic.	2	4
How about double... plus carfare?	2	4
And I'll assume you live far away.	2	4
That'll be $100.	2	4
But I want everything I want.	2	4
Isn't that the perfect thing to say?	2	4
That's not so bad, is it?	2	4
I have to warn you, I'm not in great health.	2	4
Don't believe what they say.	2	4
No one dies doing this.	2	4
Are you resting?	2	4
Everybody's resting.	2	4
No. I'm thinking.	2	4
Let's have a conversation.	2	4
Is that your maid?	2	4
No. She's my girlfriend.	2	4
Do you kiss her?	2	4
Sometimes.	2	4
Do you lay on top of her?	2	4
You know what, Sally?	2	4
Your daddy's gonna be angry if I don't do my work.	2	4
Okay.	2	4
Just a minute, girls. It's almost your turn.	2	4
You know, we'll get to go anywhere American flies.	2	4
Familiarization.	2	4
We'll have to rent another floor.	2	4
We'll all have our own offices.	2	4
Do you realize we will get to pick out the stewardesses?	2	4
Okay.	2	4
Son of a bitch.	2	4
Stupid little...	2	4
You there.	2	4
Chewing your cud.	2	4
It's one thing to be unladylike.	2	4
It's another to treat our office like a subway platform.	2	4
Pack up your Wrigley's and go home.	2	4
How could it be my gum? My gum's in my mouth.	2	4
This place is a zoo.	2	4
Thank you for getting him out of here for the day.	2	4
Lose the gum, then get yourself some dinner.	2	4
He won't remember firing you.	2	4
American Airlines is not about the past any more than America is.	2	4
Ask not about Cuba. Ask not about the bomb.	2	4
We're going to the moon.	2	4
Throw everything out.	2	4
Everything?	2	4
There is no such thing as American history,	2	4
only a frontier.	2	4
That crash happened to somebody else.	2	4
It's not about apologies for what happened.	2	4
It's about those seven men in the room on Friday	2	4
and what airline they are going to be running.	2	4
So what does that mean?	2	4
Let's pretend we know what 1963 looks like.	2	4
Jesus, Draper, make a decision.	2	4
What's that leave us with, introductions?	2	4
If I can't mention the crash,	2	4
there's no preamble at all.	2	4
Let it go.	2	4
Our job is to bend down the branch.	2	4
Let him pick the fruit.	2	4
That champagne is probably near frozen.	2	4
I'm meeting a friend.	2	4
You know what I really want?	2	4
Is there something we left out?	2	4
Have dinner with me?	2	4
I told you I'm meeting a friend.	2	4
I'll pay for his meeting, too.	2	4
You wouldn't think dinner would be pushing it on the extras?	2	4
Have you been to Lut?ce yet?	2	4
I have.	2	4
I think you'd like it.	2	4
I've got it.	2	4
It's great, but they're cheeky.	2	4
They started with this prix fixe menu at lunch.	2	4
8.50 for lunch.	2	4
And they have these wines.	2	4
What kind of wine do you like?	2	4
I don't know. Red?	2	4
They're going to make you be more specific than that.	2	4
We can walk, if you don't mind a little rain.	2	4
You know what?	2	4
I love the sound of cabs whooshing in the water.	2	4
Shall we?	2	4
Isn't this a nice town?	2	4
Absolutely.	2	4
She's here on a Sunday, and I respect that,	2	4
but you know she's earning more than all of us.	2	4
Come on.	2	4
Up.	2	4
Good night, ladies.	2	4
Thanks for baby-sitting.	2	4
I'm going home. Be good, Peaches.	2	4
Your sister wants to talk.	2	4
Hey, Pegs.	2	4
Okay.	2	4
It was good.	2	4
He gave us a copy of his sermon to give to you.	2	4
Okay. So long.	2	4
It's nice that he can get to know her without all her troubles.	2	4
She's such a beautiful young girl.	2	4
She does whatever she feels like with no regard at all.	2	4
You're too easy on her. You know that.	2	4
Is Gerry warming up the car?	2	4
Shel Keneally was fired this morning.	2	4
What?	2	4
The rest are on their way in.	2	4
What's going on?	2	4
It's over.	2	4
So why are they coming in?	2	4
Because they have to.	2	4
And we have to deliver a stillborn baby.	2	4
Mr. Phillips, the gentlemen are here from American Airlines.	2	4
Send them in.	2	4
In the name of the Father, the Son,	2	4
and the Holy Spirit, amen.	2	4
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.	2	4
It's been two weeks since my last confession.	2	4
I took something that didn't belong to me.	2	4
Go on.	2	4
I was in the Laundromat,	2	4
and I took some coins off the machine	2	4
and used them.	2	4
I took the Lord's name in vain three times,	2	4
and...	2	4
and I am so angry, Father.	2	4
I am so angry at my little sister.	2	4
She's causing my mother so much pain.	2	4
She had a child out of wedlock.	2	4
She seduced a married man.	2	4
It's a terrible sin,	2	4
and she acts like it didn't even happen.	2	4
And I hate her for it.	2	4
And I feel so guilty about it.	2	4
But everyone keeps falling all over themselves	2	4
trying to help her.	2	4
And she goes on like nothing happened.	2	4
Nothing at all.	2	4
What about me, Father?	2	4
My troubles?	2	4
What about me being good?	2	4
For what?	2	4
I understand it's difficult.	2	4
You know it's not your place to judge.	2	4
God sees your goodness.	2	4
It doesn't feel that way, Father.	2	4
Try to trust God on this.	2	4
You will get your reward in heaven.	2	4
God loves you,	2	4
and he knows that you love your sister.	2	4
I do.	2	4
Say three Hail Marys and two Our Fathers.	2	4
And try to forgive your sister.	2	4
She's not as strong as you are.	2	4
Would you like to make your Act of Contrition?	2	4
O my God,	2	4
I am heartily sorry for having offended thee.	2	4
I detest all my sins	2	4
because I dread the loss of heaven...	2	4
Cooper walked them to the elevator.	2	4
They acted impressed.	2	4
I just can't believe it.	2	4
Here. You should have this.	2	4
No regrets, fellas.	2	4
We were in it. That's the important thing.	2	4
It's heartbreaking.	2	4
Still, good work, Don.	2	4
Come on.	2	4
We hired him to bring in new business,	2	4
not lose old business.	2	4
Don't you love the chase?	2	4
Sometimes it doesn't work out.	2	4
Those are the stakes.	2	4
But when it does work out...	2	4
it's like having that first cigarette.	2	4
Head gets all dizzy.	2	4
Your heart pounds, knees go weak.	2	4
Remember that?	2	4
Old business is just old business.	2	4
You're home early.	2	4
It's Good Friday.	2	4
How did it go?	2	4
It didn't.	2	4
Bobby, stop playing with the robot.	2	4
Do you want to talk about it?	2	4
No.	2	4
How was your day?	2	4
My father called. He's doing better.	2	4
He and William played golf yesterday.	2	4
William made a show of paying for it.	2	4
Bobby, what did I just say?	2	4
It was a accident.	2	4
You don't listen. Don, do something.	2	4
Is that what you wanted?	2	4
You take no responsibility for anything that goes on in this house.	2	4
I pay the bills, put clothes on your back,	2	4
your damn stables.	2	4
Don't you dare.	2	4
I'm here all day.	2	4
Alone with them, outnumbered.	2	4
What about Carla? Doesn't she count?	2	4
It's not her job to raise our children!	2	4
I'm here, and then you come home and get to be the hero.	2	4
You want me to bring home	2	4
what I got at the office today?	2	4
I'll put you through that window.	2	4
Brush your teeth. It's bedtime.	2	4
Bobby, it's not a good time.	2	4
I'm sorry.	2	4
It's okay.	2	4
Dads get mad sometimes.	2	4
Did your daddy get mad?	2	4
He did.	2	4
What did your daddy look like?	2	4
Like me.	2	4
But bigger.	2	4
What did he like to eat?	2	4
Ham.	2	4
And this candy.	2	4
It tasted like violets.	2	4
Had a beautiful purple and silver package.	2	4
What did he do?	2	4
I told you. He was a farmer.	2	4
But he died.	2	4
A long time ago.	2	4
We have to get you a new daddy.	2	4
Come here.	2	4
You have nothing to say?	2	4
What do you want to hear?	2	4
Something.	2	4
Anything.	2	4
How about you're going to help raise these children,	2	4
not be one?	2	4
Bets,	2	4
you do whatever you want.	2	4
It's not about what I do.	2	4
He's a little kid.	2	4
My father beat the hell out of me.	2	4
All it did was make me fantasize	2	4
about the day I could murder him.	2	4
I didn't know that.	2	4
And I wasn't half as good as Bobby.	2	4
Happy Easter, Peggy.	2	4
Hello, Father.	2	4
I read your sermon. I liked it.	2	4
It was very colloquial.	2	4
You were very helpful.	2	4
These kids.	2	4
For the little one.	2	4
Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA	2	4
Mr. And Mrs. Campbell,	2	5
I'm Dr. Stone.	2	5
And how are we today?	2	5
We're so pleased to be here.	2	5
My friend, Sara Driscoll,	2	5
her father is head of Obstetrics at Lenox Hill.	2	5
She said you get results.	2	5
They got results.	2	5
Sometimes all a young couple needs is a good old-fashioned hand-holding.	2	5
Have a seat, Mr. Campbell.	2	5
Now, I am going to ask you some questions together	2	5
 and more intimate ones separately.	2	5
How long have you been trying to conceive?	2	5
Eighteen months.	2	5
That sounds like a long time. Is it?	2	5
Let's not worry about what's normal.	2	5
Everyone is different.	2	5
Are you two aware of the principles of conception?	2	5
Of how the sperm meets the egg?	2	5
Yes.	2	5
Although if you'd like to show us some films...	2	5
You'd be surprised.	2	5
Prior to the decision to conceive, were you using birth control?	2	5
- She was. - I used a diaphragm.	2	5
Although it's possible I didn't need to.	2	5
 Mrs. Campbell.	2	5
So we're walking in the park after lunch,	2	5
and he sees these birds picking seeds out of some horse shit,	2	5
"and he says, ""Move over, fellows. That's my job."""	2	5
That sounds like a visit from the stork or De Beers.	2	5
Or it could be just a new hairdo.	2	5
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Draper.	2	5
How are you this morning?	2	5
Joan. Morning.	2	5
Well, there's your answer.	2	5
- Ever had mumps? - Yes.	2	5
How old were you?	2	5
Summer of '45...	2	5
11, 12.	2	5
Did your testicles descend normally?	2	5
Absolutely.	2	5
And have you ever fathered a child?	2	5
No.	2	5
Have you ever had difficulty completing the sexual act?	2	5
Drinking doesn't help.	2	5
But no.	2	5
I always reach home base.	2	5
Do you have difficulties with arousal?	2	5
Jesus.	2	5
I'm a red-blooded American male, okay?	2	5
No one is questioning your manhood, Mr. Campbell.	2	5
You could be a warrior,	2	5
an athlete, a bull of a man.	2	5
George Washington was sterile.	2	5
Fertility has nothing to do with manliness.	2	5
Do you want to have a child?	2	5
What kind of question is that?	2	5
Of course I do.	2	5
What man doesn't want a child?	2	5
Although you think about the world right now.	2	5
The bomb...	2	5
Do you worry about the world?	2	5
Occasionally.	2	5
Do you work with X-rays, radioactive material,	2	5
or toxic chemicals?	2	5
I'm in advertising.	2	5
We got a Xerox machine, but I don't use it.	2	5
Not personally.	2	5
Advertising?	2	5
Must be a lot of fun.	2	5
Are you kidding?	2	5
I'm an account man.	2	5
I spend half my day tiptoeing around creative crybabies	2	5
and the other half drinking with ungrateful turnips	2	5
who just fell off the truck.	2	5
I'm completely replaceable,	2	5
even though I just brought in a huge account.	2	5
Then you throw this baby thing on top of it,	2	5
the economy contracting, my in-laws...	2	5
Yes, it's a lot.	2	5
What about your parents?	2	5
My father just passed away.	2	5
I'm sorry to hear that.	2	5
Do you think that has something to do with this?	2	5
It doesn't.	2	5
I mean...	2	5
I try not to think about it.	2	5
It's been a few months.	2	5
It is a difficult moment in the life cycle.	2	5
But we are part of a continuum, aren't we?	2	5
So maybe I'm the end of the line.	2	5
Well, that'll do it, Mr. Campbell.	2	5
I think I feel better already.	2	5
Can you send in your wife?	2	5
And then I'd like you to schedule a time with a nurse	2	5
for a semen analysis.	2	5
Whenever she's free.	2	5
Red and green are my colors, so we're gonna do Christmas.	2	5
He doesn't know that yet.	2	5
I can cover Mr. Draper's desk for you.	2	5
I know you'll have your hands full.	2	5
You had your shot.	2	5
It's beautiful.	2	5
Miss Holloway, those aren't wedding bells.	2	5
I'm so sorry, Mr. Draper.	2	5
Mr. Draper's office.	2	5
One moment, please.	2	5
Mr. Draper, Bobbie Barrett on line 1.	2	5
Thank you.	2	5
Don, I want you to ask me how I am.	2	5
How are you?	2	5
Where are you right now?	2	5
I'm in my office,	2	5
where you called me.	2	5
You sound a little tipsy.	2	5
We did it.	2	5
We sold Grin and Barrett.	2	5
Congratulations. You got an order?	2	5
No, but we're going to make a pilot.	2	5
I remember that because Jimmy said,	2	5
"""Ask her. She's made every pilot in town."""	2	5
Come celebrate with me.	2	5
I'm at Sardi's, surrounded by clowns.	2	5
And why would I come?	2	5
I'm being ignored. Come take up my time.	2	5
I'm working.	2	5
You provided key advice.	2	5
We can call it business.	2	5
No. Let's not confuse this.	2	5
I'm about to change my mind.	2	5
Thank you.	2	5
Was there even a party?	2	5
He'll have an old fashioned.	2	5
Buddy Hackett told Jimmy	2	5
that Gleason didn't have to make a pilot,	2	5
so Jimmy went home to sulk,	2	5
and the rest went out to celebrate that they ruined his day.	2	5
So here we are.	2	5
I expect him to get this way when it's bad,	2	5
but when it's good?	2	5
Maybe he doesn't understand how big this is.	2	5
No, he does.	2	5
It's the big opportunity he's bound to ruin.	2	5
Mr. Draper.	2	5
Miss Menken.	2	5
Actually, it's Mrs. Katz.	2	5
- This is my husband Tilden. - Pleasure.	2	5
Mr. Draper's firm did some work for us a while back.	2	5
Advertising.	2	5
I'm Bobbie Barrett.	2	5
I'm sorry.	2	5
Mrs. Barrett's husband is a comedian who works with me.	2	5
Nice to meet you.	2	5
Tilden. I love comedians.	2	5
So, how are things at Grey?	2	5
Are they still taking credit for everything we did?	2	5
He's all business, isn't he?	2	5
Now, Rach, we don't want to miss the curtain.	2	5
We have seats for A Funny Thing Happened.	2	5
Oh, it's wonderful.	2	5
Well, you two enjoy working together.	2	5
Nice to meet you.	2	5
So, I would like some really good chow.	2	5
Shall we go elsewhere?	2	5
We can.	2	5
Does feel a little cloudy in here right now.	2	5
No, it's fine.	2	5
So, tell me what I want.	2	5
Steak tartare.	2	5
Oh, my God, you're good.	2	5
Hearts of palm salad. Steak tartare.	2	5
I always order for Jimmy.	2	5
Watch the money.	2	5
Otherwise he ends up sporting for people we don't know.	2	5
He doesn't realize that being a big shot means you don't have to pay.	2	5
I think you're wrong about that.	2	5
In the end, we're in different businesses, okay?	2	5
To a nice price on the pilot.	2	5
And I boxed them in for 39 on the air if they order.	2	5
You should have seen my neckline.	2	5
You really do his business, don't you?	2	5
If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't be Grin and Barrett.	2	5
It'd be Grin and Brownstein.	2	5
This is America.	2	5
Pick a job and then become the person that does it.	2	5
Well, that's true.	2	5
Right after I met Jimmy,	2	5
I watched somebody's Uncle Morty	2	5
close a deal for him,	2	5
and I realized I negotiate for everything...	2	5
the rent, the plumber, my hairdresser.	2	5
I even did it in a department store once.	2	5
It's touchy because you're really telling somebody	2	5
they're not worth what they think.	2	5
But you can't hurt their feelings.	2	5
Negotiating is a bore.	2	5
It's hand-to-hand combat.	2	5
You don't like negotiating.	2	5
What the hell do you like?	2	5
What do you mean?	2	5
Doesn't have to be in business.	2	5
I'll take anything.	2	5
You can't even answer.	2	5
The answer is huge.	2	5
I don't think so.	2	5
Do you like the ocean?	2	5
Yes.	2	5
Yes, I do.	2	5
I have a little place in Stony Brook, right on the shore.	2	5
I want to have you on the beach.	2	5
Feel the cold sand on my back with the surf pounding behind us.	2	5
I can smell the ocean.	2	5
I love bridges.	2	5
I don't know if it's the drop	2	5
or just because you get to see something	2	5
disappearing behind you.	2	5
Do you like bridges?	2	5
I do.	2	5
That's two things you like.	2	5
What else?	2	5
Movies.	2	5
Yes. Spartacus?	2	5
You seen the foreign ones?	2	5
So sexy.	2	5
Yes.	2	5
Why is it so hard to just enjoy things?	2	5
God, I feel so good.	2	5
I don't feel a thing.	2	5
You all right?	2	5
Yeah.	2	5
I think so.	2	5
Are you okay in there?	2	5
Mr. Draper, your wife says that the whiskey was hers.	2	5
But you did fail the sobriety test.	2	5
You're at the legal limit...	2	5
. 15 percent.	2	5
The fine's $150.	2	5
May I?	2	5
I have $63 and some subway tokens.	2	5
I'll mail you the rest.	2	5
I need you to pay the fine tonight.	2	5
Or I can put you up.	2	5
Let me call a cab, and I'll send an employee	2	5
out here with the $500 tomorrow morning.	2	5
I bet you would, too.	2	5
No, it's just 150.	2	5
It's within my rights to detain you.	2	5
What is the problem?	2	5
People's kids are out on that road, sir.	2	5
Call somebody.	2	5
Or maybe your wife has a friend.	2	5
I have $110.	2	5
It's all I could get short notice.	2	5
If you're going to be sick, please tell me.	2	5
This is my brother-in-law's car.	2	5
I put $2.00 worth of gas in it.	2	5
I don't want to have to clean it, too.	2	5
Mr. Draper, I think you should keep her awake.	2	5
Bobbie, stay up!	2	5
What?	2	5
What do you think?	2	5
Are you feeling okay?	2	5
You can drop me off at Grand Central.	2	5
Bobbie, what do you want to do?	2	5
Jimmy can't see me this way.	2	5
I should check in somewhere,	2	5
see how the shiner does.	2	5
Peggy, do you have a roommate?	2	5
No.	2	5
I don't know.	2	5
No, you should stay with me.	2	5
Just for the night, if you want.	2	5
Mr. Draper, you need to rent a car.	2	5
I can take you to LaGuardia.	2	5
Idlewild is better.	2	5
The Cross Island or the Belt Parkway.	2	5
It's faster to take the Grand Central to LaGuardia.	2	5
I don't have any clothes.	2	5
I wish I was your size.	2	5
Do you have any dry cleaning?	2	5
I'll pick it up.	2	5
In the city.	2	5
I'll go in and get it first thing.	2	5
Okay?	2	5
Hello.	2	5
Leave her alone.	2	5
No one in the office can know about this.	2	5
It's business.	2	5
You'll have to believe me that I'll forget this.	2	5
I don't want you treating me badly because I remind you of it.	2	5
This can be fixed.	2	5
Where the hell were you?	2	5
I was in an accident.	2	5
What? Are you okay?	2	5
What happened?	2	5
By the time I could call, I didn't want to wake you.	2	5
Wake...	2	5
Wake me?	2	5
I've been awake all night.	2	5
I knew something was wrong.	2	5
I could feel it.	2	5
I went to the doctor a while ago, and I have high blood pressure.	2	5
What the hell, Don?	2	5
It's fine, except...	2	5
he gave me a prescription,	2	5
and I think the pills mixed with the drinks was too much.	2	5
I lost control of the car.	2	5
Jesus. How could you not tell me about this?	2	5
I didn't want to worry you.	2	5
I've been up all night.	2	5
And now I find out you're sick and you could have died?	2	5
What did you want me to do?	2	5
Have you come down there?	2	5
Ask Francine in the middle of the night to watch the kids	2	5
because your husband's in the drunk tank?	2	5
Who cares if I couldn't help you?	2	5
You should call me.	2	5
I'm your wife.	2	5
I was solving a problem, Bets.	2	5
I need a clear head.	2	5
You can't get all hysterical.	2	5
I didn't know you were waiting up.	2	5
You promised you wouldn't disappear like that anymore.	2	5
I have to get changed and go in.	2	5
You're going to the office?	2	5
I don't want anyone to know about this.	2	5
I rented a car. I'll have to get my car.	2	5
I don't care about the car, Don.	2	5
My father has high blood pressure.	2	5
I'll swing by Dr. McLattery on the way in.	2	5
Just help me get dressed, okay?	2	5
You can fend without me.	2	5
I'm at a fat farm.	2	5
One of your friends made a crack about my ass.	2	5
It doesn't matter who.	2	5
Well, we're gonna be all over the television,	2	5
and the camera adds 10 pounds.	2	5
No. You look fine.	2	5
Jimmy, stop.	2	5
You and I both know	2	5
you should have behaved yourself last night.	2	5
I will.	2	5
I couldn't find an ashtray.	2	5
What's all this?	2	5
I thought you might be hungry.	2	5
It'll ruin my alibi.	2	5
I need cottage cheese and champagne.	2	5
I'm joking.	2	5
Do you mind if I lay down for a few minutes?	2	5
I'm not used to being up all night.	2	5
Of course, dear.	2	5
And I got this to keep me company.	2	5
I'll make up the couch for you.	2	5
You must be beat, too.	2	5
I'll make it.	2	5
- Where are the linens? - Just a minute.	2	5
Oh, Marilyn.	2	5
The tragedy you live.	2	5
I'm sure glad I don't have problems.	2	5
I think most women would love to have her problems.	2	5
Somebody said she's gonna be at the fundraiser	2	5
at the Garden on Saturday night.	2	5
You know, the president's birthday?	2	5
I really don't want to miss it.	2	5
Do you have a headache?	2	5
Because we had a little boy in our neighborhood	2	5
who fell off a swing set and hit his head	2	5
and went to sleep.	2	5
And then he died.	2	5
Well, it's certainly good to have company.	2	5
I'm sorry. I shouldn't talk that way.	2	5
I keep forgetting the accident.	2	5
It was terrible.	2	5
And it keeps getting stranger.	2	5
If you're lucky, it will disappear.	2	5
I have to lie down.	2	5
Are you his secretary?	2	5
No, but we work together.	2	5
We'll both be handling Mr. Draper for the time being.	2	5
Now, you're a college girl,	2	5
so I'm going to expect you to jump in with haste.	2	5
I have a lot of arrangements to make for my wedding.	2	5
Oh, my goodness. Congratulations.	2	5
He's a doctor. He doesn't work here,	2	5
so don't worry about putting your foot in your mouth.	2	5
Lucky you.	2	5
Let me see?	2	5
It's so lively.	2	5
You'd like to think it doesn't matter.	2	5
I've been offered a few, and this is by far the best.	2	5
I'm a little bit clairvoyant,	2	5
and I think you two are going to be very happy together.	2	5
I feel like I'm walking in tall cotton.	2	5
Aren't you darling? You're gonna be gangbusters.	2	5
Mr. Draper is impatient. Do not let it intimidate you.	2	5
If it isn't the welcome wagon.	2	5
Hello there.	2	5
I'm Ken Cosgrove, Accounts.	2	5
Paul Kinsey, copywriter.	2	5
Harry Crane, married.	2	5
Jane Siegel.	2	5
Anything I can help you gentlemen with?	2	5
I actually need to see Mr. Draper.	2	5
Is he in?	2	5
- Morning, Don. - Morning.	2	5
Mr. Draper.	2	5
I'd like you to meet Jane, the new girl.	2	5
Morning.	2	5
Can I talk to you for a minute?	2	5
I'm gonna help you hold onto this one.	2	5
I'm not paying attention anymore until they're here a month.	2	5
What happened to your wing?	2	5
I missed the bottom step.	2	5
It's an old house.	2	5
I got an urgent call from Jimmy Barrett.	2	5
He wants to come in.	2	5
Why?	2	5
He wouldn't say.	2	5
Was he upset about something?	2	5
Who can tell?	2	5
I want you to put him off a few days,	2	5
let him cool.	2	5
He'll make more sense.	2	5
Good idea. He probably wants a rubdown.	2	5
Paper says they ordered his pilot.	2	5
Friday.	2	5
Should I talk to your girl?	2	5
I'll handle it.	2	5
You bet.	2	5
Get the door.	2	5
Hello?	2	5
Is everything okay?	2	5
Yes, I think so.	2	5
Is she awake?	2	5
She's fine.	2	5
Put her on.	2	5
Just a minute.	2	5
I didn't think you'd call.	2	5
Why not?	2	5
I don't know. I just...	2	5
How are you?	2	5
I don't know.	2	5
Jimmy called. He wants to meet with me.	2	5
He does?	2	5
I called him, and everything went fine.	2	5
So you don't know anything about this?	2	5
You think I'd be in Brooklyn if I didn't have to be?	2	5
I talked to him. I'm covered. Believe me.	2	5
I do.	2	5
Are you okay?	2	5
I guess.	2	5
You?	2	5
It's going to be better.	2	5
Good.	2	5
Take care.	2	5
Do you want to play cards or something?	2	5
I think I have some.	2	5
No.	2	5
I'm sorry, but it's killing me.	2	5
Why are you doing this?	2	5
I don't know.	2	5
He's my boss.	2	5
Quite an example he's setting.	2	5
Are you seeing him?	2	5
No.	2	5
So what, then?	2	5
He's done a lot for me.	2	5
He made me a copywriter.	2	5
I bet you made yourself a copywriter.	2	5
All these books.	2	5
He's a decent man, isn't he?	2	5
You wouldn't think he would be.	2	5
I never expect him to be any other way than what he is.	2	5
We'll keep her here for another few weeks.	2	5
She's still not in any condition to make decisions for herself.	2	5
She should be at home.	2	5
Listen to the doctor, Mama.	2	5
In this kind of psychoneurotic disorder...	2	5
Hello, Ma.	2	5
Hello, dear.	2	5
I'm afraid you'll have to leave us alone.	2	5
I'm going, but I'm not leaving, Peaches.	2	5
Hello, Peggy.	2	5
How are you today?	2	5
I still feel so tired.	2	5
Do you know what year it is?	2	5
It's 1960.	2	5
Do you know who the president is?	2	5
Dwight D. Eisenhower.	2	5
Good. Do you know where you are, Peggy?	2	5
St. Mary's.	2	5
Do you know why you're here?	2	5
No.	2	5
You know St. Mary's is a hospital?	2	5
Yes.	2	5
Why do you think you're here?	2	5
I don't know.	2	5
I don't feel like myself.	2	5
That's because we have you on medication.	2	5
We want you to be relaxed so you feel more like talking.	2	5
I told you what happened.	2	5
You had a baby.	2	5
You know, you can hear that outside.	2	5
Nobody knows what I'm doing.	2	5
It's good for mystique.	2	5
So, Joanie, I hear congratulations are in order.	2	5
Yes.	2	5
Marriage. Don't know why you'd want to join that club, baby.	2	5
Hasn't stopped you from having a good time.	2	5
How old is this guy?	2	5
He's 34.	2	5
What's wrong with him?	2	5
Nothing.	2	5
Well, I think it's nice to hear the story of relatively young love.	2	5
Are you being a concerned daddy?	2	5
I'll tell you the same thing I told my daughter.	2	5
If you put a penny in a jar	2	5
every time you make love in the first year of marriage,	2	5
and then you take a penny out of the jar	2	5
every time you make love in the second year,	2	5
you know what you have?	2	5
A jar full of pennies.	2	5
I envy that girl having you to give her away.	2	5
I've always been faithful to whomever I was with.	2	5
And despite your jokes,	2	5
I always assumed you were unhappy with Mona,	2	5
not the whole idea.	2	5
You aren't just another woman, Joanie.	2	5
Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?	2	5
I fell in love.	2	5
Makes me sad.	2	5
Just another reason not to come in to work.	2	5
I'm not going anywhere.	2	5
Yes, you are.	2	5
You'll see.	2	5
Can I give you a couple paddles for good luck?	2	5
Coffee.	2	5
Thanks for buying milk.	2	5
I live alone. It always goes bad.	2	5
So this really must be a kick in the head.	2	5
Company is nice.	2	5
Your eye's improved.	2	5
That's good.	2	5
I can cover the purple with some green eye shadow.	2	5
Complementary colors. We use that.	2	5
Old trick.	2	5
I was a dancer.	2	5
I met a lot of interesting people.	2	5
You have a boyfriend?	2	5
No, I don't.	2	5
So, are you in love with him?	2	5
No.	2	5
It's not a ridiculous question.	2	5
Are you?	2	5
It's a personal question,	2	5
and I've already answered you.	2	5
You're right.	2	5
Aren't you going to ask me if I'm in love with him?	2	5
It's none of my business.	2	5
You're right again.	2	5
You're so young and beautiful.	2	5
I'm not your competition.	2	5
That's sweet.	2	5
Is there anything else I can get you?	2	5
No.	2	5
I love your place.	2	5
I've been trying to fix it up.	2	5
Well, I like it. It takes me back.	2	5
Unless one of you needs help finding a dead client file,	2	5
I suggest you pitch your tents elsewhere.	2	5
I see what you're doing,	2	5
and I have to say I'm disappointed.	2	5
I don't follow.	2	5
Your d?colletage is distracting.	2	5
This is an office that hinges on professional decorum.	2	5
I'm so sorry, Joan.	2	5
I didn't realize.	2	5
Better?	2	5
Go out and get a sweater at lunch.	2	5
Be reasonable.	2	5
There's still plenty to see, and you know that.	2	5
Jane.	2	5
I have some very important talent coming in tomorrow to see Don,	2	5
somebody famous,	2	5
and I just want to make sure you're aware of that.	2	5
What's your title here?	2	5
Title?	2	5
I'm Ken.	2	5
Cosgrove.	2	5
Accounts.	2	5
Yes, you're here in the book with Jimmy Barrett.	2	5
Would you like to go see him sometime?	2	5
Hey. Listen to this.	2	5
It's Mozart.	2	5
You can use the mirror in the bedroom.	2	5
No.	2	5
Part of the process of learning to live without your hospitality.	2	5
It's nothing.	2	5
Not true.	2	5
I was curious if you're aware of the value of your service.	2	5
It's what you're supposed to do, isn't it?	2	5
I wouldn't say that.	2	5
People will take advantage of you.	2	5
I know what I'm doing.	2	5
What do you want?	2	5
Are you just some busy little bee building a hive out in Brooklyn?	2	5
Are you still trying to say thank you?	2	5
You have to start living the life of the person you want to be.	2	5
Is that what you did?	2	5
You're never going to get that corner office	2	5
until you start treating Don as an equal.	2	5
And no one will tell you this,	2	5
but you can't be a man.	2	5
Don't even try.	2	5
Be a woman.	2	5
It's a powerful business when done correctly.	2	5
Do you understand what I'm saying, dear?	2	5
I think so.	2	5
How do I get to Grand Central from here, steam ship?	2	5
I can walk you to the train.	2	5
It's two blocks over.	2	5
I'll call a car.	2	5
Hello?	2	5
How was your day?	2	5
Spectacular.	2	5
Duck called Bert Peterson a mongoloid.	2	5
What a leader of men.	2	5
Dr. Stone's office rang.	2	5
How is Dr. Stone?	2	5
I didn't ask, but the nurse said that your sample was quite viable.	2	5
Is that right?	2	5
Well. What do you know?	2	5
That is a relief, I do say.	2	5
Yes.	2	5
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, are they?	2	5
I suppose.	2	5
To viability.	2	5
What? This is good.	2	5
It is.	2	5
This is what you wanted, isn't it?	2	5
No, you're right. It's a relief.	2	5
Now we know it's me.	2	5
Right.	2	5
So Stone can blow up your ovaries or do whatever his cutting-edge plan is.	2	5
Peter, I can't believe you.	2	5
Wait a minute. You wanted to do this.	2	5
You had to know this was a possible outcome.	2	5
Get back here!	2	5
Trudy!	2	5
Sit down.	2	5
I'm sorry.	2	5
I didn't think it through.	2	5
That's honest.	2	5
I don't know what I thought.	2	5
Who says we have to do this?	2	5
Except for what,	2	5
it's the next thing we're supposed to do?	2	5
But it is. It's natural.	2	5
Says who?	2	5
I was having a great time.	2	5
Weren't you?	2	5
Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be.	2	5
I mean, you have a baby.	2	5
You can't travel.	2	5
You can't go to the movies unless you have help,	2	5
and that's expensive.	2	5
You're immature, Peter, you know that?	2	5
I just did a very private thing	2	5
in a very public place for you.	2	5
And guess what. You don't like the results.	2	5
What do you want me to do?	2	5
Express some concern.	2	5
And stop talking about how you're going to miss	2	5
seeing Cape Fear for the third time.	2	5
I know one thing.	2	5
I sure as hell wouldn't want a kid here watching this donnybrook.	2	5
Either you make it through this thing,	2	5
or you just keep it to yourself.	2	5
I'm giving you that option.	2	5
Stop!	2	5
I'm sorry.	2	5
I'm just...	2	5
It's just I really do want a baby.	2	5
What is all this for?	2	5
I don't know.	2	5
Can we eat now?	2	5
Not here.	2	5
Get your coat.	2	5
Is that you?	2	5
Are you really there?	2	5
Yes, I am.	2	5
What are you doing here?	2	5
You got a promotion and disappeared.	2	5
Your Christmas present is sitting on your desk.	2	5
I called your house,	2	5
and your roommate gave me your mother's number.	2	5
Oh, God.	2	5
Your mother told me you were quarantined.	2	5
TB.	2	5
I guess that was supposed to lessen my concern.	2	5
I'm sorry.	2	5
What's wrong with you?	2	5
I don't know.	2	5
What do they want you to do?	2	5
I don't know.	2	5
Yes, you do.	2	5
Do it.	2	5
Do whatever they say.	2	5
Peggy, listen to me.	2	5
Get out of here and move forward.	2	5
This never happened.	2	5
It will shock you how much it never happened.	2	5
It's old work, and we're meeting early next week.	2	5
The artwork is new.	2	5
I'm going to see my father-in-law this weekend,	2	5
and he's going to ask me.	2	5
Mr. Draper, Jimmy Barrett is going to be early.	2	5
I'm sorry I'm late.	2	5
Don was asking where we're going with this.	2	5
I need more time. I was sick.	2	5
I did my work.	2	5
Should we bring someone else in?	2	5
Throw it at Kurt and Smitty?	2	5
I don't know. Miss Olson, do you need some help?	2	5
No. I'll have it first thing Monday.	2	5
Yes, you will.	2	5
Yes?	2	5
Mr. Draper, I'm sorry I was unprepared.	2	5
Don't let it happen again.	2	5
Well, it's... it's just that...	2	5
What?	2	5
$110 is a lot of money for me.	2	5
Your bail.	2	5
Right.	2	5
Here.	2	5
I'll give you 50 tomorrow.	2	5
I guess when you try to forget something,	2	5
you have to forget everything.	2	5
Thank you, Don.	2	5
Wow, Draper.	2	5
Some kind of tomato farm you got here.	2	5
Window dressing's important.	2	5
Can I get you anything?	2	5
I was going to ask you the same thing.	2	5
Blondie, wait outside.	2	5
Jimmy, Mrs. Barrett, you look good.	2	5
You don't. What happened to the flipper there?	2	5
Old football injury.	2	5
Yeah. I get those, too.	2	5
Have a seat.	2	5
No need. I'll keep this short.	2	5
I just want to thank you for convincing the folks at Utz	2	5
to let me do the show.	2	5
- My pleasure. - Yeah.	2	5
We all got what we wanted, didn't we?	2	5
What I'm trying to say is, the way I behaved,	2	5
I wouldn't have been surprised if you would have, you know,	2	5
looked the other way on this thing, blocked it up.	2	5
Why would I do that?	2	5
This guy.	2	5
I can't tell if he's being smug or not.	2	5
I just wanted you to know that I'm not a bad guy.	2	5
You didn't have to come all the way in here to say that.	2	5
I know that.	2	5
Nobody knows that.	2	5
You're a cool cat, Donnie.	2	5
Okay.	2	5
Bye, Mr. Draper.	2	5
- Daddy! - Daddy!	2	5
How was your day?	2	5
I made it.	2	5
Where's the salt?	2	5
Oh, Bets. No salt?	2	5
You'll see. You'll get used to it.	2	5
It's for your own good.	2	5
What would we do without you?	2	5
Why can't Daddy have salt?	2	5
Because we love him.	2	5
Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA	2	5
You're asking if I've seen these before?	2	6
They've been running this for ten years.	2	6
The Playtex people are jealous.	2	6
They shouldn't be.	2	6
Maidenform is a dream, but Playtex is a bra.	2	6
I've never seen either brand go wrong.	2	6
I had four of these up in my dorm.	2	6
I didn't even know what advertising was.	2	6
Why now? Sales are strong.	2	6
Someone has a wife with an opinion.	2	6
They would like to do what Maidenform is doing,	2	6
not what we're doing.	2	6
Why? Then they both have the same campaign.	2	6
I love how they don't need a diagram.	2	6
Peggy, do you wear Playtex?	2	6
And if so, why?	2	6
I do,	2	6
and I agree with the 95 women we surveyed	2	6
about how well it fits.	2	6
I find they both open easily.	2	6
I like a happy client,	2	6
although you'd think someone would be able	2	6
to talk them out of jumping onto a bandwagon	2	6
- as solid as this. - Maybe they want us to raise the bar.	2	6
Why, because their share of the market keeps increasing?	2	6
You see them every four months.	2	6
Why not throw them a bone?	2	6
Let them see they're paying for creative.	2	6
Just wrinkle it a little.	2	6
I went to sleep in my bra,	2	6
and I thought I was so-and-so.	2	6
Thank you for that.	2	6
Just for fun, let's say we're looking for new,	2	6
and by new I mean old Maidenform.	2	6
Peggy, you dig in around Playtex's unique benefits.	2	6
Just the man to do it.	2	6
What do I tell them?	2	6
Tell them you couldn't get a hold of me.	2	6
Mr. Phillips, your ex...	2	6
your wife...	2	6
Mrs. Phillips...	2	6
Pauline. I see her.	2	6
Thank you, Joyce.	2	6
Hey, fella.	2	6
Hey, Chauncey. Come here.	2	6
Someone made you smell like a girl, yes.	2	6
Come on. This way.	2	6
Hey, slugger.	2	6
Hey, Dad.	2	6
- Precious. - Hi, Daddy.	2	6
- You look well. - So do you.	2	6
How's your mother?	2	6
Worse. She's very erratic.	2	6
Did you see the guy up at Brigham	2	6
that Bob Levinson recommended?	2	6
I don't want to talk about this right now.	2	6
I can't leave right now.	2	6
I wish you would have told me	2	6
that you were going to be early.	2	6
Well, I know you're not good in the afternoons.	2	6
That's not true anymore. You know that.	2	6
Okay.	2	6
You two have a good time.	2	6
I will try and call you from Nana's.	2	6
Did you get a suite?	2	6
They opened up the room next door.	2	6
I even got a rollaway for Chauncey.	2	6
'Cause he's a good boy. Yeah.	2	6
We're going to have a wonderful time on the town.	2	6
I got tickets for A Funny Thing Happened.	2	6
We saw it.	2	6
Not from these seats.	2	6
I should go.	2	6
So, you'll have to wait a little while in my office,	2	6
do your studies, work up an appetite.	2	6
It's Memorial Day.	2	6
All I have is German vocabulary.	2	6
Hey, Duck. Sorry to bother you.	2	6
Nice dog.	2	6
Who are these?	2	6
This is my son Mark and my daughter Patricia.	2	6
A handsome family.	2	6
And this is Chauncey.	2	6
I hope he can't smell cat on me.	2	6
Freddie and I work together.	2	6
Can I bend your ear a minute?	2	6
Spit it out, Freddie.	2	6
We're going to need another box of brassieres.	2	6
Yes. Of course.	2	6
Enjoy your holiday.	2	6
Come on, Chauncey.	2	6
Her skin cleared up, but she still looks unhappy.	2	6
She's a cheerleader.	2	6
For who, the University of Dour?	2	6
Does she have any cute friends?	2	6
These are the top three.	2	6
I'm sorry, but compared to the kids on American Bandstand,	2	6
they look miserable.	2	6
Those kids are drunk.	2	6
Really?	2	6
I don't know.	2	6
What about the idea of them going on a date?	2	6
Mr. And Mrs. Fresh Face.	2	6
We could do multiple panels in print,	2	6
but it would really translate to TV.	2	6
How?	2	6
Like a contest?	2	6
No, it's a story.	2	6
Anticipation as they get ready,	2	6
fixing their hair to look perfect.	2	6
Their skin, it's not even on their mind.	2	6
They're two kids who used to have a problem.	2	6
Thanks, Clearasil.	2	6
Maybe, but it's prom night,	2	6
and it ends with him at the door and her and a corsage,	2	6
the first moment they see each other.	2	6
And Dad with the Brownie?	2	6
Clearasil...	2	6
and some kind of line.	2	6
"What about ""Thanks, Clearasil""?"	2	6
I need to think about it.	2	6
I can work with that.	2	6
You want to run this by your father-in-law?	2	6
Eventually.	2	6
Have a nice holiday.	2	6
So how the hell are you, Don?	2	6
Good. How are you, Crab?	2	6
Glad to be in shorts.	2	6
You don't play?	2	6
I don't mind watching.	2	6
Whenever it's this hot,	2	6
I think about that summer they executed the Rosenbergs.	2	6
It was always about to rain.	2	6
I remember that.	2	6
We were still in Manhattan.	2	6
- I don't miss it. - Yep.	2	6
We get them to close Sing Sing, we'll be in Shangri-la.	2	6
I keep having this dream	2	6
that there's a power failure and the gates open.	2	6
Hadn't thought of that.	2	6
Let's change the subject.	2	6
"Eventually, I just said, ""Fine."	2	6
"""If Lem Jones Associates is falling apart, maybe it's time to move on."""	2	6
I hadn't heard about that.	2	6
I guess you PR men have the best PR.	2	6
Yeah, I went to Rogers & Cowan and left it burning behind me.	2	6
What happened over there?	2	6
I was on the team that took the fall for the Cuban Revolutionary Council.	2	6
The Bay of Pigs?	2	6
The CIA hired us to help inspire the Cuban people	2	6
to a coordinated wave of sabotage and rebellion.	2	6
You handled that?	2	6
Not as badly as they did.	2	6
But I don't know when Don's going to be able to get away.	2	6
High-class problems, my dear.	2	6
Marcie, we should say hello to Chuck and Ann.	2	6
I didn't know you belonged here.	2	6
I've been coming here since I was a kid.	2	6
We're guests of the Pattersons.	2	6
Where's Tara?	2	6
Over there, I think.	2	6
I haven't seen you riding.	2	6
I suppose that's true.	2	6
I know you changed your schedule,	2	6
and I'm afraid I had something to do with that.	2	6
No. Don't be ridiculous.	2	6
All I wanted to say is please ride when you want.	2	6
I'll stay out of your way.	2	6
It's very nice to see you.	2	6
Arthur, it's okay.	2	6
As we used to say in college, let's be friends.	2	6
Good. Because I think you would have enjoyed	2	6
seeing me get nosed into the trough the other day.	2	6
No.	2	6
Yes.	2	6
Mommy! Mommy!	2	6
Well, it's nice to see you.	2	6
You as well.	2	6
It had nothing to do with Kennedy.	2	6
Still, all that vigor disappeared	2	6
when he found out he couldn't get anything done.	2	6
It's Versailles.	2	6
Jackie's smiling all over the world.	2	6
He's chasing starlets.	2	6
Everybody's happy.	2	6
I'm building a bomb shelter.	2	6
Really?	2	6
If you see Petra, don't mention it.	2	6
She doesn't want people to know.	2	6
Good seeing you, Don.	2	6
Let me know if you need a reference.	2	6
We'd love to have you here.	2	6
If I could have everyone's attention for a moment.	2	6
Please be seated.	2	6
It is a tradition	2	6
that we have our ribs and fashion show on this day every year.	2	6
Well, this is not to dim our resolute admiration	2	6
for the fortitude of those who have so nobly served our country,	2	6
many of whom will not be enjoying ribs this afternoon.	2	6
If you could please stand, all servicemen,	2	6
for a moment of our insufficient appreciation.	2	6
Including Lester Aaron.	2	6
Lester was a Rough Rider.	2	6
Please, heroes, on your feet.	2	6
Can you close the door?	2	6
You're letting the air out.	2	6
Those look delicious.	2	6
It's not the club,	2	6
but at least you know I washed my hands.	2	6
How are things in the circus?	2	6
Damn serious.	2	6
What is this?	2	6
J&B.	2	6
The network sent me a case.	2	6
This is why I don't have a TV.	2	6
You want something else?	2	6
He'll suffer through it.	2	6
Do you know where you're summering?	2	6
We were thinking Point O'Woods.	2	6
I have to work, though.	2	6
Mother's going to expect you on Fishers.	2	6
I see her crossing the widow's walk with an eye to the sea.	2	6
Peter.	2	6
I was on the phone with her the other day,	2	6
and you were all she talked about.	2	6
- Really? - No. I'm kidding.	2	6
I don't think I know what's funny about that.	2	6
Judy, would you help me with the corn?	2	6
Now, listen. Don't scrimp.	2	6
Take a vacation.	2	6
Don't Trudy's folks have some incredible vacation spread?	2	6
It's not about the money, Bud.	2	6
I'm very important to the agency.	2	6
My absence is felt.	2	6
Yes. Well.	2	6
Let's see how the Ottomanelli Brothers treated us.	2	6
And here's Annette Fogel ready for the playa.	2	6
That's Spanish for beach, gentlemen,	2	6
and that's where you'll want to be.	2	6
If something sportier is what you're looking for,	2	6
- check out... - I have to go.	2	6
...last year's singles champion.	2	6
Really? You're really going?	2	6
I wouldn't think you'd want to leave this.	2	6
People will be working. I should stop by.	2	6
Okay.	2	6
You're going to miss the sparklers.	2	6
Call me from the emergency room.	2	6
Oh, and this delight, Judy Sawyer,	2	6
is ready for the beaches of California,	2	6
where she loves to do the Watusi.	2	6
Room 301.	2	6
Hello.	2	6
You're there. Good.	2	6
Yes.	2	6
But there's been a change of plans.	2	6
I'm spending the day with my son.	2	6
We're going to the beach.	2	6
Your son?	2	6
He's 18.	2	6
I don't know why I never brought him up.	2	6
Jimmy will be at the Beverly Hills for the next ten days.	2	6
Los Angeles. That's far away.	2	6
No. It's some club in Kentucky.	2	6
Still far away.	2	6
I could stay out at the beach, and you could join.	2	6
You never saw it.	2	6
Don't do that.	2	6
What? You never think about it?	2	6
No.	2	6
I do. All the time.	2	6
The car on its side, your body crushing me.	2	6
I don't know why I think about it.	2	6
Maybe I do.	2	6
I'll call you.	2	6
I'd like that.	2	6
Morning.	2	6
Hello.	2	6
"I ran that ""Thanks, Clearasil"" thing by my father-in-law."	2	6
He loved it.	2	6
I'm glad.	2	6
The libraries were closed yesterday.	2	6
What did you do?	2	6
I was working,	2	6
and then there was a barbecue.	2	6
It was too hot.	2	6
It was too hot.	2	6
Trudy and I saw Liberty Valance.	2	6
It goes along for a while,	2	6
and then it takes a turn	2	6
and ends up exactly where you thought it was going.	2	6
John Wayne shot him.	2	6
Have you seen it yet?	2	6
It's okay. You saved me 50 cents.	2	6
I'm sorry. I hate people who do that.	2	6
I know you don't like the line.	2	6
Look, it's all about keeping your father-in-law happy.	2	6
I do my job, you do yours.	2	6
What's that supposed to mean?	2	6
Nothing.	2	6
Just play with it.	2	6
Okay?	2	6
So you're still out there in Brooklyn?	2	6
Yes.	2	6
Where again?	2	6
Marine Park?	2	6
No, I moved a while ago.	2	6
I'm on my second apartment, in Prospect Park.	2	6
East 83rd Street.	2	6
It's a ghost town.	2	6
But my brother came to my cookout.	2	6
Who were you with?	2	6
My family.	2	6
Pete, look, I really do have a lot of work to do.	2	6
Of course.	2	6
Let me know where you land.	2	6
How was your day off?	2	6
Restful.	2	6
I went to the beach.	2	6
Too much, I see.	2	6
I got it behind my knees.	2	6
I couldn't sit down.	2	6
Morning.	2	6
Good morning, Mr. Sterling.	2	6
Has your wife seen that yet?	2	6
Do me a favor. Let me be there when it happens.	2	6
Is that why you're here?	2	6
Concerned for my well-being?	2	6
Here's your cigarette. Be on your way.	2	6
But wait. There's more.	2	6
You are going to have lunch with Duck.	2	6
Perhaps on a train car,	2	6
because I want you to sign an armistice on American Airlines.	2	6
What are you talking about?	2	6
I've been in the meetings.	2	6
Errol Flynn is gone, and so is my taste for swordplay.	2	6
You two need to put them away.	2	6
I have.	2	6
I've been married for over 20 years.	2	6
I know the difference between a spat and spending a month on the couch.	2	6
Don't go to bed angry.	2	6
Two hot chocolates.	2	6
I don't want it.	2	6
Sure you do.	2	6
It's good when it's hot to drink something hot.	2	6
If you continued with the Scouts, you would have learned that.	2	6
Patty, you can use the phone, but Miss Morrison works for me, not you.	2	6
Daddy has a morning meeting.	2	6
There's a food cart. It'll be here in 20 minutes.	2	6
No scraps for Chauncey.	2	6
I have money. I have $150.	2	6
Mark.	2	6
That's good.	2	6
How did you get that tidy sum?	2	6
Mr. Reeve gave it to me.	2	6
And why would he do that?	2	6
Because he wants us to be happy when he marries Mom.	2	6
We all want you to be happy.	2	6
And whatever his intentions, it's very generous.	2	6
He already asked her.	2	6
Well.	2	6
You must have known eventually	2	6
that your mother and I might be starting new lives.	2	6
We understand. We don't care.	2	6
It's not easy for her.	2	6
With you away at St. Paul's now, she's lost her man of the house.	2	6
Franklin Reeve is a good man.	2	6
Mom's going to stick you with Chauncey.	2	6
What?	2	6
We're supposed to say good-bye to him.	2	6
She can't make you do that.	2	6
Dad, he's your dog.	2	6
And I've learned to live without him	2	6
so you two kids could have some consistency.	2	6
Frank's allergic.	2	6
Your mother will be here in a half an hour.	2	6
Where are we?	2	6
We had an interesting idea.	2	6
We?	2	6
Are you on Playtex?	2	6
He wants to get credit for his idea.	2	6
You sure about that?	2	6
Well, we went out the other night, after the meeting...	2	6
you know, a little extra hours after hours...	2	6
and I looked around the bar.	2	6
We all did.	2	6
From what I understand,	2	6
Playtex has an amazing bra, but it doesn't take you anywhere.	2	6
Well put.	2	6
So I was thinking.	2	6
Women right now already have a fantasy,	2	6
and it's not going up the Nile.	2	6
It's right here in America.	2	6
Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.	2	6
Every single woman is one of them.	2	6
Watch this.	2	6
Jackie.	2	6
Marilyn.	2	6
Jackie.	2	6
Marilyn...	2	6
Well, Marilyn's really a Joan, not the other way around.	2	6
That is an idea and an impressive presentation.	2	6
Well, you always say it's a 24-hour-a-day job.	2	6
Apparently, I've already signed off on it.	2	6
I don't know if all women are a Jackie or a Marilyn.	2	6
Maybe men see them that way.	2	6
Bras are for men.	2	6
Women want to see themselves the way men see them.	2	6
You're a Jackie or a Marilyn...	2	6
a line and a curve.	2	6
Nothing goes better together.	2	6
Which do you think I am?	2	6
Gertrude Stein.	2	6
I would say you're more classical,	2	6
Hellenic.	2	6
Irene Dunne.	2	6
I love Irene Dunne.	2	6
Peggy, you're going to have company on this.	2	6
Congratulations, Kinsey.	2	6
You forced your way onto an account.	2	6
Mr. Phillips is here.	2	6
Sorry I'm late.	2	6
Get back. Out.	2	6
Who's the new account man?	2	6
It's Chauncey. Sorry about that.	2	6
Listen, any idea when I can schedule Playtex?	2	6
We're laying track.	2	6
I think you can bring the train in tomorrow.	2	6
Something new, I hope.	2	6
Can I drop some crumbs, at least?	2	6
Two sides of one woman...	2	6
Jackie by day, Marilyn by night.	2	6
Maybe it's two girls.	2	6
But definitely two flavors...	2	6
vanilla and cherry.	2	6
Sounds good.	2	6
Don, your girl says you're free for lunch.	2	6
She's in charge.	2	6
Come on, Chauncey.	2	6
Come on.	2	6
Thought you all were listening. Let's go.	2	6
Freddie.	2	6
What, sweetheart?	2	6
I wish you would have told me you were going to work Tuesday night.	2	6
If you have something better,	2	6
I'll run it by Don.	2	6
He already likes that.	2	6
Yes, he does.	2	6
Isn't that our goal?	2	6
I'm not saying I had a better idea,	2	6
but now I'm not even a part of it.	2	6
All I had to do was be in that bar.	2	6
Believe me, you didn't want to be in that bar.	2	6
The work's done.	2	6
Now go write me some titillating copy.	2	6
Mr. Draper is here to see you.	2	6
Send him in.	2	6
Are you coming by to pick me up?	2	6
No.	2	6
It's just I wasn't really planning on coming back after lunch.	2	6
Any way we can have this conversation now?	2	6
Conversation?	2	6
Roger told me it was just a friendly lunch.	2	6
I know.	2	6
People start giving you things.	2	6
They think it's cute.	2	6
I've got a crate of that crap somewhere.	2	6
That's quite a playing field you have there.	2	6
I don't like anything on it but ashes.	2	6
I thought maybe your secretary was better than mine.	2	6
Nobody's secretary's better than yours.	2	6
You creative directors.	2	6
All I can say is it's been hard to figure things out around here.	2	6
Eighteen months in?	2	6
We can't be that unusual.	2	6
I'm doing the job you hired me to do.	2	6
I tell people that Sterling Cooper is the only place to be.	2	6
You've been pitching more to me than you have to clients.	2	6
What does that mean?	2	6
It means you've been selling their ideas to me	2	6
more than mine to them.	2	6
When I was in the Marine Corps, I missed duty.	2	6
Fell down the steps or something.	2	6
My squad leader covered, but then I confessed to the men.	2	6
He laid down some rifle fire for me, and I acted like I didn't need it.	2	6
That's not the situation I want to be in here.	2	6
So what, you're covering for me?	2	6
Who am I in this story?	2	6
I'm grateful, Don.	2	6
If you hadn't brought me in, where would I be?	2	6
Some fifth wheel at McCann?	2	6
Look, I did everything I could for you on American Airlines.	2	6
It was a risk worth taking.	2	6
People think of us differently.	2	6
What do you want me to say?	2	6
That we're on the same team?	2	6
That I love being in your unit?	2	6
Sarge, I'm scared?	2	6
"You have an ""I told you so,"" okay?"	2	6
Can we move forward?	2	6
I'm the one that looks bad.	2	6
It hasn't hurt the company.	2	6
Yes.	2	6
Of course we can.	2	6
And I will tell Roger we had lunch.	2	6
Well. Good, then.	2	6
Okay.	2	6
Where did you come from?	2	6
You don't want to know.	2	6
Wait.	2	6
I love it.	2	6
I'm warm and I'm cold.	2	6
What time is it?	2	6
A little after 4.	2	6
I have to get ready.	2	6
Where are you going?	2	6
My daughter's in a play.	2	6
Daughter?	2	6
Is that everyone?	2	6
She's at Sarah Lawrence.	2	6
How much preparation do you need?	2	6
You don't want me to go.	2	6
I took the afternoon off.	2	6
For me?	2	6
You're a lion, aren't you?	2	6
Now I know what you like.	2	6
You can go.	2	6
I know I can.	2	6
Do you want to stay here?	2	6
Watch TV?	2	6
Go through my things?	2	6
I would never leave you alone in my place.	2	6
Yes, you would.	2	6
Stay.	2	6
Relax.	2	6
Believe me, I'm the same way.	2	6
It has to come out somewhere.	2	6
I'll get you out in time for dinner, I promise.	2	6
What's going on?	2	6
You here to audition?	2	6
No one told me about this.	2	6
I'm taking pictures. You can look at the pictures.	2	6
I didn't know you'd want to come.	2	6
Is Paul in there?	2	6
A lot of guys are in there.	2	6
You can come in if you want.	2	6
No. I'm just surprised because I have an eye for this.	2	6
Don't worry about Kinsey.	2	6
I won't let him put anything together without you.	2	6
Who's next?	2	6
Hey, girl.	2	6
You look lost.	2	6
Chauncey.	2	6
Here he is.	2	6
I apologize, Chauncey.	2	6
I thought you were a girl.	2	6
Beautiful dog.	2	6
Where have you been hiding him?	2	6
I made my wife give him back to me.	2	6
Missed him too much.	2	6
I like dogs.	2	6
Dogs are better than wives.	2	6
Never a problem communicating.	2	6
I like having one in the office.	2	6
Makes us look more easygoing,	2	6
friendly, you know, to clients.	2	6
Maybe I'll bring one in, too.	2	6
What breed do you have?	2	6
I don't have one.	2	6
I was going to get one for the office.	2	6
I don't think that's a good idea.	2	6
Good night, Campbell.	2	6
Come on, Chauncey.	2	6
What were you doing in Sterling Cooper?	2	6
There was a casting call for Playtex.	2	6
Right.	2	6
The fellas are calling it the bra-ditions.	2	6
That's funny.	2	6
You work there?	2	6
I do.	2	6
Want me to find out how it went?	2	6
I already know. Not well.	2	6
I find that hard to believe.	2	6
Well, they fall in love with a picture of you,	2	6
and then you come in, and they're disappointed.	2	6
But it doesn't make any sense because all they need is a picture.	2	6
I didn't bring my camera with me,	2	6
but I can't imagine it being better than this.	2	6
I don't know. Maybe I look tired.	2	6
I just flew back from working in London.	2	6
London?	2	6
What's your name?	2	6
Peter Campbell.	2	6
Oh, my. Account executive.	2	6
I love the taste of Scotch.	2	6
Thank you.	2	6
Stop. Turn around.	2	6
Let me look at you.	2	6
When I first saw you,	2	6
I thought you were foreign.	2	6
Really? Is that right?	2	6
Hold that.	2	6
I have company.	2	6
I'll be right back.	2	6
Who was that?	2	6
- My mother. - Really?	2	6
What, you didn't think I had a mother?	2	6
It's okay.	2	6
Hold on.	2	6
Up the long, delirious, burning blue,	2	6
I topped the windswept heights with easy grace	2	6
where never lark or even eagle flew.	2	6
And while with silent lifting mind	2	6
I strode the high untrespassed	2	6
sanctity of space,	2	6
put out my hand,	2	6
and touched the face of God.	2	6
You want me to fix you something?	2	6
What's that?	2	6
Cereal.	2	6
No. That.	2	6
Do you like it?	2	6
I bought it at the auction.	2	6
Can I speak to you a minute?	2	6
What? What's wrong?	2	6
Where are you going in that?	2	6
Swimming.	2	6
You asked me if I like it. I don't.	2	6
What are you talking about?	2	6
I'm talking about a 15-year-old lifeguard.	2	6
I'm talking about a bunch of tennis pros,	2	6
not to mention all those loafing millionaires taking the summer off.	2	6
- Do you want to be ogled? - Oh, Don.	2	6
Everybody bought one at the auction.	2	6
It's desperate.	2	6
I didn't know that.	2	6
I have to go.	2	6
See you tonight.	2	6
Joan, there you are.	2	6
Are you aware that I'm on the Playtex account?	2	6
What about it?	2	6
Please tell the girls I am to be included in all the memos.	2	6
Sure. For a moment there,	2	6
I thought you were just another person coming to ask me about my brassiere.	2	6
Why aren't I on the list?	2	6
I don't know what to tell you.	2	6
I'm not involved in that.	2	6
There's business going on, and I'm not invited.	2	6
I'm a good drinker.	2	6
What are you asking me?	2	6
You know how this office works.	2	6
Parts of it.	2	6
Forget it.	2	6
I've never had your job.	2	6
I've never wanted it.	2	6
You're in their country.	2	6
Learn to speak the language.	2	6
You don't talk that way.	2	6
I don't need to.	2	6
And honestly,	2	6
you've never listened to a word I've said.	2	6
You want to be taken seriously?	2	6
Stop dressing like a little girl.	2	6
Jacqueline Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe.	2	6
Women have feelings about these women	2	6
because men do.	2	6
Because we want both, they want to be both.	2	6
It's about how they want to be seen by us...	2	6
their husbands, their boyfriends,	2	6
their friends' husbands.	2	6
Here's the idea, very simply.	2	6
The bra is called the Harlequin.	2	6
In fit and form, it should be your very best.	2	6
It comes in black and white.	2	6
Jackie, Marilyn.	2	6
Same incredible fit,	2	6
two different women.	2	6
And the beauty of it is it's the same woman,	2	6
the same model.	2	6
Look at that. It is.	2	6
And even if you don't notice it,	2	6
"you still get a bit of an ""Aha"""	2	6
when you read the copy.	2	6
"""Nothing fits both sides of a woman"	2	6
"better than Playtex."""	2	6
It's a very impressive idea, Don.	2	6
I like the girl.	2	6
So will your customers.	2	6
It's a very flattering mirror.	2	6
This definitely moves you into Maidenform's neighborhood.	2	6
But sales have been so good	2	6
when we talk about how well our brassieres fit.	2	6
I don't know what to say.	2	6
We were talking in the cab on the way over.	2	6
Let Maidenform have women's imaginations.	2	6
We'll take their money.	2	6
I couldn't have said it better myself.	2	6
Well, I apologize for the goose chase.	2	6
We're very sorry.	2	6
No one else can have this campaign, right?	2	6
It's yours.	2	6
We'll keep it on file for you.	2	6
A pleasure.	2	6
- Thanks again. - Thanks for coming in.	2	6
That was a waste of inspiration.	2	6
These people.	2	6
Don't worry. It's not your fault.	2	6
They made up their minds on the way over.	2	6
Why put up a fight?	2	6
I think we bought a couple years of security.	2	6
If they ever decide they want to go that way,	2	6
they know we can do it.	2	6
Listen, we would love to show our appreciation	2	6
by entertaining you gentlemen tonight.	2	6
And you can put it on our bill.	2	6
Make sure Don knows he's invited.	2	6
Where should we go?	2	6
Surprise us.	2	6
If we were to take you to see some girls in their underwear,	2	6
would you feel like you're at work?	2	6
No. That sounds good.	2	6
Well, let us clear the decks.	2	6
6:30 at the Tom-Tom.	2	6
That's on 44th and 8th.	2	6
We will be there, and the tab will be open.	2	6
I'm going to go tell Campbell.	2	6
Take care.	2	6
Good to see you.	2	6
- See you there. - Bye-bye.	2	6
Mr. Phillips.	2	6
We have artwork in the evening papers, son,	2	6
and I don't have them.	2	6
Someone's supposed to put them on my desk,	2	6
Friday or not.	2	6
Should I get some?	2	6
What do you think?	2	6
I'll be right back.	2	6
It's flattering to be able to keep you interested.	2	6
Stop talking.	2	6
Why don't you want me to talk?	2	6
You know you want me to.	2	6
Do I?	2	6
You do.	2	6
Touch me.	2	6
No.	2	6
Don't stop torturing me.	2	6
I want the full Don Draper treatment.	2	6
You're spoiling the mood.	2	6
I wanted it, and I got it,	2	6
and it's better than they said.	2	6
What?	2	6
Have no fear.	2	6
You're known as a connoisseur.	2	6
You have lots of fans.	2	6
Are you talking about me?	2	6
I wasn't, no.	2	6
Well, who was?	2	6
What?	2	6
Who?	2	6
Sarah Tierney at Random House.	2	6
I don't know who you're talking about.	2	6
Stop.	2	6
This is nobody's maiden voyage here,	2	6
handsome.	2	6
You have a reputation.	2	6
Enjoy it.	2	6
Does it make you feel better to think that I'm like you?	2	6
My goodness.	2	6
Gloves come off.	2	6
I like this.	2	6
You want to blindfold me?	2	6
What are you doing?	2	6
Are you going?	2	6
I told you to stop talking.	2	6
Thank you.	2	6
People are going to think you're the mayor.	2	6
Hey, look, it's Peggy.	2	6
What are you doing here?	2	6
I don't know. I heard we were celebrating.	2	6
I thought I'd stop by.	2	6
Did you now?	2	6
- Stay for one drink. - Okay.	2	6
You're staying all night, honey.	2	6
Now you got the best seat in the house.	2	6
Tell me what you want for Christmas.	2	6
Yeah!	2	6
What do you want for breakfast?	2	6
Grapefruit.	2	6
Hey, Daddy.	2	6
Hey, you.	2	6
I'm not going to talk.	2	6
I don't want you to cut yourself.	2	6
Are you okay, Daddy?	2	6
You know what, Sally?	2	6
I think you better leave me alone. 	2	6
Afraid you'Il fall in love?	2	7
Something like that.	2	7
WelI, I can see you have good taste.	2	7
This is the one.	2	7
1 962 Coupe de Ville.	2	7
Does everything but make breakfast.	2	7
What are you in now?	2	7
I had a Dodge.	2	7
Those are wonderful if you want to get somewhere.	2	7
This is for when you've already arrived.	2	7
Is that right?	2	7
 Of course, someone like you,	2	7
you don't need to see yourself in a Cadillac.	2	7
You're walking about in one every day.	2	7
How'd you like your car to look like that?	2	7
Look at you.	2	7
I bet you'd be as comfortable in one of these	2	7
as you would in your own skin.	2	7
Wayne Kirkby. Do you have a card?	2	7
Sterling Cooper.	2	7
Did Roger Sterling send you?	2	7
Yes.	2	7
Let me go and get the keys, Mr. Draper.	2	7
Don't you want to hold onto these?	2	7
I don't know. The '49 rattled.	2	7
 This is the 1 950 model.	2	7
It's quite different under the hood.	2	7
Don't talk to me.	2	7
Talk to him. It's his money.	2	7
I'm just here to make sure	2	7
you don't shake his hand and take his fingers.	2	7
Charlie, this car is two years old with only 25,000 miles on it.	2	7
It's what you want.	2	7
This must be Mrs. Wheatley.	2	7
No.	2	7
Why don't you sit in it again?	2	7
You two talk.	2	7
May l help you, ma'am?	2	7
Are you Donald Draper?	2	7
Yes, I am.	2	7
If it's about my circular, many of the models are gone,	2	7
but l'm sure we can find you something.	2	7
I'm not here to buy a car.	2	7
You're a hard man to find.	2	7
Excuse me?	2	7
You're not Don Draper.	2	7
Mr. Draper?	2	7
Everything okay?	2	7
Yes.	2	7
Let me take you for a ride.	2	7
No.	2	7
Thank you.	2	7
I don't hear that a lot.	2	7
Well.	2	7
Have a good day.	2	7
Good afternoon, Miss Siegal.	2	7
Mr. Sterling.	2	7
Is your boss in?	2	7
No, but he will be.	2	7
Where'd you get that sweater?	2	7
l want to make sure my daughter never buys it.	2	7
Klein's.	2	7
I doubt your daughter shops there.	2	7
Union Square, right? Is that where you live?	2	7
I've told you, all you have to do is look at my file.	2	7
That's cheating.	2	7
How was your lunch, Mr. Draper?	2	7
Good.	2	7
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.	2	7
Get Mr. Phillips.	2	7
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett called again.	2	7
Did she leave a message?	2	7
No.	2	7
ShalI I tell Mr. Phillips you returned?	2	7
Yes.	2	7
I'll bet she suffers in silence out there, hoping you'll notice her.	2	7
I don't think she cries at night from lack of attention.	2	7
Wait till she finds out about your Cadillac.	2	7
She'll be waiting naked right in front of this window.	2	7
Now you're thinking about her.	2	7
Didn't you go see Wayne?	2	7
I'm going to eliminate your objections right away.	2	7
First of all, you can afford it.	2	7
Do you know how invigorating it is	2	7
to go in and write a check for $6,500 and not care?	2	7
Secondly,	2	7
not to get too deep before the cocktail hour,	2	7
but do I need to remind you of the finite nature of life?	2	7
Mr. Phillips.	2	7
Send him in.	2	7
Like the song says, enjoy yourself.	2	7
It's later than you think.	2	7
Martinson Coffee.	2	7
Martinson's.	2	7
They changed it.	2	7
Change it back.	2	7
Jim Van Dyke told the people at Grey they're under review.	2	7
So Grey must be scrambling.	2	7
It's hard for them to do a lot of new work.	2	7
They just redesigned labels, displays, and dropped the S,	2	7
but they have some kids working on print and TV.	2	7
Are they better than our kids?	2	7
We'll find out.	2	7
WelI, you're welcome.	2	7
I spent Saturday birding with that man,	2	7
and by birding l mean sitting on a stump	2	7
with a pair of binoculars, whispering.	2	7
Did you see anything unusual?	2	7
A refrigerator floating in a pond.	2	7
Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith are here.	2	7
Just a minute.	2	7
Did you let them stay up late?	2	7
- I'd love to hear this. - l don't know.	2	7
If l fill you full of any more confidence, you'll burst.	2	7
You don't dance, or you don't dance with me?	2	7
Leave her alone. Let's go.	2	7
Heard you're gonna knock 'em dead.	2	7
Look, Don, it's pretty clear why we're here.	2	7
You want to know how our generation feels.	2	7
Okay.	2	7
So, I get this letter from my friend back in Michigan.	2	7
He's still in school, man,	2	7
and it's got this, I don't know,	2	7
60-page rant in it.	2	7
So dig it.	2	7
"""We would replace power"	2	7
"""rooted in possession, privilege, or circumstance"	2	7
"""by power and uniqueness"	2	7
"""rooted in Iove, reflectiveness,"	2	7
"reason, and creativity."""	2	7
That's a beautiful sentiment.	2	7
Does your friend know what you do for a living?	2	7
Yeah, there was a shitty note with it,	2	7
but this whole concept is deep.	2	7
"""Students for a Democratic Society."""	2	7
That's a hell of a focus group.	2	7
It's how our generation feels.	2	7
It is what it is.	2	7
It's idealistic.	2	7
That's nice.	2	7
Your generation wants to talk	2	7
about that newly designed can and the premium beans,	2	7
but we don't want to be told what we should do	2	7
or how we should act.	2	7
We just want to be.	2	7
You just want to be selling Martinson's Coffee?	2	7
Just listen to this.	2	7
So, the thought is,	2	7
every maternity ward will get a visit from a registered nurse	2	7
with a doll and a crate of Pampers,	2	7
and she will extol their virtues, which are many.	2	7
What did Draper say?	2	7
He liked it,	2	7
but he said the same thing he keeps saying.	2	7
I can't get them to lower the price.	2	7
Do you know the years of R&D P&G put into this?	2	7
Besides, they're worth it.	2	7
No boiIing, no diaper service, no plastic pants.	2	7
And the greatest benefit of all, you can throw them away.	2	7
1 0 cents apiece,	2	7
you kind of think you should reuse them.	2	7
Mr. Draper went over these ideas	2	7
and had thoughts he would like you all to discuss.	2	7
WelI, it's 5:00. Are we going out?	2	7
I don't know, sweetheart.	2	7
Maybe.	2	7
I'll take those papers.	2	7
Good night, Miss Olson.	2	7
Jane, would you mind helping us clean this up?	2	7
I'm meeting with Cooper tomorrow.	2	7
He said he wants to see me and only me.	2	7
Isn't that from West Side Story?	2	7
You know he's going to ask you about the picture.	2	7
What picture?	2	7
Some new painting.	2	7
He calls people in to see what they think.	2	7
No, I think we're going to discuss expanding the television department.	2	7
I heard it cost $1 0,000.	2	7
How does everybody know about this?	2	7
Are you making it up?	2	7
Last year, Harry went up to the roof looking for cosmonauts.	2	7
Has anyone seen it?	2	7
Dale.	2	7
It's abstract expressionist.	2	7
What the hell does that mean?	2	7
Thank you all for ruining this.	2	7
You're the one who walked to the opposite end of the office	2	7
to tell us you had a meeting.	2	7
Well, if you're lucky, you'Il have a meeting.	2	7
And I'm not going to telI you anything about the damn picture.	2	7
Why don't you just go look at it?	2	7
I'm sorry, Jane,	2	7
but you just don't walk into his office like that.	2	7
But he's gone for the day.	2	7
That doesn't matter.	2	7
Miss Blankenship won't mind .	2	7
I'm going to go up and see it.	2	7
I'll go anywhere you go.	2	7
WelI, she's gone.	2	7
What are you doing?	2	7
It's open.	2	7
Are you suicidal? Let's go.	2	7
I can't believe you all.	2	7
Take off your shoes.	2	7
I feel like we're skinny dipping.	2	7
Call me from jail.	2	7
You're gonna keep a lookout?	2	7
Just don't touch anything.	2	7
It's a Rothko.	2	7
Why the hell didn't Dale say that?	2	7
$1 0,000.	2	7
So it's smudgy squares?	2	7
That's interesting.	2	7
Two possibilities--	2	7
either Cooper loves it,	2	7
and you have to love it,	2	7
"like in an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" situation,"	2	7
or he thinks it's a joke	2	7
and you'll look like a fool if you pretend to dig it.	2	7
People like him pretend they understand this.	2	7
Maybe he has a brochure in here, something that explains it.	2	7
I don't think it's supposed to be explained .	2	7
I'm an artist, okay?	2	7
It must mean something.	2	7
Maybe it doesn't.	2	7
Maybe you're just supposed to experience it.	2	7
Because when you look at it, you do feel something, right?	2	7
It's like looking into something very deep.	2	7
You could fall in.	2	7
That's true.	2	7
Did someone tell you that?	2	7
How could someone tell you that?	2	7
This is pointless. Let's go.	2	7
I'm ready.	2	7
Harry actually took the stairs.	2	7
We could have stolen it, couldn't we?	2	7
Who are you?	2	7
I was thinking I could write a great short story about this--	2	7
"you know, ""The Day We Looked at the Painting."""	2	7
I'm a writer.	2	7
I thought you were an accountant.	2	7
Accounts.	2	7
I've been published.	2	7
The Atlantic Monthly, Parabolas.	2	7
That's right. The story about the maple tree.	2	7
It was beautiful and sad.	2	7
Really? You read it?	2	7
Everybody read it.	2	7
People were jealous.	2	7
Where are you headed? Are you hungry?	2	7
No. Good night.	2	7
So you're stilI working here.	2	7
You missed something, my yellow-bellied friend.	2	7
Jane Siegal is a genuine thrill.	2	7
Breaking and entering.	2	7
I don't care about Jane.	2	7
Tell me about Coop's painting.	2	7
What about Mr. Cooper's painting?	2	7
Enjoy that.	2	7
Can l get another coffee here, please?	2	7
I'll tell you what I heard.	2	7
You, Mr. Cosgrove, and Jane	2	7
were in Mr. Cooper's office looking at his painting.	2	7
Anything you'd like to correct?	2	7
Mind your own business.	2	7
I had nothing to do with it.	2	7
Thank you.	2	7
Nothing happened.	2	7
Look, if Kurt says we don't need artwork, we don't need artwork.	2	7
Is that what Kurt said?	2	7
Is that what you said?	2	7
Don has his signature.	2	7
It's nice down here.	2	7
Hey.	2	7
Kenneth.	2	7
3:00, and he doesn't talk in the meeting.	2	7
How about last night?	2	7
Quite an adventure.	2	7
Listen, I was thinking about what you said about my story,	2	7
about it being sad and beautiful?	2	7
You're not Iike everyone else around here.	2	7
I don't know if that's true.	2	7
Okay. Here goes.	2	7
Would you mind taking a look at this?	2	7
Are you kidding?	2	7
I don't want you to pull any punches.	2	7
Unless you hate it,	2	7
in which case, don't tell me.	2	7
I'm kind of fragile.	2	7
I'd be honored.	2	7
WelI, great, then.	2	7
Take your time.	2	7
Ken.	2	7
Yeah.	2	7
You know, I can probably read it by Sunday,	2	7
and you can come over for dinner,	2	7
you know, with Kitty and I .	2	7
I know you need a home-cooked meal.	2	7
You have plans?	2	7
No.	2	7
Are you sure it's okay?	2	7
You want me to give this back?	2	7
Young people do not drink coffee,	2	7
and that can become a lifetime habit.	2	7
Now, we're aware	2	7
that unsuccessful attempts have been made--	2	7
puppets and so forth--	2	7
to capture the attention of youth.	2	7
That's why we're here.	2	7
There's an old saying.	2	7
When one is in Indian country,	2	7
one needs a man who knows Indians.	2	7
Mr. Smith?	2	7
So.	2	7
Where do we start?	2	7
Joe Martinson.	2	7
Old cup of Joe.	2	7
They named it after him, right?	2	7
That's just ancient history now.	2	7
There have been a million ways that the folks on this avenue	2	7
have tried to telI our generation what to do.	2	7
Except we don't want to be told what to do.	2	7
That's over.	2	7
We want to find things for ourselves.	2	7
We want to feel.	2	7
Okay.	2	7
Martinson's is a great coffee.	2	7
It's delicious, and it's hot, and it's brown.	2	7
That's all you need to say.	2	7
We don't need more than that.	2	7
Peggy. Sweetheart?	2	7
I don't know if I understand this.	2	7
It's a jingle, right?	2	7
It's a song, and it's a mood,	2	7
and it's a feeling.	2	7
It's definitely more than a jingle.	2	7
What do you think?	2	7
It stays with you.	2	7
What are the pictures that go with this?	2	7
If you sign, we'll tell you.	2	7
So Media Purchases.	2	7
Starting in March, I'm looking at column 5,	2	7
under Regional Affiliates.	2	7
Mr. Crane, focus, please.	2	7
We didn't make you head of television just to shorten your attention span.	2	7
I'm sorry, sir.	2	7
I was admiring your painting.	2	7
The eye is drawn to it.	2	7
It's very modern.	2	7
Mark Rothko. I've read about him.	2	7
And?	2	7
What do you think about it?	2	7
Nobody has ever asked me that.	2	7
Probably because it's none of their business.	2	7
Right.	2	7
How does it strike you?	2	7
Sir, I know nothing about art.	2	7
Mr. Crane, you're here because of numbers.	2	7
Stick to that.	2	7
Don't concern yourseIf with aesthetics.	2	7
You'll get a headache.	2	7
Of course.	2	7
People buy things to realize their aspirations.	2	7
It's the foundation of our business.	2	7
But between you and me and the lamppost,	2	7
that thing shouId double in value by next Christmas.	2	7
Where were we?	2	7
Column 5 here-- Regional Newspaper Affiliates.	2	7
Your hair is turning green.	2	7
You have to wear the bathing cap.	2	7
It squeezes my head .	2	7
Don't leave your wet suit on the floor.	2	7
Draper residence.	2	7
Is this the belle of the Hudson River Valley?	2	7
Who is this?	2	7
It's Jimmy Barrett, sweetheart.	2	7
Mr. Barrett.	2	7
Are you Iooking for Don?	2	7
Because he's at the office.	2	7
I know exactly what I'm doing.	2	7
ABC picked up Grin and Barrett, my TV show, 39 episodes.	2	7
That's wonderful. Congratulations.	2	7
We're having a shindig at the Stork Club.	2	7
Donnie didn't get back to me,	2	7
so I figured if you're anything like my wife,	2	7
you book the dance card.	2	7
Monday night, so the celebrities can come.	2	7
That sounds like fun,	2	7
but celebrities make me shy.	2	7
Keep playing that, gorgeous.	2	7
It works wonders.	2	7
I'll talk to Don about it.	2	7
Don't you want to go?	2	7
You can't leave me alone with those people.	2	7
Ride the horse in, like Lady Godiva.	2	7
I think I should hang up now.	2	7
Betty,	2	7
it would mean a lot to me if you were there.	2	7
We wiIl try. Have a nice day, Jimmy.	2	7
Mr. Phillips.	2	7
Right now there's a little boy	2	7
running over here from Martinson Coffee	2	7
with a check in his hand.	2	7
It's done. Congratulations.	2	7
Thanks.	2	7
You want me to send for something for you?	2	7
No, but don't let me dampen your spirits.	2	7
Unfurl the sails, please.	2	7
That was good advance work.	2	7
That's my job.	2	7
Maybe we'll get a shot at LifeSavers.	2	7
Mr. Cooper wants to speak with you.	2	7
We'll be right there.	2	7
He just asked for you, Mr. Draper.	2	7
Thanks again.	2	7
CongratuIations, Don.	2	7
Sit with us.	2	7
Thank you.	2	7
But I didn't do it alone.	2	7
Fascinating.	2	7
Jim Van Dyke of Martinson Coffee was thoroughly impressed.	2	7
He's inviting you to join the board	2	7
of the Museum of Early American Folk Arts.	2	7
That's nice.	2	7
What is it?	2	7
Doesn't exist yet.	2	7
But I've seen the opening exhibit.	2	7
Whirligigs.	2	7
Do they need a campaign?	2	7
No. Philanthropy is the gateway to power.	2	7
If you say so.	2	7
We need you to continue your excellence in advertising,	2	7
but also to start treating this like part of a bigger business,	2	7
which it is.	2	7
I will.	2	7
Do you understand what this means?	2	7
You're going to be wearing your tuxedo a lot more.	2	7
It's time for the horse to catch the carrot.	2	7
Roger, would you mind?	2	7
Would you agree that l know a little bit about you?	2	7
A little.	2	7
There are few people who get to decide what will happen in our world .	2	7
You have been invited to join them.	2	7
Pull back the curtain and take your seat.	2	7
You're back.	2	7
I had a feeling.	2	7
You want to take it for a drive?	2	7
Wayne, I would like to buy this car.	2	7
Jane, would you come with me, pIease?	2	7
Is something wrong?	2	7
Just tell me.	2	7
You want to have this conversation here?	2	7
Fine.	2	7
You broke into Mr. Cooper's office with some executives after hours.	2	7
That's not true.	2	7
I'm not in the habit of making empty accusations.	2	7
They made me. l had no choice.	2	7
Please. They'll do anything you say.	2	7
You work for Mr. Draper.	2	7
What's wrong with you?	2	7
With me?	2	7
Yes.	2	7
Are you the only one who's allowed to have fun around here?	2	7
What?	2	7
Please. I don't need a mother.	2	7
I'm 20 years old .	2	7
Collect your things.	2	7
What?	2	7
Get your things.	2	7
You can't be serious.	2	7
You want to have this conversation again in front of Mr. Draper?	2	7
I'm going to the break room to find your replacement.	2	7
See that you are gone by the time I return.	2	7
Don!	2	7
You like it?	2	7
I don't know what to say.	2	7
It's gorgeous.	2	7
Slide over.	2	7
It's like the cockpit of a jet.	2	7
What's this for?	2	7
That is a headlight sensor.	2	7
It automatically dims the lights as you approach another car.	2	7
And these seats.	2	7
It was expensive.	2	7
- Do you love it? - I do.	2	7
WelI, you deserve it. You work so hard.	2	7
I can't wait to pull up to the Stork Club in this.	2	7
Any time you want.	2	7
Monday night?	2	7
Jimmy Barrett's throwing a party for his TV show.	2	7
He called for you.	2	7
He called here?	2	7
He should have gone through my secretary.	2	7
I think he likes talking to me.	2	7
The kids won't be home for an hour.	2	7
Want to take her around the block?	2	7
Not in here.	2	7
Mr. Sterling?	2	7
I'm sorry. Ginger stepped away.	2	7
Well. Hello there.	2	7
I just wanted to say good-bye and thank you for being so kind to me.	2	7
Good-bye?	2	7
I've been fired.	2	7
Draper's a tough desk, honey.	2	7
Actually, it was Miss Holloway.	2	7
I can see someone wanting to reprimand you seriously.	2	7
But firing? It's a little permanent.	2	7
Do you want a drink?	2	7
Not like you work here anymore.	2	7
Would you Iike to tell me what happened?	2	7
You don't need to bother with this.	2	7
I want to.	2	7
I'm just trying to do my job.	2	7
Miss Holloway is. . .	2	7
WelI, she's going through a rough time.	2	7
She's engaged, you know.	2	7
Tell you what.	2	7
You go home--	2	7
Where do you live?	2	7
In the Village.	2	7
Jane Street.	2	7
Jane on Jane Street.	2	7
That's a pretty picture.	2	7
Listen, you go home to your little apartment on Jane Street.	2	7
By the time you come back here on Monday morning,	2	7
this will all be taken care of.	2	7
Are you sure?	2	7
No more tears.	2	7
I don't know what to say.	2	7
Thank you, Mr. Sterling. Thank you so much.	2	7
Roger.	2	7
That's my favorite tie.	2	7
He's late. I was expecting that.	2	7
He is a bachelor.	2	7
You could smell heaven in the street.	2	7
I'd like to take credit, but it's all the maestro.	2	7
These are beautiful.	2	7
Don't forget to put an aspirin in the bottom.	2	7
Keeps 'em fresh.	2	7
I know that. I told you that.	2	7
Can l offer you a drink?	2	7
Beer if you have it.	2	7
But wine with the spaghetti. Okay?	2	7
Your place is. . .really wild.	2	7
Once we decided not to look for a bigger place,	2	7
we just Iet ourselves go.	2	7
How did you two meet?	2	7
It's a boring story.	2	7
No, it's not.	2	7
I grew up a block away from him in Baltimore.	2	7
l guess I just always had a crush on an older man.	2	7
As soon as I moved my mother up here, Kitty came along.	2	7
Come, come. Taste this sauce.	2	7
Now, tell me what you think, and be honest.	2	7
I'm fragile.	2	7
It's really good.	2	7
It's better than a restaurant.	2	7
I don't want this hanging in the air.	2	7
- What are you talking about? - My story.	2	7
I don't want to sit here the whole meal worrying	2	7
and then find out you didn't read it or that you did and you didn't like it.	2	7
Are you kidding? I loved it.	2	7
- Loved what? - His story.	2	7
Yes. He wouldn't stop talking about it, but he won't let me read it.	2	7
I didn't know how you felt.	2	7
I wonder if one day they'll rent this apartment	2	7
by bragging about the fact that you ate here once.	2	7
I'm going to be eating here all the time.	2	7
"To ""The Gold Violin,"" by Kenneth Cosgrove."	2	7
You really liked it?	2	7
I did. It was lovely.	2	7
I saw one at the Met.	2	7
It's perfect in every way, except it couldn't make music.	2	7
Oh, my.	2	7
Well, shall we?	2	7
Is Bobby in the car again?	2	7
No. He's running around.	2	7
So I don't understand.	2	7
"You'd rather play checkers than my ""look at the clouds"" game."	2	7
I'd rather play with Silly Putty.	2	7
I don't want it jammed between my seats.	2	7
You know what, Sally? Go play with Bobby.	2	7
We should do this more often.	2	7
We should only do this.	2	7
I have to go pee-pee.	2	7
Go behind a tree there. No one's looking.	2	7
I want to tinkle outside.	2	7
I don't know.	2	7
It's different for boys.	2	7
I think everybody should go before we get in the car.	2	7
Do you have to go?	2	7
No.	2	7
You kids are lucky.	2	7
When l was a little boy,	2	7
back on the farm,	2	7
we had an outhouse way out in the yard.	2	7
And on nights when there was no moon,	2	7
there was this rope,	2	7
and you had to feeI for it in the dark and pull yourself across.	2	7
I'm glad we didn't live in the olden days.	2	7
Are we rich?	2	7
It's not polite to talk about money.	2	7
I did it!	2	7
We should probably get going if we don't want to hit traffic.	2	7
Sally, pack up the checkers.	2	7
Check their hands.	2	7
Okay.	2	7
You get the last of it.	2	7
Should I get another?	2	7
You can have mine.	2	7
Harry tell you anything about his meeting?	2	7
Harry's meeting with who?	2	7
Mr. Cooper.	2	7
He says he knows the answer now.	2	7
Well? What was it?	2	7
He says I wouldn't understand.	2	7
Where do you live, Ken?	2	7
Murray Hill.	2	7
I can waIk to the office, but I don't.	2	7
I wonder if you're gonna get a call.	2	7
I'm pretty sure he's going through the whole roster.	2	7
Although, Cosgrove comes before Crane, right?	2	7
My cousin has an advertising agency in Montreal.	2	7
He's not interested in that.	2	7
How the heck did you end up in accounts?	2	7
Me and a bunch of my college buddies heard there was dough.	2	7
I was the only one who got a job.	2	7
What about writing?	2	7
That's just for fun.	2	7
It's your hobby.	2	7
I should go.	2	7
You can't.	2	7
Don't you want coffee?	2	7
Would it be rude to say that I have a long ride back to Manhattan?	2	7
I can wrap up a piece of pie for you.	2	7
- It's pine nuts and pineapple. - If I eat any more,	2	7
I'll burst.	2	7
You two have been wonderful.	2	7
Thanks for reading the story.	2	7
You can let her read it.	2	7
I can't wait.	2	7
I'll see you tomorrow, l guess.	2	7
Do you want to have some pie?	2	7
No. I'm not hungry.	2	7
I'm just going to clean up.	2	7
Do you even care that l want dessert?	2	7
Of course I do. I'll go get it.	2	7
I'll get it.	2	7
What's the matter, Kitty?	2	7
I don't work where you do.	2	7
I've met these people once.	2	7
How am l supposed to talk about them?	2	7
Come on, Kitty.	2	7
Do you even see me here?	2	7
Well, of course I do.	2	7
WelI, you wouldn't know it, Salvatore.	2	7
I'm sorry.	2	7
We were just talking about work.	2	7
You're right.	2	7
It was rude.	2	7
I tried to include myseIf.	2	7
A lot of people find me very interesting, you know?	2	7
I am so sorry, Kitty.	2	7
It's okay.	2	7
I'll get you some pie.	2	7
You put your feet up.	2	7
I'll take care of the kitchen.	2	7
Okay.	2	7
I have tickets for the Mets tonight.	2	7
Great seats for probably a terrible game.	2	7
I'll be by at 5.	2	7
No, you won't, and please don't lurk near my desk.	2	7
I'm being watched.	2	7
Okay.	2	7
WelI, have a good day.	2	7
Good morning.	2	7
Morning.	2	7
I was going to calI Kitty today,	2	7
but I don't know what it's like with Italian people	2	7
if you call someone's wife.	2	7
It's okay.	2	7
Give her a call. She'd like that.	2	7
WelI, I just wanted to thank her-- both of you, really.	2	7
Every once in a while,	2	7
you wish you weren't a bachelor, you know?	2	7
And your home is kind of what l have in mind,	2	7
the way you two are.	2	7
WelI, we really enjoyed having you.	2	7
What on God's green earth are you doing here?	2	7
Did Mr. Sterling speak with you?	2	7
No.	2	7
What could he possibly have to do with this?	2	7
I'll do whatever you want, but he said that you do this a lot.	2	7
Do what?	2	7
Lose your temper.	2	7
That you're impetuous and it's not serious.	2	7
And what were you doing talking to Mr. Sterling?	2	7
I ran into him on my way out.	2	7
Did you?	2	7
Is there a problem?	2	7
No.	2	7
There's no problem at aIl.	2	7
It's very clear.	2	7
Everyone looks so glamorous.	2	7
Believe me, they're saying that about you.	2	7
It's my earrings.	2	7
Do you remember? Bermuda?	2	7
I do.	2	7
Here he is.	2	7
Don Draper.	2	7
I heard you had something to do with this.	2	7
Very little.	2	7
Betty, this is Andrew Colhold with ABC.	2	7
A pleasure to meet you.	2	7
And you.	2	7
Isn't this a pleasant surprise?	2	7
Hello, Mrs. Draper. You look stunning.	2	7
Don.	2	7
Hello, Mrs. Barrett.	2	7
Don, did Andrew tell you my idea for working a few items into the show?	2	7
Not yet.	2	7
Why don't I get us some drinks?	2	7
That's okay. Let me get them.	2	7
I'll do it.	2	7
No, it sounds like you three have business to discuss.	2	7
For example, a woman's parking her car,	2	7
and then Jimmy runs out and says she's run over his Rolex watch,	2	7
so then we show the watch.	2	7
Of course Jimmy will need a Rolex, I suppose.	2	7
I don't care, as long as we bury Candid Camera.	2	7
If you're trying to blend into the wall, you can't.	2	7
Hello, Jimmy.	2	7
Hello, gorgeous.	2	7
What are you doing standing here all alone?	2	7
They're talking business.	2	7
I fled.	2	7
I'd better not.	2	7
I've had too much already.	2	7
I insist.	2	7
The drunker you are, the funnier l become.	2	7
ABC did research.	2	7
Come on. Let's keep each other company.	2	7
I wish l was a mosquito right now.	2	7
I would never leave you alone.	2	7
Come to think of it, l never do, do I?	2	7
No, you don't.	2	7
I'd want you on my arm.	2	7
Look at us, over here at the kids' tabIe.	2	7
What do you mean?	2	7
Them. Your husband.	2	7
I've been standing behind guys like that my whoIe life.	2	7
I was lucky I was funny.	2	7
If I wasn't funny, I would never have gotten to meet you.	2	7
- That's not true. - It is.	2	7
It's hard to believe there's anything better than you.	2	7
Hard to believe he could do any better than you .	2	7
Please stop.	2	7
What do you think happened between the two of them?	2	7
Excuse me?	2	7
Oh, come on. Look at them.	2	7
I don't like what you're saying.	2	7
All I know is I know her, and you know him,	2	7
and there they are, and they don't care where we are.	2	7
Stop it.	2	7
- Hold on. - Let me go.	2	7
I don't like it any more than you do.	2	7
You people are ugly and crude.	2	7
What people? You mean comedians?	2	7
. . .a very unusual emergency.	2	7
You know what must really annoy him?	2	7
All the interruptions when we're not at home--	2	7
signing for deliveries, answering the phone,	2	7
turning on the oven.	2	7
You know I never ask him to do that sort of thing	2	7
unless it's impossible for me to be here.	2	7
How about that Thanksgiving	2	7
when your car broke down and Daddy had to leave his office	2	7
every 1 5 minutes to baste?	2	7
Your father never complains or anything.	2	7
WelI, no. Daddy wouldn't.	2	7
I guess he wouIdn't.	2	7
Leaving so soon?	2	7
We didn't get to talk.	2	7
Betty's not feeling well.	2	7
Too bad.	2	7
Here, let me get that.	2	7
It's the least I can do.	2	7
Thanks to you, I got everything I wanted.	2	7
I don't know if that's possible, Jimmy.	2	7
I got my relationship with Utz,	2	7
my show, my money, 39 on the air.	2	7
I'm gonna be an institution.	2	7
I'll tell everyone I know.	2	7
You know what I like about you? Nothing.	2	7
But it's okay.	2	7
You got me everything I wanted.	2	7
What did you get?	2	7
Bobbie?	2	7
Lots of people have had that.	2	7
Excuse me?	2	7
Please. I laugh at you.	2	7
I go home at night, and I laugh at you.	2	7
I don't know what you think happened.	2	7
You. You want to step out, fine.	2	7
Go to a whore.	2	7
You don't screw another man's wife.	2	7
You're garbage.	2	7
And you know it.	2	7
Well.	2	7
Good night, you two.	2	7
It's been a gas.	2	7
Subtitled By J. R. Media Services, lnc. Burbank, CA	2	7
When did you get up?	2	8
I don't know.	2	8
Is it still Saturday?	2	8
I need you to fix the outlet in the dining room.	2	8
I thought you were going to call an electrician.	2	8
All you need to do is unscrew the fuse and replace the plug, Don.	2	8
Sounds like you could do it.	2	8
I need to be able to plug in the hot plate.	2	8
Okay.	2	8
Okay.	2	8
Bets, come here.	2	8
 Look, you've got a week before this party,	2	8
and it doesn't have to be a big deal.	2	8
Carla will help you.	2	8
We're going to have a house full of people.	2	8
I'd appreciate it if you'd take care of the things on the list.	2	8
Birdie, I'll fix it.	2	8
Thank you.	2	8
Hello.	2	8
Perfect timing. Ma just left.	2	8
I brought colored pencils for the boys.	2	8
They're out back throwing rocks at my laundry.	2	8
How is he?	2	8
I don't know.	2	8
I told you about the chiropractor.	2	8
 They're not doctors.	2	8
Did I tell you he cried?	2	8
Anita...	2	8
Sometimes I think about Mike Ryan. Remember him?	2	8
Stop it. Gerry has a job.	2	8
He hates it.	2	8
He told me he hated it,	2	8
and then a week later his back started.	2	8
His buddies from work don't even come by anymore.	2	8
They think he's a malingerer.	2	8
And Ma, all she can talk about are her bunions.	2	8
I checked out the next Horatio Hornblower for him.	2	8
I was right. There is only one book about Moby Dick.	2	8
Him with the books.	2	8
Who is it?	2	8
I don't know.	2	8
Oh, Lord.	2	8
Hello, Father. What a pleasant surprise.	2	8
Well, I'm sorry for dropping in.	2	8
I just thought that he could use a visit.	2	8
Bless you.	2	8
How is he?	2	8
Much better, thanks.	2	8
Good, good. I'm glad.	2	8
- Hello, Peggy. - Hello, Father.	2	8
Let me see if he's awake.	2	8
No, please don't disturb him.	2	8
Nonsense. He'll be thrilled.	2	8
It means a lot that you're visiting.	2	8
You as well, I'm sure.	2	8
Are you hungry?	2	8
I've already been fed a few times today.	2	8
It's a wonderful community, you know?	2	8
It is.	2	8
I see you at church, but you don't seem very comfortable.	2	8
No. That's not true.	2	8
You don't participate. You keep to yourself.	2	8
You know, there are many ways to be involved.	2	8
There's a committee for the CYO dance.	2	8
And for selfish reasons,	2	8
I would love to take advantage of your professional services again.	2	8
What do you mean?	2	8
Publicity.	2	8
Last year's poster was girls in garlands dancing around a maypole.	2	8
I don't think that's what the kids want.	2	8
No. They don't.	2	8
I'm so busy right now, Father.	2	8
Think of it as pro bono.	2	8
Talk to your boss.	2	8
I really would like the kids to show up.	2	8
He's ready to see you, Father.	2	8
I'll get you the specifics.	2	8
As of today, you are costing this company more than you are making it.	2	8
Excuse me?	2	8
Tim Dunst called from Maytag.	2	8
Apparently, last night, their switchboard lit up like a Christmas tree.	2	8
- I didn't hear... - You're head of the television department,	2	8
so I know you can't watch everything.	2	8
But who exactly oversaw the placement	2	8
of Maytag in The ABC Sunday Night Movie?	2	8
Well, I take full responsibility.	2	8
There was a scene with a murderous Russian spy	2	8
who was referred to as an agitator repeatedly,	2	8
and this led into a Maytag spot,	2	8
"the title of which is ""The Amazing Agitator. """	2	8
Really?	2	8
Is this all a big joke to you?	2	8
The Russians are still our enemy, you know.	2	8
This will not happen again.	2	8
Crane, we're eating this one.	2	8
Politics aside, you need to be aware	2	8
that a client will take any excuse not to pay us.	2	8
You need to get your department in line, or I'll gut it.	2	8
Yes, sir.	2	8
I'll get to the bottom of this.	2	8
Hey, Harry, what's the name of that place we went to	2	8
with the wallpaper and the kebabs?	2	8
I don't remember.	2	8
Can one of you help me read TV scripts?	2	8
For money?	2	8
I don't think so.	2	8
There's too much to read, and I have nobody.	2	8
There are things to do that I didn't know were my job.	2	8
How could that be? You made that job up.	2	8
I thought I would be a liaison between the networks and the agency	2	8
and, I don't know, buy time.	2	8
That's what your job was before.	2	8
So now what? It's a whole 'nother job.	2	8
That's why we have juniors.	2	8
Someone to blame.	2	8
You need someone to lay down on the barbed wire	2	8
so you can run over them.	2	8
Heineken was pleased but confused.	2	8
By the fact that you don't use their product?	2	8
That's why I brought Campbell.	2	8
So what's the problem?	2	8
They're set on competing at the tap.	2	8
We just have to find a way to excite your average tavern inhabitant,	2	8
and they'll be happy.	2	8
Did you explain to them that there's a market	2	8
that's actually excited about Heineken being imported?	2	8
For women entertaining in the home, Holland is Paris.	2	8
They can buy this sophisticated beer	2	8
and proudly walk it into the kitchen instead of hiding it in the garage.	2	8
I'm just telling you I sensed resistance.	2	8
If you want to get some research,	2	8
I'll get them into a room with you again.	2	8
Okay.	2	8
We'll go up and down the Hudson,	2	8
northern New Jersey, Connecticut, the cash belt...	2	8
set up a few end-aisle displays at the A&Ps,	2	8
away from the other beer,	2	8
surrounded by cheese and crackers and toothpicks with cellophane tips.	2	8
We can try that.	2	8
Maybe short, uneven stacks.	2	8
Make it look popular.	2	8
Plus, housewives love green.	2	8
We'll go make some calls.	2	8
You're still going to have to sit down and sell this to them.	2	8
By the way, I hate to disappoint your wife,	2	8
but I don't know about Sunday night.	2	8
I'd worry more about disappointing Roger.	2	8
He seemed to think it was important that we sit down with Crab Colson.	2	8
And believe me, I'm sure my wife would rather go see a movie.	2	8
Who's Crab Colson?	2	8
Rogers and Cowan.	2	8
I'll get the time from your girl again.	2	8
Mr. Sterling is here to see you.	2	8
Send him in, please.	2	8
- Roger. - Crane.	2	8
Mitch says you want to expand your department.	2	8
Looks pretty big already.	2	8
Well, the way other television departments have this set up...	2	8
and I've checked on this...	2	8
there should be a dedicated man for Broadcast Operations.	2	8
And what is he dedicated to?	2	8
Reading scripts, meetings to discuss.	2	8
I'm really the face of the television department for the clients.	2	8
Have you noticed we're full up?	2	8
Who's going to pay this person, you?	2	8
The money we save avoiding surprises will make it worthwhile.	2	8
You smoke, Crane?	2	8
Sometimes.	2	8
How do I know you're not just goldbricking?	2	8
Because that's what Mitch thinks.	2	8
I don't want to speak out of turn...	2	8
Warren, do you mind?	2	8
I don't think Mitch has been very happy with my recent promotion.	2	8
Are you?	2	8
Yes, of course.	2	8
Figure out a way to do the job yourself.	2	8
You better not repeat any of that to Mitch.	2	8
Peggy Olson's office.	2	8
May I speak with Miss Olson?	2	8
This is Father John Gill calling.	2	8
Peggy Olson speaking.	2	8
Hello, Peggy. This is Father John Gill.	2	8
Do you have a minute?	2	8
Yes. Did you get the flyer?	2	8
Yes.	2	8
It's good, but can you take whatever this is	2	8
and make it into a poster?	2	8
What do you mean, whatever this is?	2	8
Well, there's been some discussion.	2	8
Don't you like it?	2	8
"The CYO committee is curious about ""A Night to Remember. """	2	8
What's the problem?	2	8
Well, they feel it sends the wrong message to the girls.	2	8
It's wholesome and romantic.	2	8
And you have to get the girls.	2	8
It's the only way the boys will come.	2	8
Well...	2	8
Tell them that this is the way it works,	2	8
and I know better than them.	2	8
Peggy, couldn't you just speak with them?	2	8
They just want to feel involved.	2	8
Of course.	2	8
I'd love to hear their thoughts.	2	8
Good-bye, Father.	2	8
Good-bye.	2	8
Unlike some deodorants,	2	8
Fresh doesn't promise you eternal romance.	2	8
Mr. Crane, may I be of some assistance?	2	8
I'm sorry.	2	8
What?	2	8
I received a memo from Mr. Sterling's office,	2	8
saying that you needed a girl to help you with your workload.	2	8
No, that's not exactly what I asked for.	2	8
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but we are spread very thin.	2	8
Hello, Joan.	2	8
Hello, Warren.	2	8
You...	2	8
You look great today.	2	8
Thank you, Warren.	2	8
I need someone to run our commercial scripts	2	8
past the networks for approval.	2	8
Can't you just use a messenger?	2	8
No. That person also has to read the network scripts for me	2	8
and really make sure our clients aren't misrepresented.	2	8
I don't feel comfortable sending my girls out of the building,	2	8
but I will find someone to read the scripts.	2	8
My wife is pregnant.	2	8
I just want to get out of here at a reasonable hour.	2	8
How many are there?	2	8
And what are they looking for?	2	8
We just want to nip any problems in the bud.	2	8
For example, if a kid's pushing away his dinner in disgust,	2	8
just make sure it's not Gorton's fish sticks.	2	8
You know, people can't be coughing and dying	2	8
right before a Lucky ad.	2	8
Things like that. It's common sense, really.	2	8
It sounds interesting.	2	8
It is. For the first few.	2	8
And there's Maytag in there.	2	8
They're very sensitive to Communism.	2	8
Why can't I do that?	2	8
Because you already have a job.	2	8
No. I mean talk to her like that.	2	8
She's so much woman.	2	8
You are so graceful.	2	8
She is adorable.	2	8
They're doing Winnie the Pooh this year.	2	8
She's going to be Piglet.	2	8
It's all very professional-looking.	2	8
Cheryl's 14. She won't even waltz on my feet anymore.	2	8
Ours is engaged.	2	8
Enjoy it while you can.	2	8
Crab, can I get you another one of those?	2	8
Like the song says, I'd be a fool to say no.	2	8
- Roger? - Ladies first.	2	8
All right, the evening show is over.	2	8
Bedtime. Say good-bye to everybody.	2	8
Good night.	2	8
Good night.	2	8
- Good night, slugger. - Good night.	2	8
Hello.	2	8
Hello, Mrs. Draper.	2	8
Betty.	2	8
These are beautiful.	2	8
I'm sorry I'm late. My date cancelled.	2	8
You should have called.	2	8
I might have been able to replace her.	2	8
Carla, would you please put these in water?	2	8
And our head count is now seven.	2	8
What a lovely home.	2	8
Hello, Duck.	2	8
I remember you, Sally.	2	8
Hello.	2	8
And who do we have here?	2	8
This is Bobby.	2	8
Bobby, shake Mr. Phillips' hand.	2	8
Do you like baseball, Bobby?	2	8
Come on. Let's go to bed.	2	8
Sorry I'm late. I didn't want to come stag.	2	8
Nobody cares.	2	8
I don't know. My wife hated odd numbers.	2	8
Well, hello, there.	2	8
Duck Phillips, you know Mona.	2	8
Of course.	2	8
Hello.	2	8
Of course this is Petra and Crab Colson.	2	8
Crab, Duck. Duck, Crab.	2	8
Can I get you something?	2	8
Tomato juice, if you have it.	2	8
Come on.	2	8
I'll have something with dinner.	2	8
Beautiful drive.	2	8
- Did you take the Sawmill? - I did.	2	8
Found myself heading to New Rochelle by accident.	2	8
I used to live there.	2	8
It's lovely there.	2	8
I'll tell you the way to go.	2	8
We're taking our sloop from my folks' place in Old Lyme	2	8
all the way down to Larchmont for Race Week.	2	8
We should get a boat.	2	8
My father had a boat. Almost killed him.	2	8
You might as well cut a hole in your pocket.	2	8
The slip and the dry dock and the yacht club.	2	8
Speaking of which, Don,	2	8
are you and Bets joining Willow Caks or not?	2	8
We're lonely.	2	8
If you wish, you can leave your drinks here	2	8
and join us in the dining room.	2	8
Terrific.	2	8
So, Rogers & Cowan.	2	8
It's a good place to be right now.	2	8
He does everything you need him to do, you know?	2	8
Well, we took the road that goes to...	2	8
How did that get there?	2	8
We're going to take a little trip around the world,	2	8
starting in Spain with gazpacho,	2	8
followed by Japan... rumaki...	2	8
and then we'll stop by Duchess County	2	8
for a leg of lamb, mint jelly,	2	8
accompanied by egg noodles,	2	8
the way my grandmother made them from Germany.	2	8
And we have a choice of burgundy from France	2	8
or a frosted glass of beer from Holland.	2	8
Did you bring a case from work?	2	8
No.	2	8
Oh, please, Draper.	2	8
You'll do anything to win an argument.	2	8
I don't understand.	2	8
You went out and bought that? At the store?	2	8
Carla did some of the marketing,	2	8
but no, I did. Why?	2	8
I'm not even allowed to pick where I sit.	2	8
What's so funny?	2	8
Crab, if you want to be in business	2	8
with someone who knows their stuff...	2	8
Heineken is one of our clients.	2	8
He said you were the market, and you are.	2	8
- That is funny. - Incredible.	2	8
What an interesting experiment.	2	8
I have to sit down.	2	8
Please do.	2	8
Now who wants wine?	2	8
Please start.	2	8
The soup is delicious.	2	8
To our hosts.	2	8
And their idyllic country home,	2	8
and to new friends.	2	8
Hear, hear.	2	8
"""A Night to Remember"" is every girl's dream."	2	8
It holds the wholesome promise of the kind of hand-holding	2	8
that eventually leads to marriage.	2	8
I think it's exactly what we talked about.	2	8
I don't like the way they're dancing.	2	8
They're too close together.	2	8
Maybe leave some room for the Holy Ghost.	2	8
Uh, maybe they're doing a box step.	2	8
Fine.	2	8
You're not worried about having a dance full of girls only?	2	8
When the boys hear that the girls are going...	2	8
The boys aren't going to hear nothing.	2	8
They don't go to school together.	2	8
They go to church together.	2	8
And this isn't the first CYO event.	2	8
That's true.	2	8
I'd never thought about that, but you're right.	2	8
I'm just saying I'm not an expert,	2	8
but there might be another slogan.	2	8
What do you want, two flyers?	2	8
No. We don't have to throw this one away,	2	8
but maybe we can, um...	2	8
I think she's saying maybe we should try something else.	2	8
Thank you very much. I'll see what I can do.	2	8
You're such a doll.	2	8
Could I speak to you a minute?	2	8
Father, I wanted to talk to you, too.	2	8
We can speak tomorrow.	2	8
Thank you all for your generosity and your time.	2	8
Father, I don't mind working,	2	8
but this is completely unnecessary.	2	8
Well, I don't understand.	2	8
Did you agree with them?	2	8
The dancers could be farther apart,	2	8
but you were very persuasive.	2	8
You don't have to agree with them.	2	8
In fact, you're not supposed to.	2	8
You asked me to do this based on my expertise.	2	8
Well, I'm not really on the committee.	2	8
I'm more of a liaison.	2	8
You're supposed to tell them that they should trust me.	2	8
That's your job.	2	8
They'll listen to you.	2	8
You're right.	2	8
I'm sorry this is so much work.	2	8
No, I can turn it around.	2	8
And the copy machine?	2	8
Yes, I cleared it.	2	8
I'm sorry, Father.	2	8
I don't mean to be disrespectful.	2	8
I'm very tired.	2	8
We'll both be prepared next time.	2	8
Come on.	2	8
Good night, Peggy.	2	8
I really am glad you're here.	2	8
Me, too.	2	8
You didn't set the table?	2	8
I'm sorry. You came back so fast.	2	8
I'll get plates.	2	8
You're not going to believe what happens on As the World Turns.	2	8
You're right about that.	2	8
Let me ask you something.	2	8
Is it possible for someone to come out of a coma	2	8
and have no recollection of who they are?	2	8
Honestly, people don't come out of comas much.	2	8
Really?	2	8
So it's also probably ridiculous	2	8
they would have an accent they didn't have beforehand?	2	8
Yes.	2	8
Well, it must have happened to somebody.	2	8
I mean, they wouldn't make it up completely, right?	2	8
Probably once. Makes a good story.	2	8
I'm going to get my drink. Do you want something?	2	8
Water.	2	8
I didn't know you were such a reader.	2	8
It's part of my job.	2	8
I thought you just walked around with people staring at you.	2	8
You.	2	8
What are you bothering with that for?	2	8
You should be looking for a house.	2	8
What happened to your fascination with Glen Cove?	2	8
You told me to stop looking.	2	8
Well, I just need to finish my training.	2	8
Joanie, you should be watching those shows, not reading them,	2	8
with a box of bonbons on your lap to soothe your cravings.	2	8
It's a hoot.	2	8
I guess that's okay.	2	8
I'm glad you approve.	2	8
Were you going to get me a glass of water, hon?	2	8
Of course.	2	8
Carla, why don't you go home?	2	8
We can do all this in the morning.	2	8
That jam will set.	2	8
Let me at least put the dishes in the basin.	2	8
That's a good idea.	2	8
If you want, you can go to bed.	2	8
I'll show myself out, call Louis to pick me up.	2	8
It's okay. We had a long day.	2	8
Thank you for all your help.	2	8
Good night, Mr. Draper.	2	8
Good night, Carla.	2	8
It was a great success.	2	8
Hey.	2	8
You embarrassed me.	2	8
What are you talking about?	2	8
You embarrassed me.	2	8
What did I do?	2	8
You knew I would buy that beer.	2	8
So what?	2	8
Because you know me so well.	2	8
You know everything about me.	2	8
Bets, I use our life all the time in my work.	2	8
They pay me for that.	2	8
And then you laughed.	2	8
You all laughed.	2	8
Must be so funny being in on it.	2	8
Come on.	2	8
You're taking this the wrong way.	2	8
You embarrassed me.	2	8
I'm sorry.	2	8
I didn't mean it.	2	8
You never mean it.	2	8
You just do whatever you want,	2	8
and I put up with it because nobody knows.	2	8
No one is going to remember that.	2	8
You know what they're going to remember?	2	8
Petra Colson missing her chair.	2	8
Come on. Leave this. You're tired.	2	8
Let's go upstairs.	2	8
I'm not going to bed.	2	8
Not until you tell me why you insist on humiliating me.	2	8
Betty, I can't talk to you when you're like this.	2	8
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.	2	8
I know about you and that woman.	2	8
What?	2	8
Damn it, Don, I know you're having an affair.	2	8
You and Bobbie Barrett.	2	8
What?	2	8
How could you? She's so old.	2	8
Betty, that's ridiculous.	2	8
I'm just telling you I know.	2	8
Fine, Bets.	2	8
What do you know?	2	8
Go ahead. Tell me.	2	8
Jimmy told me everything.	2	8
Jimmy. He hates me.	2	8
He told me everything.	2	8
Please. What the hell did he say?	2	8
So you can pick it apart? Twist all my words?	2	8
I'm not going to dignify Jimmy Barrett with a response.	2	8
He's a big mouth.	2	8
And don't pretend I don't know how he looks at you.	2	8
I saw you two together.	2	8
You think you know me?	2	8
Well, I know what kind of a man you are.	2	8
You think I would sleep with that woman?	2	8
You can't help yourself.	2	8
Admit it.	2	8
There's nothing to admit.	2	8
You're lying.	2	8
I'm going to bed.	2	8
Good morning.	2	8
Good morning, Daddy.	2	8
Mommy said the party was fun.	2	8
Did she?	2	8
Okay.	2	8
Bye-bye.	2	8
Bye-bye.	2	8
Bye, Daddy.	2	8
Aren't you going to be a daddy soon?	2	8
I've done my part. The rest is up to her.	2	8
Don't pay attention to that due date.	2	8
It'll drive you nuts.	2	8
- D Day. - Hello.	2	8
This is Mr. Pastern and Mr. Kostis from Maytag.	2	8
- Are we all better now? - Yes.	2	8
Process seems to be streamlined.	2	8
Wait a minute. Is she the one we spoke to on the phone?	2	8
Yes. Joan is handling Broadcast Operations.	2	8
I had no idea.	2	8
I would have combed my hair before I called you.	2	8
I've got next week's scripts.	2	8
Don't hold anything back now.	2	8
She won't.	2	8
Well, it was nice to meet both of you in person.	2	8
Indeed.	2	8
Hell of an operation you've got here, Crane.	2	8
I think so.	2	8
Gentlemen.	2	8
Phil. Good to see you, as always.	2	8
Francis. Can we get you something?	2	8
We've got a fridge full of Heineken out there.	2	8
No. It's 11 a.m., for Pete's sake.	2	8
Well, thanks for coming by.	2	8
We were just so excited,	2	8
I thought you should hear it from the horse's mouth.	2	8
What exactly happened?	2	8
Well...	2	8
We explained to you before that research shows	2	8
that with the rise in commuters	2	8
and the relative scarcity of suburban bars,	2	8
people are drinking more in the home.	2	8
Yes, we heard you.	2	8
Entertaining housewives, etcetera.	2	8
We're not against it.	2	8
We just think our money would be spent better elsewhere.	2	8
And honestly, I agree with you,	2	8
but, well, we ran a little test,	2	8
and the results were very enlightening.	2	8
Don?	2	8
We targeted a few wealthy suburban markets	2	8
with woman-friendly end-aisle displays.	2	8
Was there a spike?	2	8
The sample was very small,	2	8
but what we put out sold well.	2	8
More important was who it sold to.	2	8
This is an untapped market where you dictate the competition.	2	8
I think I can say this because Don's being modest.	2	8
Don's wife, she's a peach of a girl.	2	8
They had a dinner party.	2	8
We're talking days after placement,	2	8
and she had this elaborate, elegant setup...	2	8
foods from around the globe.	2	8
And sure enough, there was your Heineken,	2	8
right next to the bone china and the polished sterling.	2	8
It was incredible.	2	8
Not exactly scientific.	2	8
Although it sounds like you do know your wife.	2	8
She's exactly who we're after...	2	8
well-off, educated, with plenty of time to shop.	2	8
And it's important for her	2	8
that she's the perfect hostess, the perfect wife.	2	8
We even talked about using her menu verbatim	2	8
in selected ladies' magazines.	2	8
Really?	2	8
We haven't been there yet.	2	8
No, but it's what I've been pushing for.	2	8
And so I take your word on this?	2	8
Why would I lie?	2	8
We're the ones who are going to have to deliver.	2	8
I guess we could throw it in the mix.	2	8
Let's start regional.	2	8
See how some strangers' wives feel.	2	8
I would recommend buying air time during Love of Life.	2	8
Women watching TV during the day	2	8
like to fantasize about having active lifestyles.	2	8
They like where they could be going with Sea & Ski.	2	8
And they watch every day.	2	8
I know my daughter missed a lot of classes in college	2	8
for her stories.	2	8
My wife brought the TV home.	2	8
There you go.	2	8
Mr. Hansen, I don't know how Mr. Crane feels about this,	2	8
but I've been reading the scripts,	2	8
and I just have to say	2	8
As the World Turns is about to become unmissable.	2	8
I don't want to give it away,	2	8
but someone people think is dead is not.	2	8
I'm glad you like it, but they all do the same things, don't they?	2	8
No. Not at all.	2	8
This is what they call a special summer storyline,	2	8
and I've spoken to Logan Reynolds over at CBS,	2	8
and it's going to receive a lot of promotion.	2	8
Is it the same price?	2	8
Well, they're all close.	2	8
This sounds better.	2	8
Well, if you lock them in at this rating and then they exceed it,	2	8
there's a bang for your buck factor, isn't there?	2	8
I would say so.	2	8
Then you should do that.	2	8
I think you'll be pleased.	2	8
That's why I didn't want to do this on the phone.	2	8
I love what she says, and I love the way she says it.	2	8
Let me walk you out.	2	8
Are you okay, Mommy?	2	8
I'm okay, sweetheart.	2	8
I'm just not feeling very well.	2	8
Do you want some aspirin?	2	8
No, Sally.	2	8
I'm just going to rest a little bit, okay?	2	8
Go play with your brother.	2	8
Okay.	2	8
Shit.	2	8
Crane, thanks for squeezing me in.	2	8
You said 4:30.	2	8
Hell, is it only 4:30?	2	8
Sorry about that.	2	8
Listen, I'll be brief,	2	8
since it appears I'm on my way out.	2	8
I've received a lot of unsolicited phone calls.	2	8
Simply put, the customers are satisfied,	2	8
and so is the accounting department.	2	8
Keep up the good work.	2	8
Well, I'm not doing it on my own.	2	8
Right. That's true, isn't it?	2	8
Why don't we get those secretaries back to their regular jobs?	2	8
It's just Joan Holloway, actually.	2	8
So her attentions are divided at best.	2	8
Make it a full-time position, 150 a week, and he has to share an office.	2	8
Sounds perfect.	2	8
Hello.	2	8
Where are the kids?	2	8
Bed.	2	8
What happened here?	2	8
Nothing.	2	8
Nothing happened here.	2	8
I went through every pocket and every drawer,	2	8
and there's nothing.	2	8
Would you stop?	2	8
How much have you had to drink?	2	8
I don't even know why I bother looking.	2	8
All I found were stacks of cocktail napkins with stupid advertising on them.	2	8
What are you doing, Bets?	2	8
I would never do this to you.	2	8
How could you do this to me?	2	8
I didn't do anything.	2	8
Don.	2	8
What time is it?	2	8
I don't want it to be like this.	2	8
Me, either.	2	8
I don't know what to do.	2	8
Don't.	2	8
Nothing happened.	2	8
Now you look me in the eye.	2	8
You never do that.	2	8
Yes, I do.	2	8
You never say you love me.	2	8
Yes, I do.	2	8
You know I do.	2	8
I say it all the time.	2	8
No, you don't.	2	8
Do you hate me?	2	8
God, no.	2	8
I love you, Bets.	2	8
I do.	2	8
And I love the children.	2	8
I don't want to lose all this.	2	8
This is a very impressive operation.	2	8
It's Madison Avenue.	2	8
Look at this.	2	8
Did we get Miracle Whip?	2	8
I don't know.	2	8
Makes a lot of sense.	2	8
She's an undercover nun.	2	8
So, Turk doesn't know which way to turn,	2	8
he's so drunk, so finally he stops.	2	8
We get out of the car,	2	8
"and the sign says ""Bridge Cut. """	2	8
- Hello, Joan. - You wanted to see me?	2	8
Joan, this is Danny Lindstrom.	2	8
Dan.	2	8
He's going to be in charge of Broadcast Operations.	2	8
Excuse me?	2	8
I've really appreciated you filling in.	2	8
I couldn't have asked for more.	2	8
Joan knows everything about this.	2	8
Well, that makes one of us.	2	8
I've already given him next week's scripts.	2	8
It would be great if you could fill him in on how it works.	2	8
Right now?	2	8
Why not? Are you busy?	2	8
No. Not at all.	2	8
It's really just reading the scripts, all of them,	2	8
and looking through the storylines	2	8
to see if there's any...	2	8
possible benefits to our clients,	2	8
how their products may be portrayed to their advantage,	2	8
and, of course, getting the cooperation of the networks.	2	8
That's pretty much what I said.	2	8
Not exactly.	2	8
Listen, you're going to be around to help with the details, right?	2	8
Yes, of course.	2	8
Anything else?	2	8
No, Joan. And thank you again.	2	8
This is wonderful. It's completely automatic.	2	8
I just leave it.	2	8
If you set the number.	2	8
You know, don't think we don't know	2	8
how lucky we are having you do this for us.	2	8
Thank you. It's nice to be included.	2	8
Peggy, do you have something you need to talk about?	2	8
Excuse me?	2	8
Well, I've noticed that you don't take Communion.	2	8
And I don't think it's too much of a leap	2	8
to ask if there's something you need to talk about.	2	8
No.	2	8
God already knows whatever it is, Peggy.	2	8
Well, then I don't need to talk.	2	8
Well, I'm here right now.	2	8
Father, don't take this the wrong way,	2	8
but I don't think you'd understand.	2	8
God is bigger than what we were raised on.	2	8
Father, you don't have to live life like the rest of us.	2	8
Maybe you're lucky.	2	8
I've lived life.	2	8
I wasn't born a priest.	2	8
Of course not.	2	8
You know, when you distance yourself from the church,	2	8
you are distancing yourself from everything.	2	8
That's why it's called Communion, you know.	2	8
It's not just being with God.	2	8
It's being with people.	2	8
I know that.	2	8
Well, then, why are you pushing everyone away?	2	8
I'm not.	2	8
There is no sin too great to bring to God.	2	8
You can reconcile yourself with him and have a whole new start.	2	8
You're a smart, beautiful young girl.	2	8
You have so much to offer.	2	8
Do you feel you don't deserve his love?	2	8
Your copies are done.	2	8
I'll put them in a box for you.	2	8
There you go.	2	8
Thank you very much, Peggy.	2	8
I'll see you on Sunday?	2	8
Yes, of course.	2	8
Welcome to the club.	2	8
So I pulled Sylvia's hair and treated her mean.	2	8
She ran after me all the time,	2	8
and every day she took me down to the malt shop	2	8
to split a soda with her.	2	8
And just like that, I lose her.	2	8
How do you know you lost her?	2	8
Today I walked into the malt shop,	2	8
and there was another guy at the end of my straw.	2	8
Imagine my horror when a night on the town turned ugly.	2	8
This is a nice place for nice people.	2	8
And the jerk behind the bar, he throws a bowl of nuts at me.	2	8
What am I, a squirrel?	2	8
Lucky for him,	2	8
I carry my own wherever I go.	2	8
Am I crazy? I don't think so.	2	8
Just you try and stick your face into a can of nuts.	2	8
Take it from a nut.	2	8
Utz are better than nuts.	2	8
We have chains in almost every suburban market	2	8
on the East Coast, plus Chicago, Cleveland.	2	8
It's a vote of confidence.	2	8
Mrs. Draper is on the line.	2	8
I got to take this.	2	8
Thank her again for me.	2	8
Hello.	2	8
Don't come home.	2	8
What?	2	8
I don't care what you do.	2	8
I just don't want you here.	2	8
- Betty. - Don, I don't want to see you.	2	8
Well, early in the morning	2	8
About the break of day	2	8
I asked the Lord	2	8
Help me find the way	2	8
Help me find the way	2	8
To the Promised Land	2	8
This lonely body needs a helping hand	2	8
I asked the Lord to help me, please	2	8
Find the way	2	8
When a new day's a-dawning	2	8
I bow my head in prayer	2	8
I pray to the Lord	2	8
Won't you lead me there?	2	8
Won't you guide me safely to the golden stair?	2	8
Won't you let this body Your burden share?	2	8
I pray to the Lord	2	8
Won't you lead me, please?	2	8
Lead me there	2	8

Kids, time to go!	2	9
Coming, Carla.	2	9
And I said I liked her name.	2	9
Cocoa's a nice name. Isn't it?	2	9
Yes. It is.	2	9
Come on, Bobby. Let's go.	2	9
All right. Let's go.	2	9
Good morning.	2	9
- Peggy. - Good morning, Don.	2	9
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	2	9
Hollis.	2	9
 You hear about Marilyn? Poor thing.	2	9
It's very upsetting.	2	9
I can't say I'm surprised.	2	9
The few things I know about her.	2	9
You just don't imagine her ever being alone.	2	9
She was so famous.	2	9
Some people just hide in plain sight.	2	9
My mother and sister keep calling.	2	9
Suicide is disturbing.	2	9
I keep thinking about Joe DiMaggio.	2	9
We're lucky Playtex didn't go for that Jackie/Marilyn campaign.	2	9
We'd have to pull everything indefinitely.	2	9
Yes, that's true.	2	9
I've never taken pills, even when I had a headache.	2	9
 Mr. Draper, good morning.	2	9
Would you like coffee?	2	9
I already had some.	2	9
They're waiting for you in the conference room.	2	9
Do you need to go home?	2	9
No. Of course not.	2	9
I have Warren, and I have Todd.	2	9
Todd is a mail boy. Why do you have him?	2	9
I'm paying him.	2	9
I'm sorry. I don't understand this stupid blood drive.	2	9
You just hate that Media wins every year.	2	9
Wins what? How do you win a blood drive? What do you win?	2	9
I don't know. You're the best or something.	2	9
I'll be lucky if Accounts can get eight people.	2	9
Well, Campbell's afraid of needles,	2	9
Duck doesn't give two craps.	2	9
Good morning.	2	9
Good morning, fellas.	2	9
Is this program already in progress?	2	9
We're expecting our most successful blood drive ever.	2	9
Yes. Tell me everything.	2	9
I think we're very organized.	2	9
Creative, our department,	2	9
will be at 75 to 80% participation.	2	9
Of course, I'm assuming you are in.	2	9
I am.	2	9
Do Kurt and Smitty count as one person?	2	9
Why don't you bore me with the details?	2	9
We're gonna take the lockers out of the break room,	2	9
put 'em in the hallway in the morning.	2	9
There will be two litters, three nurses,	2	9
at least one old lady serving refreshments, and pIenty of chairs.	2	9
Kinsey, I want you to pull every intern and Iackey--	2	9
switchboard, elevator men.	2	9
Find out who wants to be a copywriter for the day.	2	9
DoIlar a head.	2	9
That's not fair.	2	9
You're in Accounts. You should have thought of it.	2	9
Just to be clear,	2	9
do I get the dollar for each person I get,	2	9
or do they get it for giving blood?	2	9
The people giving blood.	2	9
This is for mankind, Kinsey.	2	9
That's the money they'd make actually being in the art department.	2	9
So what is the prize?	2	9
Helping another human being.	2	9
Also, there will be women fainting.	2	9
I'd think you'd like that.	2	9
If this was a flat-out athletic competition,	2	9
Accounts would win, without a doubt.	2	9
What an elegant surrender.	2	9
And put up more posters.	2	9
I can't believe I have to say that to you people.	2	9
Apparently, if we get 1 00% participation,	2	9
which Media will do its best to aid,	2	9
they're going to put us in the Times.	2	9
I booked a photographer, just in case.	2	9
Good.	2	9
NBC's having the Mitch Miller concert on Thursday.	2	9
Any chance I could show you and Mrs. Draper off?	2	9
We'd love to, but--	2	9
. . .my kid is sick.	2	9
You'll know what that means soon enough.	2	9
Shot down.	2	9
That was quick.	2	9
What do we have today?	2	9
The 1 0:00 with Miss Holloway to go over traffic for new business,	2	9
4:00 with Ron Venincasa from Ace Hardware,	2	9
and Mr. Sterling moved the meeting with Boston Edison to 5.	2	9
I assume to have it bleed into the cocktail hour.	2	9
May I?	2	9
There was a bit of confusion last night.	2	9
I think I made a terrible mistake.	2	9
What happened?	2	9
Your daughter called and asked	2	9
when you would be back from your business trip	2	9
because her mother wasn't sure.	2	9
You don't have to tell me anything, but I didn't know what to say.	2	9
I said Wednesday. I know I should have said I don't know.	2	9
Mrs. Draper is working out some things.	2	9
I understand.	2	9
I'm sure it won't come up again.	2	9
I thought it would be over by now,	2	9
I guess, and there'd be no need to--	2	9
I'm sorry about that.	2	9
It goes without saying that this is personal,	2	9
and I'd appreciate your keeping it that way.	2	9
Of course.	2	9
I'd also avoid giving me concerned looks.	2	9
Mr. Draper, I hope you've noticed I'm a discreet person.	2	9
I don't know you at all,	2	9
and this is personal,	2	9
and it's not up for discussion.	2	9
Of course.	2	9
If you need anything, I'm right out there.	2	9
I'm at the Roosevelt if there's an emergency.	2	9
In an interview just weeks before her death,	2	9
Miss Monroe angrily protested to a reporter	2	9
about attacks on stars.	2	9
"""We're what's okay with the movie business,"" she said."	2	9
"""Management is what's wrong with the business."""	2	9
Mr. Campbell, Miss Olson, and Mr. Romano are here.	2	9
Send them in.	2	9
My oldest just turned 30,	2	9
and she's had a string of bad beaux.	2	9
It's very upsetting.	2	9
Can I get you kids anything?	2	9
- I'm fine. - I'll have something.	2	9
They're probably walking over.	2	9
Dress rehearsal, Freddie.	2	9
I'll do introductions.	2	9
Jeff Hartung's wife just had a baby.	2	9
Boy or girl?	2	9
That's good.	2	9
Then I talk about Volkswagen.	2	9
No. Don said we only bring up Volkswagen	2	9
if they don't like what we've presented.	2	9
Okay. Then I throw it to you, Freddie.	2	9
Thank you, Freddie.	2	9
"""I just got a brand-new Samsonite Silhouette,"	2	9
"""and I hate it."	2	9
"""Don't get me wrong."	2	9
"""I love the shape, the size, the color,"	2	9
"""and I love the Silhouette because it's a Samsonite,"	2	9
"so I know we're gonna go lots of places together,"""	2	9
see lots of things,	2	9
collect a lifetime of memories.	2	9
I hate my Silhouette because it's empty.	2	9
Then Sal.	2	9
Shouldn't the artwork come first?	2	9
What about unveiIing it?	2	9
You know how excited they get.	2	9
Freddie?	2	9
What the hell, Freddie?	2	9
What--	2	9
What were we talking about?	2	9
Two types of travelers.	2	9
Freddie, do you have another pair of trousers here?	2	9
Why?	2	9
Jesus.	2	9
I'll fix this.	2	9
I'm gonna-- I need a minute.	2	9
I gotta think.	2	9
Freddie?	2	9
Is he dead?	2	9
No, he's not dead. He passed out.	2	9
He's fine.	2	9
The Hartungs are at reception.	2	9
We'll be right there. Thanks, Abigail.	2	9
He can't leave this room.	2	9
They're all from Colorado.	2	9
I guess I could push it until tomorrow,	2	9
book them another night at the Carlyle.	2	9
Should I just cancel it?	2	9
I should talk to Don.	2	9
That's not necessary. I can handle this.	2	9
Fine.	2	9
Jesus. It's a suitcase.	2	9
Peggy, you can do it, right?	2	9
You think it's gonna be better tomorrow?	2	9
Shit.	2	9
It'll be fine.	2	9
We'll tell them Freddie's sick. It's true.	2	9
I'll go to reception. You two go to the conference room	2	9
and act like you've been waiting, but don't look mad.	2	9
Someone telI Freddie's girl it's cancelled.	2	9
I don't want him wandering in.	2	9
It's disgusting.	2	9
There's no need for that.	2	9
Can I speak to you for a minute?	2	9
Carla?	2	9
I forgot you were coming by.	2	9
Are you okay?	2	9
I haven't been feeling weIl.	2	9
Oh, no, Betty.	2	9
You and Don are still coming tonight, l hope.	2	9
We'd love to.	2	9
I just don't think I'Il be up to it.	2	9
That ruins things.	2	9
Well, you wanted to borrow the black chiffon, right?	2	9
Come upstairs.	2	9
Are you sure?	2	9
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to.	2	9
Raymond has to work these things.	2	9
And I got you out of bed? I am so sorry.	2	9
Give me the black one, and I'll go.	2	9
Nonsense.	2	9
I think my waist is higher than yours.	2	9
What do you have that's generous?	2	9
I don't know.	2	9
How about this?	2	9
You'll look like sherbet. Long white gloves.	2	9
I can't wear those after Gypsy.	2	9
Think you'll be better by lunch on Thursday?	2	9
I'm looking forward to it.	2	9
This is youthful.	2	9
It doesn't matter. I'm invisible.	2	9
That's not true.	2	9
Raymond's sweet about it, but he's so easy to please.	2	9
That's sweet.	2	9
It is.	2	9
I think, what did I do to deserve him?	2	9
Then I spend his money on Dr. Weinberg.	2	9
I got my diagnosis the other day.	2	9
I'm bored .	2	9
That's too bad.	2	9
I saw Arthur have a fight with Tara,	2	9
and I have been having ridiculous dreams since.	2	9
I wish you'd come ride with us again.	2	9
It reaIly takes the pressure off.	2	9
Think you can carry this?	2	9
No, ma'am.	2	9
You shouldn't talk to him so much.	2	9
I know. It's embarrassing.	2	9
It's a switch you can flip on and off, you know.	2	9
Really?	2	9
You don't even think about this, do you?	2	9
Don's perfect.	2	9
Can we talk at lunch?	2	9
I'm really not feeling well.	2	9
Take them all.	2	9
No. Just these two.	2	9
That's it for today.	2	9
Many's the time I've dreamed of finding you like this.	2	9
What are you doing here?	2	9
You're right.	2	9
I'll just get all my beIongings,	2	9
- and I'lI leave. - It's 4:30.	2	9
You're supposed to be sitting in a bar somewhere	2	9
waiting for Boston Edison.	2	9
How often do you come in here?	2	9
Not that often.	2	9
What's wrong, Red?	2	9
Do you miss me?	2	9
She was so young.	2	9
Not you, too.	2	9
Yes, I'm just another frivolous secretary.	2	9
It's a terrible tragedy,	2	9
but that woman's a stranger.	2	9
Roosevelt--	2	9
I hated him, but I felt like I knew him.	2	9
A lot of peopIe felt like they knew her.	2	9
You should be sensitive to that.	2	9
Hey. You're not like her.	2	9
Physically, a little,	2	9
but don't tell me that makes you sad.	2	9
It's not a joke.	2	9
This worId destroyed her.	2	9
ReaIly? She was a movie star who had everything and everybody,	2	9
and she threw it away.	2	9
But, hey, if you want to be sad.	2	9
One day you'll lose someone who's important to you.	2	9
You'll see.	2	9
It's very painful.	2	9
Are you feeling better, Mommy?	2	9
Yes. I'll join you next time.	2	9
I'm surprised Daddy let you in the car.	2	9
You kids should go to bed .	2	9
Wash your face and brush your teeth. I'll tuck you in.	2	9
Good night.	2	9
You just came back.	2	9
Now you're leaving again?	2	9
It'll go by like that.	2	9
Come here.	2	9
It won't be that long, Salamander.	2	9
Go.	2	9
Listen, she called my office.	2	9
She did? When?	2	9
Monday.	2	9
What do you want me to say?	2	9
I think she expected you over the weekend.	2	9
You said you didn't want me here, and then you do.	2	9
I didn't want them involved in this.	2	9
Obviously, that's impossible.	2	9
What do you want to do?	2	9
I mean, how Iong is this going to go on?	2	9
We have to tell them something.	2	9
Like what?	2	9
Okay. How about. . .	2	9
I'm working on an account.	2	9
They're putting me up in Philadelphia,	2	9
but I'lI be home every weekend.	2	9
Jesus. Did you just think that up?	2	9
Or I could just come home.	2	9
Bets, what do you want?	2	9
Listen, if your mind's made up,	2	9
I'm not gonna taIk you into it.	2	9
I thought you can talk anyone into anything.	2	9
Good night.	2	9
Would you like coffee?	2	9
And a bear claw.	2	9
What's this?	2	9
I thought you could use a few more shirts in your rotation.	2	9
Thank you. Submit your receipt.	2	9
Your correspondence is on your desk.	2	9
Let me get you breakfast. I'lI be right back.	2	9
And Mr. Kinsey said that l have to drag you,	2	9
if necessary, to the blood drive.	2	9
You're not a fainter, are you?	2	9
I don't faint, but I might cry after.	2	9
Peggy.	2	9
Hello, Freddie.	2	9
How'd it go yesterday?	2	9
I Ieft word with Abigail. They loved it.	2	9
Good. Good.	2	9
I was thinking about letting you talk anyway.	2	9
I have to apologize for putting you in that spot.	2	9
Freddie, it's over.	2	9
There's no reason to talk about it.	2	9
Of course.	2	9
Did they ask about me?	2	9
We told them you were sick.	2	9
That's good.	2	9
So on Monday, when they get back to Colorado,	2	9
I'll give them a caIl and sew things up.	2	9
That's a great idea.	2	9
Bobby.	2	9
Mrs. Draper. I'm sorry to bother you.	2	9
It's okay, Carla.	2	9
It's a beautiful day.	2	9
I'm going to take the children out again. ls that good?	2	9
Whatever they want.	2	9
Can I do anything for you?	2	9
If you want, I can draw a bath.	2	9
No, thank you.	2	9
I've been married almost 20 years, you know.	2	9
I really don't want to talk about this.	2	9
I'm sorry.	2	9
Carla. . . .	2	9
I haven't been sleeping very well.	2	9
You know what helps?	2	9
Splash cold water on your face and go outside.	2	9
You'lI notice things are right where you left them.	2	9
I'm usually part of the meeting before the meeting.	2	9
Relax, Don. Sit down.	2	9
This is all being done in the right way.	2	9
Campbell.	2	9
Well, Don, I'm afraid we have some bad news.	2	9
We were on the launch pad yesterday for Samsonite,	2	9
and Freddie Rumsen pissed his pants.	2	9
What?	2	9
He's not talking about nerves here.	2	9
He's taIking about a wet pair of pants.	2	9
Really?	2	9
How'd the presentation go?	2	9
Don, it's conduct unbefitting.	2	9
Of Freddie Rumsen?	2	9
We're lucky Campbell here grabbed the controls.	2	9
He locked Rumsen up and threw Peggy OIson in.	2	9
We're lucky the bench is deep.	2	9
We have to cut him loose.	2	9
Is that necessary?	2	9
The man is a train wreck.	2	9
We at least need to get him off this account.	2	9
They called already. They're thrilled with Peggy.	2	9
No. I don't want him on any of my accounts.	2	9
This could have happened in a meeting.	2	9
But it didn't.	2	9
That'll be all, boys.	2	9
Thank you for bringing this to our attention.	2	9
We're not doing him any favors keeping him around.	2	9
Duck's a teetotaler.	2	9
He's been gunning for Freddie since day 1 .	2	9
He's got a point.	2	9
We can't even tell Cooper about this.	2	9
You know his whole thing with germs.	2	9
I don't think it's in my contract	2	9
that Duck can fire someone in my department.	2	9
You don't have a contract.	2	9
And I can fire anyone I want to.	2	9
We really don't have a choice.	2	9
You can still get him to give blood.	2	9
The agencies will laugh about this,	2	9
but the clients, they already think we're all like that.	2	9
We'll say it's a six-month leave of absence so he can go for the cure.	2	9
He'll know what that means.	2	9
You don't want to throw him away.	2	9
Your loyalty is starting to become a Iiability.	2	9
Let's do this before he finds out.	2	9
We don't need any more accidents.	2	9
Dinner tonight.	2	9
You need to call the missus?	2	9
I'll make it.	2	9
Mr. Case.	2	9
Betty.	2	9
How are you?	2	9
It's a beautiful day.	2	9
Have you just ridden, or are you about to ride?	2	9
I can never tell whether you're before or after.	2	9
I'm on my way out.	2	9
It's good to see you.	2	9
How are your children?	2	9
They're wonderful.	2	9
Have you seen Sara Beth lately?	2	9
I think so. Monday, maybe?	2	9
That's good news.	2	9
I'm glad she came.	2	9
Why?	2	9
Nothing.	2	9
I had noticed she seemed distracted.	2	9
I shouldn't have said anything.	2	9
Is there anything I can do?	2	9
No. But she'd be glad to know you're concerned.	2	9
I think you make her feel better.	2	9
She talks about you a lot.	2	9
I didn't mean to embarrass you.	2	9
You know what?	2	9
The three of us should go to lunch and have some fun.	2	9
It would cheer her up.	2	9
It's a great idea.	2	9
Thursday?	2	9
Café Soleil in Old Town.	2	9
1 :00.	2	9
I'll pick up the check.	2	9
See you then.	2	9
That was nothing.	2	9
I'm thinking of doing it again.	2	9
You should smoke a cigarette right now.	2	9
I know they said not to,	2	9
but I'm telling you, my knees buckled.	2	9
I thought I was gonna perform a full Freddie Rumsen.	2	9
Jesus.	2	9
Hello, Don. We're in the lead.	2	9
Turns out Hollis has a novel.	2	9
Good.	2	9
Too bad Freddie made his donation yesterday.	2	9
He's a real wizz in advertising.	2	9
Jesus.	2	9
What are you doing?	2	9
What do you mean?	2	9
That's none of your business.	2	9
Freddie had a bad day.	2	9
Can't you find something else to do	2	9
besides dining on the drama of other people's lives	2	9
like a bunch of teenage girls?	2	9
Sorry, Don. It's funny.	2	9
Sure.	2	9
It's just a man's name, right?	2	9
Could you leave us alone for a moment?	2	9
Truth to tell, I was a little nervous.	2	9
I'd never given one of those funny speeches before	2	9
where you say what you don't mean.	2	9
Freddie, we've reached a decision.	2	9
You're gonna take a six-month leave of absence.	2	9
Is that necessary?	2	9
The door wiIl be open.	2	9
It was a snafu.	2	9
Isn't the embarrassment enough?	2	9
Full salary. You dry out, come back,	2	9
we'll see where we are.	2	9
Clients love me. I keep up with them.	2	9
We have laughs.	2	9
Monday morning, I'll be good as new.	2	9
I promise.	2	9
There's a line, Freddie,	2	9
and you wet it.	2	9
You see? We're laughing about it.	2	9
What's the big deal?	2	9
You remember Bob Peebles? How mean he was?	2	9
He fired his secretary,	2	9
and he threw all her things out the window,	2	9
including her keys.	2	9
That was good for morale.	2	9
What is this about?	2	9
Duck PhiIlips?	2	9
He's as dry as a bone.	2	9
He doesn't understand this business.	2	9
Freddie, my father would have fired you for this.	2	9
Your father drank more than the two of you put together.	2	9
He used to come in with his shirt on inside-out.	2	9
He admired you.	2	9
I , however, had different feelings at the time.	2	9
When we first met,	2	9
Bonny Prince Sterling here thought I was a coward	2	9
because I was in the Signal Corps.	2	9
I didn't know it was only for his last six months.	2	9
I thought he was a typist.	2	9
Turns out before that,	2	9
he was in charge of killing people--	2	9
and by people, I mean Germans.	2	9
It was a long time ago.	2	9
Come on. Be proud.	2	9
What was it? Like 1 5 of them.	2	9
That's impressive.	2	9
Look, l can be completely in control.	2	9
My podiatrist went to Hazleton.	2	9
Came back a new man with great stories.	2	9
Only drinks beer now.	2	9
It's the best thing, Freddie.	2	9
Well, I guess you get dealt the hand you get dealt, right?	2	9
I can pull myself together.	2	9
I got a great book.	2	9
Maybe l'll head to PhilIy or Boston.	2	9
They're all dying to do what we do here.	2	9
You know l'll recommend you.	2	9
Fantastic. So this couId be good.	2	9
There's a lot of great towns.	2	9
My father sold greeting cards.	2	9
He used to come into the kitchen,	2	9
unroll this map on the table,	2	9
and put a finger on a spot and say something like,	2	9
"""Memphis. Who wants to live in Memphis?"""	2	9
"I'd say, ""Not me."""	2	9
We had only been in Springfield for nine months.	2	9
Meanwhile, here we are.	2	9
To New York.	2	9
Come on. Let's make a night of it.	2	9
Really?	2	9
AbsoluteIy.	2	9
To Monday morning.	2	9
It'll be here faster than you think.	2	9
Hold off on the menus.	2	9
We're going to take another lap first.	2	9
Bring some bread.	2	9
Give me 5 bucks.	2	9
No. Sorry. Don.	2	9
Can I help you gentlemen?	2	9
Swordfish.	2	9
And who are you here to see?	2	9
You can't do that now.	2	9
I just gave you the money.	2	9
Come on. Do we look like cops?	2	9
Sir?	2	9
I have a very good friend--	2	9
I can't remember the guy's name.	2	9
How about if I give you our names?	2	9
I'm Dick Dollars,	2	9
this is Mike Moneybags,	2	9
and this--	2	9
Tilden Katz.	2	9
Fine.	2	9
Here.	2	9
That's a 20.	2	9
Gentlemen.	2	9
Is it Milwaukee?	2	9
Yes, it is.	2	9
Son of a bitch.	2	9
The Chuck-a-luck.	2	9
Going to need some cocktails.	2	9
Hey, isn't that the champ back there?	2	9
For another couple of months.	2	9
You're crazy.	2	9
Nobody's gonna beat him.	2	9
Hey, loosen up.	2	9
Everything's gonna be okay.	2	9
Just in time.	2	9
Canadian Club neat, Wolfschmidt Gibson,	2	9
Granddad rocks.	2	9
Pete Campbell.	2	9
I would have never thought I was in his way.	2	9
You know, you bet badly.	2	9
Obviously.	2	9
No. I mean you win a few times,	2	9
you got to start really putting it out there.	2	9
You kept betting the same thing.	2	9
You're so good at this, why don't you quit your job?	2	9
See? He's having a great time.	2	9
Hello, there.	2	9
Are we winners or losers?	2	9
Losers tonight, but winners in general.	2	9
You know, BBDO hired a colored kid.	2	9
What do you think of that?	2	9
I think I'm glad I'm not that kid.	2	9
I'm sorry. Can we get you a drink or something?	2	9
No.	2	9
I'm sorry. Were you interested?	2	9
No, I'm fine. Thank you.	2	9
I know what's going on.	2	9
You come in too early.	2	9
You got dry cleaning moving in and out.	2	9
I can't remember the Iast time it was	2	9
you went out spur of the moment.	2	9
Send off Freddie, I had to send off Freddie.	2	9
Come on.	2	9
I've been in your particular situation.	2	9
I heard you chaired the blood drive.	2	9
Where are you, the Stanhope?	2	9
The Biltmore?	2	9
- Roger. - Did she kick you out? You leave?	2	9
There's nothing to talk about.	2	9
Look, people make mistakes.	2	9
You feel bad about it. You think things over,	2	9
and in the end, you do the grand gesture for her.	2	9
It'll be easy for you . You're creative.	2	9
Roger, will you stop?	2	9
All I'm gonna say is do you want to be right,	2	9
or do you want to be married?	2	9
I know marriage isn't a natural state, but you do it.	2	9
Why?	2	9
I don't know.	2	9
The kids.	2	9
Again!	2	9
And don't fool yourself. There are other things.	2	9
Think about when you met her.	2	9
Okay. I'm sorry.	2	9
You're so secretive.	2	9
Hey, Don.	2	9
Look who's here.	2	9
If it isn't the man in the gray flannel suit.	2	9
What the hell was that for?	2	9
We're gonna go.	2	9
Don't worry about it.	2	9
I'm sure it's not the first time he's been punched in the face.	2	9
Hey, Floyd.	2	9
How'd I do?	2	9
I'm sure there are 20 people who want to thank you for that.	2	9
It wasn't exactly a fair match-up.	2	9
I think that's gonna do it for me.	2	9
Yeah. Me, too.	2	9
It's getting late.	2	9
- This was a nice evening. - Hold on.	2	9
Don and I are going to the East Side. You take it.	2	9
AbsoluteIy.	2	9
l'd like to stay and get all sentimental with you,	2	9
but l got to go and give a Chinaman a music lesson.	2	9
Want to watch how I do it, unzipping the fly and everything?	2	9
Yeah. Go to heIl.	2	9
Take him to McCann.	2	9
This was fun.	2	9
Good.	2	9
I'm gonna miss you.	2	9
You're talented.	2	9
I don't know.	2	9
Thank you, Freddie.	2	9
It means a lot.	2	9
What am l gonna do?	2	9
What am l going to tell Violet?	2	9
I don't know. It sounded like you had a plan.	2	9
I'm not kidding, Don.	2	9
What am l gonna do?	2	9
It's not an ending.	2	9
It's a fresh start.	2	9
If I don't go into that office every day,	2	9
who am I?	2	9
Where do you live, Freddie?	2	9
1 52 Riverside Drive.	2	9
Apartment 604.	2	9
No matter what he says, take him there.	2	9
Good night, Freddie.	2	9
Good-bye, Don.	2	9
See, I find if I stick with the clear liquors--	2	9
vodka, gin-- I know where I stand.	2	9
I'm the opposite.	2	9
So what do you think, because you gave blood,	2	9
the whiskey made you a little angry?	2	9
That was a real Archibald Whitman maneuver.	2	9
Who's that?	2	9
This hothead drunk I used to know.	2	9
Jimmy Barrett's a weaseI. Enjoy.	2	9
So what's going on with you?	2	9
I'm at the Roosevelt.	2	9
See? That wasn't so hard.	2	9
I really don't want to discuss it, Roger.	2	9
Why? Because you feel so bad? l've been there.	2	9
No, I don't feel bad at all.	2	9
I mean, sometimes.	2	9
Mostly, I'm just relieved.	2	9
Really?	2	9
Did you falI in love?	2	9
No.	2	9
That'd be easier.	2	9
Then I'd know what to do.	2	9
Easier--	2	9
There's some incredible woman,	2	9
and someone's gonna end up with her, but it can't be you.	2	9
Why not?	2	9
'Cause we're married.	2	9
I don't know.	2	9
It's your life.	2	9
You don't know how long it's gonna be,	2	9
but you know it's got a bad ending.	2	9
You have to move forward.	2	9
As soon as you can figure out what that is.	2	9
Two coronaries.	2	9
Gotta move forward.	2	9
It's your life.	2	9
I mean, this can't be it, right?	2	9
We're in it together.	2	9
That's true.	2	9
You wanted to see me?	2	9
Close the door.	2	9
That was quite a presentation you gave.	2	9
The Samsonite people are thrilled.	2	9
That's good to hear.	2	9
They've requested that you be reassigned as the copywriter on their account.	2	9
What about Freddie?	2	9
Freddie's decided to take a few months off.	2	9
He did? When's he coming back?	2	9
It doesn't matter.	2	9
You'll be taking over all of his business.	2	9
Are you sure?	2	9
You know, I really don't like	2	9
walking into an ambush from Duck and Pete Campbell.	2	9
I don't know why anyone had to know about that.	2	9
Even me?	2	9
No, of course you,	2	9
but. . .	2	9
I just thought that--	2	9
I Iove Freddie.	2	9
What's your point?	2	9
Don't feel bad about being good at your job.	2	9
I wish it hadn't happened this way.	2	9
That's the way it happened.	2	9
Congratulations.	2	9
- Miss Olson-- - In a minute.	2	9
You couldn't keep your mouth shut.	2	9
Mr. Campbell.	2	9
Do you know what you did to Freddie Rumsen?	2	9
For just cause.	2	9
You didn't have to tell Don.	2	9
You told on Mr. Rumsen?	2	9
Do you mind?	2	9
It would have gotten out anyway.	2	9
Right, and he'd be some legend in one of those stupid stories.	2	9
Remember the guy who wet his pants before the big meeting?	2	9
Instead, he's finished.	2	9
Why do you feel bad for him?	2	9
Those people always blame their problems on society.	2	9
He did it to himself. Those people have no self-control.	2	9
lf it wasn't for him, I'd stilI be a secretary.	2	9
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be a junior copywriter.	2	9
I refuse to feel bad . We're going to get raises.	2	9
You could get his office.	2	9
Now, I'll go first.	2	9
Congratulations, Peggy.	2	9
Congratulations, Pete.	2	9
Good to see you.	2	9
This is me.	2	9
It's nice to see you.	2	9
What are you doing here?	2	9
Betty invited me for lunch,	2	9
but we're gonna need another place setting.	2	9
We're gonna be three.	2	9
Betty didn't say you'd be joining us.	2	9
I hope I'm not intruding.	2	9
She thought it'd be fun.	2	9
It will be.	2	9
It's just gotten infinitely more fun.	2	9
I think I need whatever you're having.	2	9
It's a gin and tonic.	2	9
Nothing speciaI.	2	9
It's perfect.	2	9
Keep stirring.	2	9
Bobby, go get two spoons.	2	9
So with Indian Point open now,	2	9
we should be able to use even a modest safety record.	2	9
We were spitballing about a cartoon turtle.	2	9
Kids. Keeps it friendly and nature-loving,	2	9
and then we just hammer the Ravenswood area	2	9
until they're ready for the next plant.	2	9
You on board with that?	2	9
Yes.	2	9
I want to see schedules,	2	9
and I want to see this turtle.	2	9
He doesn't want to be disturbed.	2	9
Hello, Don.	2	9
Hello, Mona. Jane, it's okay.	2	9
Just stop.	2	9
What?	2	9
I don't even know what to say to you.	2	9
About what?	2	9
Don't act innocent.	2	9
He's leaving me for his secretary.	2	9
Roger?	2	9
He's in love, and you said it was great.	2	9
Mona, I didn't say anything.	2	9
"""It's your life. You have to move forward."""	2	9
Mona, I didn't mean it that way.	2	9
25 years of marriage.	2	9
I want you to calm down.	2	9
Don't make me make a scene.	2	9
We should talk about this.	2	9
You can talk to Margaret.	2	9
Listen, Don, I can explain.	2	9
I want her off my desk.	2	9

 Do you know, if we stay in Beverly Hills,	2	10
even though the convention's in Santa Monica,	2	10
we'll be halfway to Pasadena.	2	10
Pasadena?	2	10
Isn't it just people with T. B?	2	10
Jet Propulsion Laboratories and Ray Bradbury.	2	10
As much as I'd like to indulge	2	10
your Twilight Zone fantasy of being shot into space...	2	10
Believe me, it's our fantasy, too.	2	10
This is a business trip.	2	10
I don't want either of you coming back tan.	2	10
What if I have to play golf?	2	10
As long as you lose.	2	10
Crab Colson guarantees there will be some astronauts there.	2	10
 Really? My nephews would love an autograph.	2	10
Astronauts love golf. I'll see what I can do.	2	10
You're there to sell, but you're also there to listen.	2	10
Every scientist, engineer, and general is trying	2	10
to figure out a way to put a man on the moon	2	10
or blow up Moscow, whichever one costs more.	2	10
We have to explain to them how we can help them spend that money.	2	10
Well, it certainly would behoove us to find out...	2	10
Campbell, you do the talking. Kinsey, you do the listening.	2	10
Don, you wanted me to remind them about the congressmen.	2	10
We know. They control the purse strings.	2	10
No. They are the customer.	2	10
They want aerospace in their districts.	2	10
Let them know that we can help them bring these contracts home.	2	10
Did you read anything that she prepared?	2	10
Maybe I should send her.	2	10
You know I'll stay out of your way.	2	10
Of course.	2	10
Lounging at the pool.	2	10
They'll think you're a young Barbara Stanwyck.	2	10
Doesn't that sound like fun?	2	10
If you're there, it will make me look less serious in the office.	2	10
Next time.	2	10
It's a week, Tweety.	2	10
I suppose I can go to my parents' place in Rehoboth.	2	10
Now you're making me feel bad.	2	10
Is that the only alternative?	2	10
They keep asking to spend time with me.	2	10
Well, us.	2	10
They're concerned.	2	10
About what?	2	10
Nothing's happening.	2	10
Why do you insist on making me angry before I go to bed?	2	10
There are some very reputable agencies.	2	10
We can't even talk about this?	2	10
Do I have to put my foot down?	2	10
What's wrong with it?	2	10
It's someone else's child.	2	10
Once you see a beautiful little baby, you'll fall in love.	2	10
You know you will.	2	10
It's not natural.	2	10
I felt that way.	2	10
But it changed.	2	10
We would have our pick.	2	10
We are ideal candidates.	2	10
We have means, and we've been to doctors,	2	10
so it's on the record that it's something we've been wanting for a long time.	2	10
Do your parents just think I say no to everything?	2	10
We're not related by blood, and you love me.	2	10
Hello.	2	10
It's me.	2	10
What time is it?	2	10
It's 10:00. Are you sleeping?	2	10
No.	2	10
William called.	2	10
My father had a stroke.	2	10
Jesus.	2	10
Three days ago.	2	10
Gloria didn't even call me. She had William call.	2	10
Is it bad?	2	10
She said he's up and around, talking,	2	10
but she wouldn't put him on the phone.	2	10
I'm coming to get you.	2	10
No.	2	10
Bets, it's not up for discussion.	2	10
Take the kids to Francine.	2	10
I don't want to wake them.	2	10
Fine.	2	10
I'll be by in the morning.	2	10
God.	2	10
You know, I've been dreaming about a suitcase?	2	10
Everything's gonna be okay.	2	10
Sure.	2	10
Everything's perfect.	2	10
I'll be by at 8.	2	10
Bye-bye.	2	10
Hello, Betty.	2	10
Hello, Gloria.	2	10
Hello, Don.	2	10
Look at the two of you.	2	10
I swear to you, the doctors say it's not serious.	2	10
We can get a room down the road at the William Penn.	2	10
Nonsense.	2	10
Where is he? Can I see him?	2	10
He's getting dressed.	2	10
They said he should do things on his own.	2	10
Come sit.	2	10
Don't do that.	2	10
We're supposed to keep it dim.	2	10
I don't know why.	2	10
Let me check on him.	2	10
William. I wasn't expecting you.	2	10
- Good morning. - Look who's here.	2	10
He doesn't seem that bad.	2	10
Don, good to see you.	2	10
Sorry about your dad.	2	10
We'll get by, right?	2	10
Judy's coming later.	2	10
She's dropping the girls off at her mother's.	2	10
Gloria, everything is copasetic.	2	10
It'll be nice to see her.	2	10
It's an angel.	2	10
Hi, Daddy.	2	10
That's what I needed.	2	10
Hello, Don.	2	10
Get that look off your face.	2	10
Good to see you, Gene.	2	10
I'll take a visit from you two any way I can get it.	2	10
Where are the munchkins?	2	10
With a neighbor.	2	10
Pop, did you see Don's car?	2	10
You finally step up to a Lincoln?	2	10
Coupe De Ville.	2	10
Ice-blue, white top.	2	10
Very nice.	2	10
How you feeling, Daddy?	2	10
It's a tempest in a teapot.	2	10
You should've seen her in the ambulance.	2	10
Well, we were halfway to the hospital before I noticed I was in my nightie.	2	10
A woman my age should not travel that way.	2	10
I wish you'd called earlier.	2	10
The other partners at Don's firm know all kinds of doctors.	2	10
In New York, right, where everything's better.	2	10
Always with her brow in a knit, my Ruthie here.	2	10
Ruthie, my love, have you offered everybody coffee?	2	10
I'm Betty.	2	10
Of course you are.	2	10
Gene, this is Betty, your daughter.	2	10
It's not Ruth. Ruth is dead.	2	10
Nobody wants coffee, Daddy.	2	10
Don, you were able to get off work?	2	10
I'm here.	2	10
- You want a drink? - I'll get some ice.	2	10
What did the doctors say?	2	10
It's just like last time.	2	10
What?	2	10
Last time? This happened before?	2	10
Don't get mad at her. It's a couple little strokes.	2	10
Runs in the family.	2	10
You know Gene.	2	10
Always has to be the one taking care of things.	2	10
So, Don, how did you come?	2	10
Did you take the Turnpike?	2	10
Yes.	2	10
Look at this. It's my lunch date.	2	10
Hello, baby. You're early.	2	10
You remember Ken and Pete?	2	10
Hello, Sheila.	2	10
Want to get in a few more meals before you lose him to the Golden West?	2	10
What are you talking about?	2	10
We're going to Los Angeles together.	2	10
It's horrible, but somebody has to go.	2	10
Where?	2	10
Californ-I-A.	2	10
Thank you, Pete.	2	10
Come on, Campbell.	2	10
Time to put something else in that mouth.	2	10
Nice to see you.	2	10
I was going to tell you at lunch.	2	10
Why are you going to Los Angeles?	2	10
Come on. Not here.	2	10
It just came up.	2	10
The election's not for months.	2	10
We can register voters in October.	2	10
It has nothing to do with the election.	2	10
You know that.	2	10
If you don't mind,	2	10
I'd rather face Mississippi and those people screaming at me	2	10
and maybe getting shot after I go to California.	2	10
Are you scared?	2	10
Don't pretend like it's not scary.	2	10
Look, I have to go.	2	10
Why? What is so important?	2	10
It's a convention.	2	10
I'm not allowed to talk about it.	2	10
Hello, Mr. Kinsey.	2	10
Please, Hollis. It's Paul.	2	10
This is Sheila, my girlfriend.	2	10
Nice to meet you.	2	10
Did you ever really plan on going down South?	2	10
How could you ask that?	2	10
This just came up.	2	10
You can always get another job at a grocery store.	2	10
I can't just walk into an ad agency.	2	10
I can't believe you.	2	10
All you do is complain about that place and those people.	2	10
That's not true.	2	10
Well, I'm going.	2	10
I guess I'll just hop in Billy Kaplan's bus with ten strangers.	2	10
Why can't it wait?	2	10
19th Street.	2	10
This was all supposed to be ours.	2	10
I keep thinking what would have happened if Dad had lived.	2	10
He'd be on his knees to us.	2	10
What about all that money Dad gave to Lincoln Center?	2	10
Get that back.	2	10
You can't take a donation back.	2	10
Listen, I'm as upset as you are.	2	10
We're about to finally buy in Millbrook.	2	10
How long can she afford to live?	2	10
By golly, Pete, maybe we can get rid of her tonight.	2	10
Remember Rope?	2	10
Well, look, all we have to do	2	10
is go over there, get her signature,	2	10
mourn over the loss of our birthright, and move on.	2	10
I hate going there.	2	10
The smell.	2	10
To the end of the line.	2	10
Does Judy want kids?	2	10
We have a five-year plan.	2	10
Although secretly I think Judy hopes	2	10
we're that childless couple people invite over.	2	10
Trudy?	2	10
We've tried.	2	10
That must be disappointing.	2	10
Adoption.	2	10
People do that.	2	10
They do.	2	10
So, the Yankees are having a hell of a year.	2	10
Do you take Bobby?	2	10
All the time.	2	10
We really thought you were going to make it to Cape May.	2	10
Although without Betty there, everyone had a turn at winning.	2	10
Elizabeth's got a mind for cards.	2	10
Where were you?	2	10
I was hiding in the tree house.	2	10
It's like a tomb in there.	2	10
I don't know how Don's standing it.	2	10
Is this the last picture of her in the house?	2	10
I don't know.	2	10
And where's the ottoman with the birds?	2	10
I don't know, Betty.	2	10
I mean, can you blame her?	2	10
I wouldn't want to live with Mom's ghost.	2	10
She's a silly woman.	2	10
All that talk about her underthings.	2	10
Daddy used to fine us for small talk, remember?	2	10
Conversation is an art.	2	10
Well, it is.	2	10
How long has he been like this?	2	10
He was acting queer on the golf course last month.	2	10
Let one of the colored caddies really have it.	2	10
Look, Gloria's helping us.	2	10
Okay? I don't want to get stuck with him	2	10
just because I cared enough not to move away.	2	10
Don works in Manhattan.	2	10
You know I wish I could be here.	2	10
You only have two kids.	2	10
Lord knows Don could afford to build him a house	2	10
in his backyard if he wanted to.	2	10
Stop counting other people's money.	2	10
And the jardini?re.	2	10
The what?	2	10
It used to be right there.	2	10
The ceramic thing?	2	10
I think we have that.	2	10
Do I have to go around and write my name on all the things that I want?	2	10
Bets, you're drunk.	2	10
Well, I hope everybody's hungry.	2	10
We're minutes away.	2	10
Why is that window open?	2	10
Well, look at that. You found a corner.	2	10
You're pulling your end.	2	10
Can't say the same about him.	2	10
Don's helping.	2	10
Who know what he does, why he does it?	2	10
I know more about the kid who fixes my damn car.	2	10
Dad, you're hurting Don's feelings.	2	10
It's okay.	2	10
Nobody has what you have.	2	10
You act like it's nothing.	2	10
My daughter's a princess. You know that?	2	10
Dinnertime.	2	10
What's going on?	2	10
He has no people!	2	10
You can't trust a person like that!	2	10
Daddy.	2	10
Fine. Let's go eat.	2	10
Come on.	2	10
I have no appetite.	2	10
Birdie, you should eat.	2	10
Stop it, Don.	2	10
Nobody's watching.	2	10
And here, Mother.	2	10
How many of these are there?	2	10
Hello, all.	2	10
I brought my pen. Hope I didn't miss anything.	2	10
Other than dinner, no.	2	10
Hello, Mother.	2	10
I think it's nice that even though you let Bud do all the work,	2	10
you found time to grace us with your signature.	2	10
Yes, well, anything I can do.	2	10
I just hope you don't get too used to this.	2	10
To what?	2	10
This family.	2	10
It has come to my attention that you and Trudy	2	10
are considering a child that's not your own.	2	10
Is this true?	2	10
It just came up.	2	10
How is that possible?	2	10
Peter, I would hate to have to exclude you	2	10
from what is rightfully yours.	2	10
You have to keep at it.	2	10
You know what, Mother?	2	10
This is not a topic of conversation.	2	10
I think you know how your father felt about the whole idea.	2	10
It's suitable for some.	2	10
But really, you're pulling from the discards.	2	10
My father?	2	10
- Yes. - Pete.	2	10
Your husband spent everything you had.	2	10
Spent it with strangers.	2	10
All of it.	2	10
What are you talking about?	2	10
I'll messenger these to your office tomorrow.	2	10
That's a swell idea.	2	10
The tone of your voice... I don't like it.	2	10
That, too?	2	10
Stop being dramatic.	2	10
Bud, what is my fiduciary state?	2	10
Tell her.	2	10
Well...	2	10
We had to liquidate your holdings to ensure your future comfort.	2	10
Why?	2	10
Who asked you to do that?	2	10
The market took a turn for the worse.	2	10
Real estate?	2	10
I think I would have heard about that.	2	10
Yes, well, don't forget to send those by my office.	2	10
Do you want me to lay everything out for you?	2	10
It's been a day. I just want to go to sleep.	2	10
You're smoking like a chimney.	2	10
It gives you wrinkles, you know.	2	10
Good morning, everyone.	2	10
Gene.	2	10
Morning, Don.	2	10
I have some batter left. Would you like some waffles?	2	10
No. This will be fine.	2	10
And coffee.	2	10
- Morning, everybody. - Do you want breaktast?	2	10
No.	2	10
I had no idea.	2	10
Please, Judy, it's okay.	2	10
No, it's yours. I feel terrible.	2	10
I didn't know your mother promised it to you.	2	10
Really, Judy, it's okay.	2	10
I wish he hadn't brought it up with you.	2	10
I'm putting it over here.	2	10
Isn't Viola coming today?	2	10
Later.	2	10
There's no chance she'll miss you.	2	10
- Leave the dishes. - Nonsense.	2	10
You look beautiful.	2	10
Thank you.	2	10
Now that you've fed me, why don't we go upstairs?	2	10
Gene!	2	10
I'm fine.	2	10
I don't know what to say. He's so mixed up.	2	10
Gene, you are mixed up.	2	10
You're mixed up.	2	10
He's tired. He didn't sleep last night.	2	10
Of course.	2	10
Dad, you have to go back to the doctor.	2	10
I already have an appointment for Monday.	2	10
So... Daddy, what would you like to do today?	2	10
Finish that puzzle?	2	10
Sure.	2	10
And maybe drive into town.	2	10
Get you a milkshake.	2	10
That's a grand idea.	2	10
Come in.	2	10
Finally.	2	10
I told her to call you.	2	10
You should have called me.	2	10
Hello, Viola.	2	10
And you two look good, considering.	2	10
How are the children?	2	10
They're good.	2	10
I'm gonna make some calls.	2	10
You should be here every day.	2	10
That's not up to me.	2	10
Why not? You've been here longer than her.	2	10
He needs you.	2	10
I don't know about that.	2	10
And you let Gloria and Judy ransack the house.	2	10
You want to give me your temper?	2	10
He doesn't know who I am.	2	10
He's very, very sick.	2	10
You don't know how nice it is to hear someone say that.	2	10
Is he dying?	2	10
I was at Elkins Park Hospital on Sunday when they talked to her.	2	10
It's just gonna get worse.	2	10
I don't know how much more I can take.	2	10
Well, this day comes eventually, like it or not.	2	10
I'm an orphan.	2	10
You are supposed to take care of your husband	2	10
and your beautiful children now.	2	10
They are yours.	2	10
You'll see.	2	10
The minute you leave, you'll remember him	2	10
exactly the way he used to be.	2	10
It's all good outside that door.	2	10
Want these upstairs?	2	10
No. I have to put it all in the wash.	2	10
I'll go get the kids.	2	10
Francine promised them the pool tomorrow.	2	10
Carla will bring them home later.	2	10
I'm gonna take a shower.	2	10
Don.	2	10
What?	2	10
I think you should leave.	2	10
Really?	2	10
Yes.	2	10
Bets, you're upset.	2	10
I am.	2	10
And I know how you feel about grieving.	2	10
I think I should be here for you.	2	10
That's your reason.	2	10
What do you want me to say?	2	10
I want to be here.	2	10
You need me here.	2	10
Why?	2	10
Nothing's changed.	2	10
We were just pretending.	2	10
Good afternoon, Mr. Draper.	2	10
Hello, Donna.	2	10
Allison.	2	10
Of course.	2	10
Surprise!	2	10
And this beautiful layette.	2	10
We've also attempted to fortify your castle.	2	10
Lucky Strike, Martinson Coffee,	2	10
Pampers, and some Clearasil, for when it gets bigger.	2	10
You raided the storeroom for me.	2	10
Now, Daddy-o, we've given this a lot of thought.	2	10
You are going to be blessed with a stinking miracle.	2	10
Stop it!	2	10
So, in assessing the damage to your private life,	2	10
we've gotten you some reading material.	2	10
What do you get for the man who's about to have nothing?	2	10
- No, no, no, no. - Speech, speech.	2	10
I'm very touched by this party.	2	10
That's the whole point.	2	10
You're not going to be touched.	2	10
I got it, Paul. Knock it off.	2	10
I want to toast all of you.	2	10
And let's hope when this baby comes that he likes Luckys.	2	10
Here's to the little one, whatever it may be.	2	10
- Cheers. - Salut.	2	10
I just wanted to say Happy Birthday.	2	10
What's this?	2	10
Tiffany's?	2	10
Who's it from?	2	10
From Jane.	2	10
And Roger, I'm sure.	2	10
Will you cut the cake, dear?	2	10
Mr. Draper.	2	10
I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.	2	10
How is everything?	2	10
About how those things are.	2	10
Joan, if you don't mind, can I borrow you for a moment?	2	10
- Of course. - Thank you.	2	10
Thank you.	2	10
And you have your meeting with Mr. Odino at 10 tomorrow.	2	10
And then Lee Garner, Jr. and the TV department at 3.	2	10
Cancel everything.	2	10
Yes, of course.	2	10
Reschedule for Friday?	2	10
No. Clear the week.	2	10
So. How was your family emergency?	2	10
Memorable. Thank you.	2	10
I assume that means everything's okay?	2	10
I'm leaving for California tomorrow for the Rocket Fair.	2	10
Good for you.	2	10
Sunshine, bikinis.	2	10
But didn't we already send a couple men?	2	10
Campbell and Kinsey?	2	10
Not yet.	2	10
Well, Campbell has got to go.	2	10
I've held his hand through 30 phone calls.	2	10
Very good, Don. Bring me a bag of oranges.	2	10
I'm sure Joan here can hold down the fort.	2	10
She's been doing it so far.	2	10
Told you you'd be in good hands with Miss Holloway.	2	10
I'll need you to send a memo to Mr. Kinsey explaining this change in plans.	2	10
I'll take care of it.	2	10
You look like you didn't get any sleep last night.	2	10
I did.	2	10
Go ahead. Lay down.	2	10
I'll keep the drunks away.	2	10
I heard it's very hard to get anything done there	2	10
because of the weather, you know?	2	10
People don't work.	2	10
Sounds good to me.	2	10
I'm sure I'll be going sometime in the next few months.	2	10
All the networks keep saying	2	10
how I need to come out and shave my face.	2	10
I mean show.	2	10
What's in this?	2	10
You're just gonna fly off and leave your wife and newborn?	2	10
I just want to say that I am so happy for you	2	10
and that you're gonna be the best father	2	10
and that I'm really happy for you.	2	10
Thank you.	2	10
- Mr. Kinsey? - Yes, Joan.	2	10
Mr. Draper wanted you to be informed that he will be going to Los Angeles	2	10
for the convention.	2	10
Great. We won't have to fly tourist.	2	10
No. It's just he and Mr. Campbell going.	2	10
What?	2	10
Don's going with Pete?	2	10
He can't do that.	2	10
I'm sure it must be disappointing.	2	10
I'll need your tickets and your badges.	2	10
That's not right. Why can't we all go?	2	10
I really need everything right away.	2	10
Or are they at home?	2	10
Is there any cake left?	2	10
Hey, Sheila. It's me.	2	10
No, I know that.	2	10
And I want you to know I've thought about it...	2	10
Let me finish.	2	10
I'm going to stand there arm-in-arm with you	2	10
and make a stand.	2	10
It's not just about you and me.	2	10
I know that.	2	10
No one's been shot lately. Okay?	2	10
I love you, too, baby.	2	10
Peggy.	2	10
May I speak with you?	2	10
Heck of a party.	2	10
Yes.	2	10
I'm going away, you know.	2	10
Of course.	2	10
On a plane.	2	10
What do you want me to say?	2	10
That I wish I was going?	2	10
Everybody does.	2	10
I've never even been on a plane.	2	10
Well, I have.	2	10
But not since my father died.	2	10
I'm sorry.	2	10
I'm not scared.	2	10
It just seems significant, is all.	2	10
Statistically speaking,	2	10
it's very unlikely that it will happen	2	10
to two people in one family.	2	10
That's true.	2	10
Besides, it wouldn't be the worst thing.	2	10
Excuse me?	2	10
I hate my mother.	2	10
What do you think of that?	2	10
Come on, you must have an opinion.	2	10
I don't know the circumstances.	2	10
I don't know what I should expect from her.	2	10
I don't know her.	2	10
Like Bud and I turned out so great.	2	10
Who's to say it wouldn't be better?	2	10
So it's not yours. That could be good.	2	10
I don't know what you're talking about.	2	10
But I think your flight will be fine.	2	10
You should go home.	2	10
Everything's so easy for you.	2	10
It's not easy for anyone, Pete.	2	10
Have a great trip.	2	10
What's there?	2	10
Glen?	2	10
What are you doing?	2	10
Nothing.	2	10
How long have you been out here?	2	10
I don't know.	2	10
A few days.	2	10
What happened?	2	10
I didn't know if I was going to see you again.	2	10
And then you weren't even home.	2	10
Did you run away?	2	10
So?	2	10
I think you should tell me what happened.	2	10
My dad wants Charlotte and me to live with him.	2	10
My mom doesn't care.	2	10
I'm sure that's not true.	2	10
She just wants to be with her boyfriends.	2	10
Does she have a lot of boyfriends?	2	10
I guess.	2	10
They give me things.	2	10
I haven't seen you in so long, except driving down the street.	2	10
I know. I know.	2	10
Can I use the bathroom?	2	10
Do you want me to wash your clothes?	2	10
Is that shirt okay?	2	10
That almost fits you.	2	10
Go ahead.	2	10
Why are you alone here?	2	10
It's the middle of the day.	2	10
It's lousy.	2	10
You understand why your mother was mad at me, I hope.	2	10
Yeah.	2	10
Because she doesn't understand.	2	10
That's true.	2	10
I'm not going home.	2	10
Because I know I'm a problem for them.	2	10
Glen.	2	10
I know I am because they keep saying I'm not.	2	10
Did you do something?	2	10
No.	2	10
But my mom is never home.	2	10
My dad has another baby.	2	10
His wife is pretty mean.	2	10
Where's your mother?	2	10
I don't know.	2	10
Writing pamphlets and handing them out.	2	10
I'm pretty responsible.	2	10
I brush my sister's teeth and put us both to bed.	2	10
That's very sweet of you.	2	10
Aren't you going to eat?	2	10
Can I tell you something?	2	10
Of course.	2	10
I don't like ham.	2	10
I don't like meat at all, actually.	2	10
I'm sorry.	2	10
Do you want me to make you some macaroni and cheese?	2	10
I came to rescue you.	2	10
Did you bring your cape?	2	10
I'm not joking.	2	10
We can go anywhere. I have money.	2	10
Glen...	2	10
- Mommy! I missed you! - Mommy!	2	10
I missed you, too.	2	10
How is he?	2	10
- Who? - Your father.	2	10
He's not good.	2	10
Carla, this is Glen Bishop.	2	10
Sally, Bobby, you remember Glen from down the street.	2	10
Hi, Glen.	2	10
Hi.	2	10
Why don't you take Glen upstairs and show him the trains Daddy got you?	2	10
You can use the controls.	2	10
Go ahead. It's okay.	2	10
What's he doing here?	2	10
You're really bad.	2	10
You think you can do any better?	2	10
If I couldn't, I'd give up trying.	2	10
What don't you like about the speed shear?	2	10
Glen, can you come in here?	2	10
Glen, get over here now.	2	10
I was worried sick.	2	10
Glen, you have to go home.	2	10
You can't do things like this.	2	10
Let's go. Your father's on his way.	2	10
I hate you.	2	10
Apologize right this minute.	2	10
No, it's true.	2	10
I hate you.	2	10
I know.	2	10
I'm sorry.	2	10
Come on. Let's wash up for dinner.	2	10
Advertising, if anything, helps bring on change.	2	10
The market... and I'm talking in a purely Marxist sense...	2	10
dictates that we must include everyone.	2	10
The consumer has no color.	2	10
Betty, I'm sorry, but we really need to talk.	2	10
There's nothing to talk about.	2	10
I don't know why he was over here, but this has to stop.	2	10
Nothing's going on.	2	10
Except that Glen feels alone.	2	10
Honestly, I don't blame him.	2	10
What did he say?	2	10
Nothing.	2	10
But it's obvious.	2	10
He depends on you for everything.	2	10
You're supposed to be taking care of him.	2	10
You're his mother.	2	10
And he gets nothing.	2	10
I thought with Dan out of our lives, it would be different.	2	10
Glen's right.	2	10
I'm not a very good mother anymore.	2	10
Don isn't living here.	2	10
I'm sorry.	2	10
We haven't told the children.	2	10
Is it over?	2	10
I don't even know.	2	10
That's the worst.	2	10
Do they see him?	2	10
He takes them to dinner.	2	10
They don't know what made them so special all of the sudden.	2	10
I don't know.	2	10
For me, it wasn't that different without him there.	2	10
Sometimes I feel like I'll float away	2	10
if Don isn't holding me down.	2	10
The hardest part is realizing you're in charge.	2	10
"As you can see, the pilot has turned off the ""No Smoking"" sign."	2	10
We're expecting clear skies en route to Los Angeles today.	2	10
It should be a pleasant day,	2	10
82 degrees and clear, with a light Santa Ana wind.	2	10

Mad Men 2x11 The Jet Set	2	11
I lay on my pillow at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.	2	11
Delicious and destroyed.	2	11
Inhaling the fragrance of the sheets.	2	11
Feeling the warmth of where you were just laying.	2	11
You make me new with laughter.	2	11
You make me old with wisdom.	2	11
You make wine taste sweeter.	2	11
Who wrote that?	2	11
I write a lot of poetry when I'm inspired.	2	11
I guess I shouldn't be surprised by anything you do.	2	11
 You shouldn't.	2	11
It's insulting.	2	11
I have to keep you in line, or I'll lose you.	2	11
Yes, you will.	2	11
I don't like the idea of making you older.	2	11
I just meant...	2	11
I don't know.	2	11
It doesn't matter how old I am.	2	11
Our souls are the same age.	2	11
Oh, God.	2	11
You're getting to me.	2	11
How do I know I'm not just going to eat another mushroom and	2	11
this room will disappear and I'll be back on a train to Trenton?	2	11
Because I love you, Jane.	2	11
 This is hard for you. I know it.	2	11
You don't want me to talk about it, but	2	11
Margaret and Mona have been your life for the last 40 years.	2	11
30.	2	11
Listen,	2	11
I'm not being impulsive, because I've been thinking about this all the time.	2	11
I want you to be my wife.	2	11
What?	2	11
Marry me.	2	11
- Roger, are you serious? - Will you do that for me?	2	11
90% of Right Guard users say they play sports.	2	11
60% wear it for their girls as well.	2	11
Most impressive, 80% of the fellas saying yes to the question	2	11
"""Does Right Guard make you feel more confident at work?"""	2	11
Did anyone watch Loretta Young last night?	2	11
I was supposed to. What happened?	2	11
I can't even describe it, it was so awful.	2	11
Creative,	2	11
you think old Donny Draper will mind if we think better on a full stomach?	2	11
Well, if you'll all swear Gillette dropped in.	2	11
Are you kidding?	2	11
Absolutely.	2	11
I'll pretend they're here if you give me some actual ideas.	2	11
Right Guard already has a great campaign, men being men.	2	11
You know, women smell bad, too. Not you, of course.	2	11
"- Women have perfume. - ""Perfume does not fight wetness."""	2	11
Loretta Young. She's my dad's favorite.	2	11
The aprons.	2	11
The nauseating upholstery on the couch. Strangers who drop by.	2	11
- Hear from Kinsey? - What do you mean?	2	11
Did you read what's going on down there?	2	11
In this day and age.	2	11
The papers said it's going to be Little Rock all over again.	2	11
I don't know why people keep stirring up trouble.	2	11
It's bad for business. Just another reason not to watch TV.	2	11
- Kurt doesn't even have one. - You have to have one. It's your job.	2	11
You're going to miss the playoff.	2	11
It's a different life for single men.	2	11
- What do you do with your spare time? - I like	2	11
- concerts. I like park. - He saw Bob Dylan at Carnegie Hall.	2	11
I heard him on the radio.	2	11
So we're not going to work at all.	2	11
Tell Right Gua, short of a new product just for women,	2	11
we need more research and time. And lunch.	2	11
Ooh. Can we split a lobster?	2	11
Does he sound like the album?	2	11
When you hear him, he plays it himself.	2	11
It must be something to see. I'd love to go sometime.	2	11
- So go. - Yes, I should.	2	11
You will go with me.	2	11
What?	2	11
You would go with me?	2	11
Oh, no. I...	2	11
I don't want to impose if you have plans.	2	11
When you hear him, you will smile like this.	2	11
- Pick you up at 8. - I live in Brooklyn. It's a hike.	2	11
Neighbors.	2	11
Joey says that Duck's in the blind. It's now or never.	2	11
This is why I booked a day early.	2	11
What did Ricardo in there say?	2	11
He's an hourly contact with TWA, and they've offered to buy you new luggage.	2	11
And fill it with my things?	2	11
Ricardo recommended a tailor.	2	11
Chinese.	2	11
And they said they've got a whole shop full of swim trunks.	2	11
I brought mine.	2	11
There's not going to be any swimming.	2	11
The convention doesn't start for another day.	2	11
You want to be the hundredth person to shake someone's hand at some convention?	2	11
For what, a free pen?	2	11
We'll follow-up face to face.	2	11
Forget Santa Monica.	2	11
Take your list, target some of these guys, and make them feel special.	2	11
Didn't Roger give you leads?	2	11
He did.	2	11
I'm going to need sunglasses.	2	11
Come on.	2	11
You wanna be on vacation, Pete? 'Cause I can make that happen.	2	11
Old-fashioned.	2	11
Excuse me.	2	11
My friends and I have been speculating about you,	2	11
trying to decide who you are and what you do.	2	11
Why?	2	11
Are you an actor?	2	11
- No. - Are you an astronaut?	2	11
No.	2	11
Someone over there would like to meet you, a young woman,	2	11
only if you were none of these things.	2	11
I'm Vicompte Monteforte d'Alsace.	2	11
- Willy. - Don.	2	11
This is Don.	2	11
She's been staring at you all day.	2	11
Can't stop talking about you.	2	11
I'm Joy.	2	11
Oh, and this is Rocci.	2	11
You look so	2	11
comfortable alone by the pool all day.	2	11
I wonder if you're waiting for someone.	2	11
I am.	2	11
Hmm.	2	11
Do you smell that jasmine?	2	11
Mmm. Dine with us.	2	11
- Maybe another time. - Well. That never happens.	2	11
Hello.	2	11
Pete, this is Joy and Rocci and Vicompte Monteforte.	2	11
Very good.	2	11
D'Alsace. Willy.	2	11
That's quite a name. Peter Dykeman Campbell.	2	11
Have we met somewhere? Newport?	2	11
I have a terrible memory for faces.	2	11
Nice meeting you.	2	11
Yes.	2	11
A pleasure to meet you.	2	11
Look for us.	2	11
Everybody here is late for everything.	2	11
Oh. I just saw Tony Curtis in the men's room.	2	11
Handing out towels?	2	11
Tony Curtis, Don.	2	11
A thing like that.	2	11
- Who's for dinner? - Rodney Barnes.	2	11
Classic salesman turned executive. And this interesting scientist,	2	11
Caleb Sawyer.	2	11
"He has this ""optiman"" thesis."	2	11
In addition to rockets,	2	11
they're going to start engineering man, you know, for travel in space.	2	11
Uh, new organs, super strength.	2	11
You know the Soviets are working on it.	2	11
Are all of our meetings like this?	2	11
It's American Aviation and Rocketdyne.	2	11
It's not a joke.	2	11
Can I get a drink here or what?	2	11
Raphael was a little tired.	2	11
But the Fifth Arrondissement has most of your good restaurants.	2	11
Of course, we kept getting lost, and every time Sherry asked for directions,	2	11
it turned out to be another American.	2	11
Well, there you go. I'll take Jane to Paris, and I'll send Mona to Reno.	2	11
You don't have to marry her, do you?	2	11
No.	2	11
Maybe you and Mona could work out one of those modern arrangements.	2	11
George, stop.	2	11
It is possible that you'll get tired of her, and then where will you be?	2	11
Mona doesn't have a right	2	11
to anything not my company money, not my family money.	2	11
She's lucky I'm giving her anything. You know what?	2	11
We've been miserable for years. I don't want to die with that woman.	2	11
Calm down.	2	11
I didn't know that.	2	11
This is the life I was always meant to have.	2	11
Congratulations.	2	11
Mona has the marriage license, and she was to hurt you.	2	11
If you want to be with this 20-year-old girl,	2	11
you're going to have to buy it from her. And I have to warn you.	2	11
Women in this situation become extra irrational.	2	11
Well, how badly does she want to hurt me?	2	11
I have a list of conditions and an alimony that could	2	11
support Rita Hayworth.	2	11
Think of all the good things in life and cut them in half.	2	11
I want you to push as hard as you can, but I want it done.	2	11
Mr. Phillips is here.	2	11
In a minute.	2	11
I'll proceed.	2	11
But I want you to think about it.	2	11
Duck Phillips, this is George Rothman.	2	11
Actually, we know each other.	2	11
Roger.	2	11
It's good to see you, Duck.	2	11
Was he for you or against you?	2	11
He's supposed to be the best. Him or Marvin Hughes.	2	11
That's who Mona has.	2	11
He's her cousin.	2	11
How bad was it? Do I want to know?	2	11
I don't think my circumstances were the same as yours.	2	11
What can I do for you?	2	11
Actually, this might not be the best time to talk about this.	2	11
Can't you tell I'd welcome a change in subject?	2	11
Well, good, then.	2	11
What the hell, right?	2	11
Listen, we're coming up on two years together here.	2	11
Did you get me something?	2	11
I think we're at a point in time	2	11
where I need to know what your plans are.	2	11
A partnership. I think I've earned it.	2	11
Right.	2	11
I'll bring it up at the next meeting of the partners.	2	11
Thank you.	2	11
Of course you might have to come in and be an advocate for yourself.	2	11
I'd be proud to present my accomplishments.	2	11
Good. Because I'm at a loss.	2	11
What is that supposed to mean?	2	11
You haven't exactly delivered on that 30% you promised.	2	11
I think we've really performed in a very dismal year.	2	11
These things are cyclical. You know that.	2	11
Is there some question about my value to Sterling Cooper?	2	11
Just think about the board. Bert Cooper hates everyone,	2	11
and his sister, well, she does whatever he says.	2	11
Don...	2	11
Don... he's only 121/2%, but I can't say he's your biggest cheerleader.	2	11
- What are you saying? - Everyone thinks you're a fine fellow.	2	11
But if I were you,	2	11
I'd go out there and make rain.	2	11
Thank you for being so candid.	2	11
This year	2	11
we have seen an historic collaboration in American aerospace.	2	11
Building on Lockheed's new Polaris A3,	2	11
Bell Aerosystems, Areojet General, and NASA	2	11
have developed a restartable rocket engine.	2	11
Can we get the lights, please?	2	11
We at Space Technology Laboratories	2	11
have set our minds to the challenges of the future.	2	11
In July,	2	11
Khrushchev said the Soviet Union now has an anti-missile	2	11
that can hit a fly in outer space.	2	11
Space Technology Laboratories	2	11
is leading a coordinated effort	2	11
to create an invulnerable warhead...	2	11
multiple, independently targetable	2	11
re-entry vehicles, MIRVs.	2	11
And North American Aviation's vernier thruster allows the primary missile	2	11
to correct its trajectory before shooting off several warheads	2	11
hidden inside its nose cone.	2	11
The MIRV can be launched from a submarine or land into the stratosphere.	2	11
Then it splits off into 14 individual warheads.	2	11
That's 14 different targets.	2	11
14 different cities.	2	11
14 individual warheads,	2	11
each with ten times the payload of Nagasaki.	2	11
Even if Khrushchev hits 35%,	2	11
that's 5 out of 14.	2	11
Secondary strike capabilities will be extremely limited...	2	11
... due to the decrease in infrastructure and population.	2	11
Total annihilation.	2	11
Do you realize that one of these companies spends more annually on media	2	11
than three Lucky Strikes?	2	11
It's a gold rush.	2	11
Where are the valets?	2	11
So much for cheap labor.	2	11
Go see if General Dynamics beat us here.	2	11
Drop these by the front desk.	2	11
You don't want them under your arm.	2	11
Hello.	2	11
I think you're happy to see me.	2	11
Well, take a good look. I have to be on my way.	2	11
Are you working?	2	11
Yes.	2	11
Oh. That's too bad. I'm going to Palm Springs.	2	11
You should come with me.	2	11
I don't know about that.	2	11
Why would you deny yourself something you want?	2	11
You want to get your things?	2	11
No.	2	11
Well.	2	11
Why don't we give it a few more minutes? Enjoy the scenery.	2	11
Order some drinks.	2	11
I think Don need to make a phone call.	2	11
Hello?	2	11
Just leave the bags there.	2	11
- Who lives here? - Friends. They're in Sardinia.	2	11
I'm supposed to be in Edward's room.	2	11
That's Stephanie in the swimming pool.	2	11
And Willy and Rocci you've met.	2	11
And there's Greta and her friend Carlos.	2	11
I'm surprised to see them in the same place.	2	11
Come with me.	2	11
Hello, Greta.	2	11
Hello, Joy, darling.	2	11
Who's this?	2	11
This is my friend Don.	2	11
I'm Carlos Villa Declan.	2	11
It's medicinal.	2	11
Alguien importante?	2	11
Good-bye, Carlos.	2	11
Come for a swim with me?	2	11
You can go inside and ask for some trunks, or you can goau naturel.	2	11
I think I should... go inside.	2	11
You're white as a sheet.	2	11
Don, are you okay?	2	11
Where am I?	2	11
You're with me, remember?	2	11
You have heat exhaustion.	2	11
- What are you doing? - It's fine. It's medicine.	2	11
Klaus is a doctor.	2	11
No. It's okay. I just need some water and some aspirin.	2	11
Everybody out.	2	11
I thought you were going to break your neck.	2	11
Next time you feel faint, lean towards the pool.	2	11
See you at dinner.	2	11
Little girl, don't get any ideas.	2	11
This man needs rest.	2	11
I found you some clothes upstairs.	2	11
Who are these people?	2	11
They're friends.	2	11
We're nomads together.	2	11
What are you all doing here?	2	11
There's an open door policy.	2	11
You should rest up for dinner. Have you ever had Mexican food?	2	11
- No. - You're going to like it.	2	11
Come out when you're ready.	2	11
You're spoiled. This is great food. This is Mexican.	2	11
It's not. I don't like Mexican. I wanted the French again.	2	11
Sweetheard.	2	11
Mexican does pig. I don't eat pig. I've already told you.	2	11
Okay, well.	2	11
- Oh, he's here. - Oh. Ah! Don!	2	11
Klaus, will you let Don sit here?	2	11
Would you like some wine, Don?	2	11
- Klaus, is that okay? - Hmm, he looks healthy enough.	2	11
- You must be hungry. - Everyone,	2	11
to our guest.	2	11
To not being carried out in a box.	2	11
So, Don, what's your story?	2	11
I don't know how to answer that.	2	11
Where are you from?	2	11
New York.	2	11
Try this. It's a pepper filled with cheese.	2	11
- Darling. - And there's the sauce.	2	11
Joy and Willy think that you're a spy.	2	11
But your wallet fell out when they carried you inside.	2	11
- You're in advertising. - Or I'm a really good spy.	2	11
You'll never meet a group people more interested in professions, and yet	2	11
there is not one of us here who has one.	2	11
I'm a physician.	2	11
But you don't work.	2	11
So I assume you're all well off.	2	11
I should take something up. I'm smarter than I've ever been in my life.	2	11
Not only do I know so much,	2	11
- but my brain is more agile. - And I didn't know that was possible.	2	11
And my muscles are remembering their skills. Are you an athlete, Don?	2	11
I've played some football in high school.	2	11
Willy was a champion fencer.	2	11
I made the Olympic team twice.	2	11
1948 London, 1952 Helsinki.	2	11
Foils.	2	11
It's hardly a sport.	2	11
Let's play places.	2	11
I start.	2	11
You have to name a place that starts with the last letter	2	11
of the place that's named.	2	11
Guarnavaca.	2	11
Alaska.	2	11
It's not a city.	2	11
- Oh. Amalfi. - Iran.	2	11
Naples.	2	11
- Stockholm. - Malaga.	2	11
Athens.	2	11
Sarajevo.	2	11
Oslo.	2	11
Whoo!	2	11
Wow.	2	11
- O is impossible. - Odessa.	2	11
Orezzo.	2	11
- Osaka. - Oakland.	2	11
- Dunkirk. - Kabul.	2	11
- London. - Nice.	2	11
Essen.	2	11
Nairobi.	2	11
Itanbul.	2	11
Lisbon.	2	11
Negril.	2	11
Lausanne.	2	11
- How old are you? - I'm 21.	2	11
How old are you?	2	11
I'm 36.	2	11
You're still warm.	2	11
Who are you?	2	11
I'm Joy.	2	11
There's glazed.	2	11
Coconut, crullers.	2	11
Oh, Bismarcks.	2	11
- Who brought these in, Cosgrove? - I haven't seen contracts,	2	11
but this is certainly a good sign.	2	11
Gosh, Joan, thank him for me.	2	11
We're going to be getting a delivery like this every week,	2	11
- with all the varieties. - Hmm, Lemonaires.	2	11
Are these for us?	2	11
The spoils of victory.	2	11
8:00 in this ening.	2	11
- Excuse me? - Our destination.	2	11
Oh. Okay.	2	11
- Where are you two going? - To the Bob Dylan.	2	11
Isn't that interesting?	2	11
Peggy and Kurt in the Village, oh, my.	2	11
Oh, don't be shy.	2	11
I think you two are adorable.	2	11
What is with this?	2	11
You think Peggy and I?	2	11
We do.	2	11
I'm homosexual.	2	11
I don't think that means what you think it means.	2	11
Kurt.	2	11
No.	2	11
I make love with the man, not the woman.	2	11
What?	2	11
Eight?	2	11
Of course. Absolutely.	2	11
Enjoy the dancing beans.	2	11
Did you know about this?	2	11
He's from Europe. It's different there.	2	11
More for me.	2	11
So Kurt is a pervert.	2	11
How about that?	2	11
He certainly had me fooled.	2	11
Mr. Cosgrove, do you want me to invite the girls in?	2	11
I knew queers existed. I just don't want to work with them.	2	11
What, he's the first homo you ever met in advertising?	2	11
You think Smitty's in love?	2	11
Which bathroom does he use?	2	11
Joan, get the girls in here.	2	11
What are you reading?	2	11
William Faulkner.	2	11
I took a survey of American literature.	2	11
So you're in school?	2	11
I was at Pembroke.	2	11
Willy has a house in Rhode Island, so it seemed convenient.	2	11
Didn't fit.	2	11
Is it good?	2	11
Sex is good.	2	11
This book is just okay.	2	11
I like sex.	2	11
You do, too, I can tell.	2	11
Greta and Carlos are arguing.	2	11
I knew they had problems.	2	11
Greta has.	2	11
Carlos never had any.	2	11
Good morning.	2	11
Good morning.	2	11
Do you hear them in there?	2	11
Oh, the humiliations have been spectacular.	2	11
Christien is coming with the children. I hope you don't mind.	2	11
No matter how late I show up, I'm never later than Christien.	2	11
Look at him.	2	11
You are so beautiful.	2	11
Papa, ne touche pas.	2	11
You are a brat.	2	11
She has her mother's temperament.	2	11
That's why you love me.	2	11
I make beautiful babies, don't I?	2	11
I'll see you outside.	2	11
That's your father?	2	11
He doesn't want people to think he's old.	2	11
Yes, it's Peter Campbell from Sterling Cooper for Clarence Hastings.	2	11
Is there any way we can meet here? I can't drive,	2	11
and there doesn't seem to be a taxi that will take me to Pasadena.	2	11
We can meet by the pool.	2	11
Thank you. How are you two today?	2	11
Duck Phillips.	2	11
- St. John Powell, how are you? - Capital, capital.	2	11
This is Alec Barton.	2	11
Duck Phillips.	2	11
By Jove, man, catch up.	2	11
I have a bit of a cold.	2	11
Well, it's warm already. It'll open up the passages.	2	11
Oh, it's warm or he would have drunk it.	2	11
So, how are you finding New York?	2	11
Brief.	2	11
We're going to visit a candy plant, the Cadbury.	2	11
- Then it's fate that I caught you here. - You say fate.	2	11
I say another round, gar?on.	2	11
Have mine.	2	11
If y're not drinking, what's this about?	2	11
I keep thinking how I miss doing things your way.	2	11
Two years ago, you said you wanted to come here and be with your children.	2	11
They're grown.	2	11
It's not a good time.	2	11
"I'm not going to take ""no"" for an answer."	2	11
I wouldn't expect you to.	2	11
You know,	2	11
if we were hiring, you would be at the top of our list.	2	11
That's too bad.	2	11
I love you New York ad men.	2	11
To our noble profession.	2	11
Cin-cin.	2	11
How old are your children?	2	11
Alec's wife is about to have their first.	2	11
Do you think that I have nothing to offer you?	2	11
No, of course not.	2	11
You represent over 20 American companies,	2	11
doing business in Europe.	2	11
I know you want a U.S. presence.	2	11
You're wasting your time doing things like digging around here for Cadbury.	2	11
And you could make a difference?	2	11
What if I were to bring you every account at Sterling Cooper?	2	11
Fully serviced and completely satisfied?	2	11
What are you talking about?	2	11
I'm suggesting that you buy Sterling Cooper.	2	11
There are very few client conflicts.	2	11
All you have to do is change the welcome mat.	2	11
I didn't know it was for sale.	2	11
Roger Sterling has a 20-year-old fiance,	2	11
and his wife's lawyer's not going to leave him a pot to piss in.	2	11
Alec, would you excuse us?	2	11
Did he send you here with a price?	2	11
Send me here?	2	11
51% will cost you a lot less than you think, plus a finder's fee.	2	11
2%.	2	11
I want to be in charge of all international business,	2	11
and I have to be president.	2	11
Creative reports to me, or the whole thing falls apart.	2	11
Thank you for thinking of us.	2	11
To old friends.	2	11
Hello.	2	11
Did you have any trouble finding me?	2	11
- Neighbors. - Right.	2	11
- Would you like some wine? - Very much.	2	11
Listen,	2	11
in the office, I hope you weren't embarrassed.	2	11
No. It's okay. It's good.	2	11
Well, if you have a man	2	11
that you'd like to go to the concert with tonight, I completely understand.	2	11
Are you not on the trip tonight?	2	11
I don't know why I pick the wrong boys.	2	11
You're drinking sad.	2	11
I don't know.	2	11
What's wrong with me?	2	11
You are old style.	2	11
No, I'm not.	2	11
This is not modern office. A working woman.	2	11
What are you talking about?	2	11
I fix you.	2	11
We should leave.	2	11
Each time, Bob Dylan is late. He will not miss us a half hour.	2	11
Sit.	2	11
Look at me. I'm very good.	2	11
Just a trim.	2	11
Yes. Yes.	2	11
For you.	2	11
- Oh, my God. - It's okay. It's good.	2	11
We're headed to Lyford Cay, Nassau.	2	11
Why?	2	11
It's what we do.	2	11
Something about taxes.	2	11
It's very different than here.	2	11
I think you'd like it.	2	11
You'll need a tuxedo.	2	11
Will I?	2	11
You don't need a passport, unless you want to follow us to Capri after.	2	11
Stephanie's uncle's an ambassador.	2	11
Joy.	2	11
My father will take care of you.	2	11
He likes having you around.	2	11
You're beautiful, and you don't talk too much.	2	11
I'm not possessive.	2	11
You can be with anyone you want.	2	11
Hello, Joy. Who is this?	2	11
Christien, this is Don.	2	11
Bernard and Amelia.	2	11
Hello.	2	11
Hello.	2	11
Hello there.	2	11
Did Isabel ring?	2	11
Why would she?	2	11
Because I'm sick of her attorneys.	2	11
These are my children. They should be with me.	2	11
Are you in Edward's room?	2	11
You can have it.	2	11
Thank you.	2	11
As you can see, we're very tired.	2	11
Come, Bernard.	2	11
You gave away our room?	2	11
Looks like someone doesn't want to sleep.	2	11
Come in.	2	11
Joyce seems to have stepped away.	2	11
I'm sorry, but Mr. Crane accidentally opened this.	2	11
Thank you, Joan.	2	11
My, oh, my. A case.	2	11
They're all there. I checked.	2	11
All the card says is that it's for you.	2	11
Well, thank you, Miss Holway.	2	11
Why don't you just take this? As a finder's fee.	2	11
- A whole bottle? - It's the good stuff.	2	11
I know. Thank you.	2	11
- Anything else? - No, thank you.	2	11
The town of Oxford is an armed camp,	2	11
following riots that accompanied the registration of the first Negro	2	11
in the university's 118-year history.	2	11
James H. Meredith was formally enrolled in the University...	2	11
Hello, all.	2	11
How the hell was California?	2	11
Looks like Draper let you off the leash.	2	11
Did you see this?	2	11
Yes, I did. Strange, isn't it?	2	11
Americans are free in short	2	11
to disagree with the law, but not to disobey it.	2	11
So how was it?	2	11
Spectacular, business-wise, but I don't know that I'd want to live there.	2	11
Here. These are for everybody.	2	11
I'd like to see it for myself.	2	11
What's wrong with it?	2	11
The people.	2	11
I don't know.	2	11
I'm glad to be home.	2	11
Has Don checked in? Is he here?	2	11
No. I don't think so.	2	11
... by force, or threat of force,	2	11
could long deny that man...	2	11
You look different.	2	11
It's my hair.	2	11
Right.	2	11
Kurt's a homo.	2	11
No judge would be sure of his...	2	11
So...	2	11
are you leaving us?	2	11
No.	2	11
So? What, then?	2	11
What if I told you that the international divisions	2	11
of General Foods, Bird's Eye, Campbell's Soup	2	11
Chevron Oil, Lever Brothers, Hoover,	2	11
Warner Brothers, Eastern Airlines	2	11
and Chrysler can all be part of Sterling Cooper?	2	11
How is that possible?	2	11
St. John Powell,	2	11
of Putnam, Powell, and Lowe, called me the other day.	2	11
They want to open up a New York office to deal with their American clients.	2	11
They love the idea of just sticking a key in the door at Sterling Cooper.	2	11
Really?	2	11
Is this as solid as American Airlines?	2	11
I guess you're happy having to scramble on the third tier of this industry	2	11
waiting for minor divisions of major companies to drop in your lap.	2	11
On the table will be mountains of money,	2	11
international prestige,	2	11
a chance at going public, and we don't have to change our name.	2	11
- I guess we could think about it. - No.	2	11
I need to know that you're open to this.	2	11
If so, I'm giving them five business days to try to impress us	2	11
with a price for controlling interest in the agency.	2	11
There he is.	2	11
There's the man I heard so much about.	2	11
Five days to make an offer.	2	11
Or you can give me a price and I'll pass it on.	2	11
No.	2	11
Let them open the kimono.	2	11
Daddy! Daddy! Over here!	2	11
This water is cold.	2	11
Stop splashing!	2	11
Don't do it, darling.	2	11
Hello. It's Dick Whitman.	2	11
Yeah.	2	11
I'd love to see you.	2	11
Soon.	2	11
No. I didn't bring it with me. Hold on.	2	11
I'll see you soon.	2	11
Sally, those go in your room!	2	12
And, Bobby, put your trucks in the toy box.	2	12
I'm not your maid.	2	12
What do you think you're doing?	2	12
Nothing.	2	12
Get over here.	2	12
You could burn the house down.	2	12
You're hurting me.	2	12
Good.	2	12
I can't believe you were smoking.	2	12
I wasn't.	2	12
 Go upstairs.	2	12
You're not going to be watching television.	2	12
You're not going to be playing with your friends.	2	12
I'm taking away Barbie.	2	12
- You're mean. - You bet.	2	12
Get in there.	2	12
I'm telling Daddy when he gets home.	2	12
Go ahead.	2	12
He left because you're stupid and mean.	2	12
You want to sleep in there?	2	12
Why won't you let him come home?	2	12
Is that what you think?	2	12
His suitcase is here, and he's not.	2	12
Daddy's on a trip.	2	12
 I told you.	2	12
It's for business.	2	12
Can we call him on the phone?	2	12
It's long distance.	2	12
And I know he'd be very upset about you doing what you just did.	2	12
Please don't tell.	2	12
Take your school books upstairs.	2	12
As soon as Carla gets here,	2	12
I'm going riding, and I want a good report.	2	12
Who wants a Popsicle when it's snowing?	2	12
Don't they sell enough during the summer?	2	12
Obviously not.	2	12
I love Popsicles.	2	12
I can't think in here!	2	12
It's a storage closet, not an office.	2	12
I called the meeting.	2	12
So where are the refreshments?	2	12
Why do moms give treats?	2	12
There's no good reason.	2	12
My mom would come out to the truck with us.	2	12
She'd break the Popsicles in half,	2	12
then give it to us like Jesus at the Last Supper.	2	12
Sounds cheap.	2	12
No. My mother did it, too.	2	12
It was great.	2	12
In Vermont, we made our own ice cream.	2	12
It was a pain in the ass.	2	12
Everyone breaks Popsicles in half.	2	12
So?	2	12
You can do it all year 'round.	2	12
It's a ritual. It's like Communion.	2	12
It's kind of Catholic, isn't it?	2	12
It's Christian...	2	12
as in behavior, not religion.	2	12
Let me tell you something.	2	12
The Catholic Church knows how to sell things.	2	12
Any calls?	2	12
Mr. Peterson had some question about your expenses regarding...	2	12
Why doesn't he just die already?	2	12
Lut?ce.	2	12
Christ. It's IBM.	2	12
Myopic.	2	12
What else?	2	12
And you have an appointment with Spence-Chapin on Thursday.	2	12
Who's that?	2	12
Spence-Chapin, the adoption agency.	2	12
I'm sorry. What?	2	12
Mrs. Campbell set it,	2	12
and, well, I'm sorry, I have to say something.	2	12
Good luck.	2	12
Yes, of course.	2	12
Thank you.	2	12
I think it's one of the most blessed things	2	12
that a person would give a home to an abandoned child.	2	12
Shall I get Mrs. Campbell on the line?	2	12
Just get me Bert Peterson.	2	12
Well, hello there.	2	12
Hello, Bertram.	2	12
Is Florence with you?	2	12
No. She's taking care of her mother.	2	12
Then we were thinking	2	12
about going to the Breakers through New Year's.	2	12
She's a good companion, isn't she?	2	12
She's moody.	2	12
Damn it, Alice. I don't ask much of you...	2	12
My stockings cost more than your carpeting.	2	12
Have you looked everything over?	2	12
It's a very generous offer.	2	12
I always say it's the smartest thing I ever did,	2	12
helping you out.	2	12
22.50 per share per year for the next 10 years?	2	12
To think that Mother thought you were a failure.	2	12
She made me who I am.	2	12
Do you mind if I have a drink?	2	12
Sweet vermouth, please.	2	12
You can trust Cleveland.	2	12
You said on the telephone you were undecided.	2	12
What's your hesitation?	2	12
I promised to take care of Roger.	2	12
Let Roger Sterling have what he always wanted...	2	12
to die in the arms of a 20-year-old.	2	12
The truth is you don't want to retire.	2	12
And I hate to say this, Bertram,	2	12
but you are old...	2	12
older than me.	2	12
I can't even imagine what that must be like.	2	12
Charming.	2	12
Please. You're not well.	2	12
This is what I do.	2	12
It's a merger. You can continue to do it.	2	12
I'll be as useful as the Queen of England.	2	12
Don't you want to go to Montana?	2	12
You ruined that poor architect's life.	2	12
Go visit your cattle.	2	12
I do love them.	2	12
But you can't trust the Brits.	2	12
I've left a letter on my bureau.	2	12
If I'm not back in two days, the police will be here.	2	12
Why would you bring that up?	2	12
Because I don't want you to hurt me.	2	12
I just want to know where my husband is.	2	12
It's a simple misunderstanding.	2	12
There's a lot of men with my name.	2	12
Well, you're the only one who used my husband's serial number	2	12
to get a driver's license.	2	12
Car title. Apartment lease.	2	12
Do you have a birth certificate?	2	12
In a safe deposit box.	2	12
Will you stop?	2	12
I saw the look on your face.	2	12
I don't know what to say.	2	12
There's been a mistake.	2	12
Can't you be a human being?	2	12
I'm his wife.	2	12
I don't care what he asked you to do.	2	12
I need to know.	2	12
I have to get back to work.	2	12
Stop lying.	2	12
You've been caught.	2	12
Don't make me do something I don't want to do.	2	12
He died.	2	12
I'm sorry.	2	12
What?	2	12
I'm sorry.	2	12
Are you sure?	2	12
He never said he had a wife.	2	12
Seven years.	2	12
I'm very, very sorry.	2	12
What happened?	2	12
He was killed in combat.	2	12
So, who are you?	2	12
They thought I was him and he was me.	2	12
I didn't think I was hurting anyone.	2	12
I can't believe it.	2	12
I just had to get out of there.	2	12
What are you going to do to me?	2	12
He never mentioned me?	2	12
I didn't know him long.	2	12
Maybe...	2	12
What's your name?	2	12
Anna.	2	12
I don't know what to say.	2	12
I'm making good money, if that's...	2	12
I know I owe you more than money.	2	12
I have his purple heart	2	12
and his dog tags, if you want them.	2	12
He wanted to marry my sister.	2	12
She looks just like me, with two good legs.	2	12
What is your name?	2	12
Dick Whitman.	2	12
Well, Dick, what do I do with you?	2	12
Well, this is a welcome surprise.	2	12
I can come back.	2	12
No. Come.	2	12
See this.	2	12
I guess all you needed was an audience.	2	12
Are you next?	2	12
I don't play.	2	12
Teddy, this is my friend Dick.	2	12
Hi.	2	12
"It's called ""In The Hall of the Mountain King."""	2	12
It's scary.	2	12
I know.	2	12
Take a lollipop. I'll see you next week.	2	12
Bye, Mrs. Draper.	2	12
You're tan.	2	12
Are you here on vacation?	2	12
No.	2	12
Business.	2	12
You look good.	2	12
Where are your things?	2	12
Or are you just here for the day?	2	12
I didn't even think about it.	2	12
I didn't mean to intrude. I can...	2	12
Are you in trouble?	2	12
No.	2	12
Well, then, what?	2	12
Can I take a shower and lie down?	2	12
Of course.	2	12
Trudy!	2	12
You're late.	2	12
Spence-Chapin. How did that happen?	2	12
I put us on the list.	2	12
And, I don't know, we went right to the top.	2	12
Well, I'm not going, and neither are you.	2	12
Peter, you're shouting.	2	12
Don't do that.	2	12
Listen to me very carefully.	2	12
We are not adopting a child.	2	12
That's final.	2	12
Will you calm down, and we can talk...	2	12
Hell's bells, Trudy! That is final!	2	12
You don't speak to me that way!	2	12
You have lost your mind!	2	12
I'm glad you're not tired anymore.	2	12
I am, but my autopilot's working.	2	12
What are you doing?	2	12
You're tired. Let me do the driving.	2	12
It's okay.	2	12
Joanie.	2	12
Stop.	2	12
Honey.	2	12
You know what? I am tired.	2	12
Okay.	2	12
Is something wrong?	2	12
Where'd you pick that up?	2	12
Greg, stop that.	2	12
You know there is no before.	2	12
Right.	2	12
I'm sorry that I don't know all the things you want.	2	12
But you do.	2	12
I'm on call again on Wednesday.	2	12
These pants have a 38 inseam.	2	12
Harold.	2	12
I would like to meet him.	2	12
I kicked him out.	2	12
Even though old ladies shouldn't be picky.	2	12
It's beautiful here.	2	12
You like the porch?	2	12
You paid for it.	2	12
I think about you.	2	12
Just in passing, I'll wonder.	2	12
They were making a commercial on the pier.	2	12
And then you called me. How about that?	2	12
You've been in California too long.	2	12
How old are your children now?	2	12
Sally is 8.	2	12
Bobby is 5.	2	12
If you don't want to talk about what happened,	2	12
that's fine.	2	12
But you can, you know.	2	12
I always felt that we met so that both of our lives could be better.	2	12
That's just how it is between us.	2	12
I ruined everything.	2	12
My family, my wife,	2	12
my kids.	2	12
I'm sure that's not true.	2	12
My brother came to find me.	2	12
I told him to go away.	2	12
I didn't know you had a brother.	2	12
I've told you things I've never told Betty.	2	12
Why does it have to be that way?	2	12
You love her.	2	12
You don't have to tell her everything.	2	12
I'm sure there are things about her you don't know.	2	12
Do you want to call?	2	12
No.	2	12
That would just confuse things.	2	12
So, what are you going to do?	2	12
I don't know.	2	12
I have been watching my life.	2	12
It's right there.	2	12
I keep scratching at it, trying to get into it.	2	12
I can't.	2	12
I'm sorry.	2	12
Did you get the same thing in your stocking last night that I did?	2	12
What are you talking about?	2	12
Putnam, Powell & Lowe has offered	2	12
to put a lot of marmalade on your toast.	2	12
Sit, Roger.	2	12
There's no rush. We have 72 hours.	2	12
Yes. Well,	2	12
I don't like being in the position of having to sell off my life's work	2	12
because you have an increase in overhead.	2	12
So Mona's crying on your shoulder now?	2	12
The late Mrs. Cooper introduced you.	2	12
Well, let her know it didn't work out.	2	12
Bert,	2	12
I know you don't think I got my hands dirty.	2	12
I'm sorry I missed the Great Depression.	2	12
Still, I have served this place for the last 20 years.	2	12
It's a merger.	2	12
We can still come to work in our building,	2	12
in our offices,	2	12
only there will be diamonds on the doorknobs.	2	12
So we'll have a meeting of the partners.	2	12
And for your information, Jane makes me very happy.	2	12
That's good to know.	2	12
As Don illuminated,	2	12
advertising is essential for aerospace,	2	12
especially in reaching out to the public	2	12
to see that congressmen vote	2	12
for the spending bills which bring new jobs.	2	12
Actual advertising, not public relations.	2	12
I have your father-in-law on line 1.	2	12
Tom. How are you?	2	12
Well, Peter, to be honest,	2	12
I don't like having to make this phone call.	2	12
Why not?	2	12
Well, we've been thinking about things over here,	2	12
and we're going to have to put Clearasil up for review.	2	12
Really? That's a shock, Tom.	2	12
Now, why would you do that?	2	12
Sales have been spectacular.	2	12
All right, calm down.	2	12
I said review, not that we're moving.	2	12
You'll have 90 days to turn it around.	2	12
Turn what around?	2	12
You're distracted.	2	12
What are we talking about, Tom?	2	12
Look, son...	2	12
Every good businessman knows	2	12
that if his wife's unhappy, his work suffers.	2	12
Yes, they seem very directly related in this case.	2	12
Don't they, Tom?	2	12
Trudy's happiness should be your first priority.	2	12
I think you should pull Clearasil right now.	2	12
I don't think you're going to get what you want.	2	12
What about my daughter?	2	12
She's my wife. That's between us.	2	12
You know what?	2	12
I was in love with Trudy when I met her.	2	12
And then you stuck your nose in,	2	12
put these ideas in her mind, and made her unhappy.	2	12
"What do you mean, you ""were"" in love with her?"	2	12
That's not what I meant, and you know it.	2	12
Yes. Perhaps it is best if we just give notice.	2	12
Good-bye, Tom.	2	12
I bought you some clothes.	2	12
Tomorrow morning.	2	12
There's something else.	2	12
What?	2	12
I met a girl.	2	12
Another one?	2	12
She's so beautiful and happy.	2	12
She's a model.	2	12
And she's from a good family,	2	12
and she's educated.	2	12
What's her name?	2	12
Elizabeth. Betty.	2	12
I want you to meet her.	2	12
Look at you.	2	12
You're in the lavender haze.	2	12
I just like the way she laughs	2	12
and the way she looks at me.	2	12
Yes.	2	12
You are very hard to look at.	2	12
I want to ask her to marry me.	2	12
Dick, that's wonderful.	2	12
Well, I need you to give me a divorce.	2	12
Well, of course.	2	12
I never thought of that.	2	12
You should hire a lawyer out here.	2	12
I'll pay for it.	2	12
And I want you to know that I'm going to take care of you forever.	2	12
You don't have to do that.	2	12
I do.	2	12
You don't owe me anything.	2	12
This whole life.	2	12
If it wasn't for Don,	2	12
- if it wasn't... - Stop that.	2	12
So...	2	12
there'll be another Mrs. Draper.	2	12
I guess so.	2	12
You'll have a family.	2	12
That'll be good for you.	2	12
I want to.	2	12
This will probably be our last Christmas together.	2	12
Why?	2	12
You can be my cousin.	2	12
No.	2	12
This is a chance at a whole new life.	2	12
Thank you, Anna.	2	12
So, where's Don?	2	12
I'm sure you remember Peggy Olson.	2	12
She'll be walking you through this.	2	12
And when Don climbs out from under the weather...	2	12
Don has signed off on all of this.	2	12
When I was little,	2	12
my mother would take a twin pop	2	12
and break it in half	2	12
and give one to me and one to my sister.	2	12
We were completely equal in her eyes.	2	12
Beloved.	2	12
Everyone does this with Popsicles,	2	12
but they may not realize what it means.	2	12
It has nothing to do with an ice cream truck	2	12
on a hot summer day,	2	12
or the flavor,	2	12
or the color.	2	12
It's a ritual.	2	12
You take it, break it, share it, and love it.	2	12
People do do that.	2	12
This act of sharing, it's what a Popsicle is.	2	12
It's the same treat from the freezer as it is from the truck.	2	12
I don't care if it's snowing or hailing	2	12
or 100 degrees.	2	12
You can still take it, break it, share it,	2	12
and love it.	2	12
I like the way she's handing out the pops.	2	12
The kids are excited, but...	2	12
the mom reminds me of something.	2	12
No, this is original.	2	12
Well, I can tell you this now,	2	12
"but we wanted something with the word ""love"" in it."	2	12
When asked, the first thing people say is,	2	12
"""I love Popsicles."""	2	12
Carson residence.	2	12
Sarah Beth, it's Betty Draper.	2	12
Hello, Betty.	2	12
I'm sorry.	2	12
I'm at my wit's end.	2	12
Sally... I think she may need private school.	2	12
How does Becky like Rockland Country Day?	2	12
Well, it's a drive, but she seems more independent.	2	12
I haven't seen you at the stables.	2	12
I saw it in the paper that Tara and Arthur are getting married next weekend.	2	12
Yes, I heard that.	2	12
I hope they're very happy together.	2	12
Are you there?	2	12
Betty, I'm sick about it.	2	12
I'm sorry.	2	12
That's why they call them crushes.	2	12
It was more than that.	2	12
Really?	2	12
I'm telling you, I haven't been able to sleep.	2	12
I keep thinking about him.	2	12
I think Raymond knows.	2	12
I can't even look at Becky.	2	12
What did you do?	2	12
Betty, I made a terrible mistake.	2	12
You did?	2	12
Don't act surprised.	2	12
He told me all the things you said about me.	2	12
I was grateful.	2	12
Why would you do that?	2	12
What?	2	12
You wanted him, too. You know you did.	2	12
There's a difference between wanting and having.	2	12
You did everything you could to encourage me.	2	12
I didn't make you do anything.	2	12
My God, you're an awful woman,	2	12
you know that?	2	12
No one made you sleep with him!	2	12
I'm going to tell you this,	2	12
and you can tell all your little friends.	2	12
This is a delicate piece of machinery.	2	12
You don't just shove paper in it.	2	12
You don't bang on the buttons.	2	12
You don't sit on the glass.	2	12
If you want it to work,	2	12
you have to treat it with respect.	2	12
What do you want?	2	12
I need to speak with you.	2	12
Honey, I have a 6:30 dinner reservation,	2	12
and unless you want to pull me there in a rickshaw,	2	12
I have to get going.	2	12
Well, I'm a copywriter.	2	12
Why, did I call you something else?	2	12
No. I don't know if you're aware,	2	12
but I brought in the Popsicle account today.	2	12
On my own.	2	12
Hey, Ginger, did you hear about this?	2	12
I gotta go. Wait.	2	12
I need my own office.	2	12
It's hard to do business and be credible when I'm sharing with a Xerox machine.	2	12
Freddie Rumsen's office has been vacant for some time.	2	12
I think I should have it.	2	12
It's yours.	2	12
Really?	2	12
You young women are very aggressive.	2	12
I didn't mean to be impolite.	2	12
No, it's cute.	2	12
There are 30 men out there who didn't have the balls to ask me.	2	12
There you are. Mr. Sterling, Miss Olson,	2	12
this is my fianc?, Dr. Greg Harris.	2	12
So you're the one who got our Joanie?	2	12
Yes, I am.	2	12
You're a lucky man.	2	12
So nice to meet you. Congratulations.	2	12
And thank you again, Mr. Sterling.	2	12
It's a pleasure to meet you.	2	12
I have a dinner reservation, and I don't think I'm going to make it.	2	12
Well, we do as well.	2	12
We're going to La C?te Basque.	2	12
I thought you hated French food.	2	12
There's a new chef.	2	12
Good night, Ginger. Pleasure to meet you, Greg.	2	12
Let me get my purse.	2	12
Fix me a drink, will you?	2	12
I don't know.	2	12
Isn't that what these guys do all day?	2	12
I've seen the movies.	2	12
Pretend like I'm your boss.	2	12
Donald Draper.	2	12
Okay, one drink.	2	12
Dr. Harris, are you trying to examine me?	2	12
Maybe.	2	12
Not in here.	2	12
That Sterling guy knows an awful lot about you.	2	12
I've been working here for nine years.	2	12
Greg, don't. It isn't my office.	2	12
It's okay.	2	12
No, I mean it.	2	12
Come on.	2	12
Greg, this isn't fun.	2	12
This is what you want, right?	2	12
Stop.	2	12
It's okay.	2	12
Greg, no!	2	12
Are you ready to go?	2	12
I don't want to miss our reservation.	2	12
No, of course not.	2	12
They're changing the guard at Buckingham Palace.	2	12
Christopher Robin went down with Alice.	2	12
Very good.	2	12
You look well, Roger.	2	12
Best baby-sitter in the world.	2	12
So.	2	12
I call to order a meeting of the partners	2	12
in the presence of our attorney, Mr. Whitehouse.	2	12
Members attending...	2	12
Bertram Cooper, senior partner,	2	12
Roger Sterling, senior partner,	2	12
and Alice Cooper, secretary-treasurer.	2	12
And Donald Draper, absent.	2	12
We are meeting to discuss the merger with Putnam, Powell & Lowe,	2	12
the details of which we've all had time to examine,	2	12
including Mr. Whitehouse.	2	12
Where's Mr. Draper?	2	12
Do you want me to go get a picture of him so you can stare at it?	2	12
His 12% makes him	2	12
mathematically insignificant.	2	12
Still, I would like to know what he thinks, wouldn't you?	2	12
He's very sawy.	2	12
Alice...	2	12
I'm sorry, I don't know whose eyes to look at.	2	12
Where is Draper?	2	12
He took a business trip to California.	2	12
He's taking some time.	2	12
Marital troubles.	2	12
Don't write that down.	2	12
He stands to make over half a million dollars.	2	12
Let's proceed, shall we?	2	12
That a '34 Sedan?	2	12
Mostly.	2	12
What'd you do to it?	2	12
Made some improvements.	2	12
It's got a '60 Nailhead, backed up '39 LaSalle transmission,	2	12
and a '40 banjo rear end.	2	12
Two Fords and a Buick.	2	12
What happened here?	2	12
Dropped the spindle 4 inches.	2	12
You know anything about hot rods?	2	12
No, but I remember these.	2	12
I used to sell them. Used.	2	12
All motor, no weight.	2	12
How fast does it go?	2	12
Well, that one does a quarter in 11 seconds.	2	12
This one's going to scare people.	2	12
Yeah, the color on that one,	2	12
I've never seen anything like it.	2	12
I'm Kess. That's my kid Doogie.	2	12
Dick.	2	12
"The color is courtesy of Boy Wonder of ""Indian-no-place."""	2	12
Walt. Indianapolis.	2	12
You guys need any help?	2	12
I'm looking for work.	2	12
Working on hot rods?	2	12
I don't know. Don't people buy them?	2	12
There's a couple of custom shops, and they do great,	2	12
but I came out here to get into it, and I'm working at a bar.	2	12
He's an artist.	2	12
He could build a car, look just like you.	2	12
I'd love to see you race.	2	12
Sunday.	2	12
Lions Drag Strip.	2	12
Long Beach.	2	12
I'll look into that.	2	12
Mr. Sterling?	2	12
Yea.	2	12
Miss Cooper?	2	12
Yea.	2	12
Bertram Cooper?	2	12
Yea.	2	12
So we'll proceed.	2	12
Mr. Whitehouse will prepare a counteroffer.	2	12
Wonderful.	2	12
Meeting adjourned.	2	12
Well done.	2	12
Look who just got richer.	2	12
This is good for you, too.	2	12
You have your children to think of.	2	12
I just have the one.	2	12
Really?	2	12
Hello, Joan.	2	12
Hello.	2	12
Have you heard from him today?	2	12
No.	2	12
Do you think it's odd?	2	12
I don't think about it at all.	2	12
Congratulations.	2	12
Thank you.	2	12
Your fianc? is so handsome.	2	12
He is.	2	12
He's the doctor you hope to see but only exists in the movies.	2	12
Thank you.	2	12
He's specializing in thoracic surgery.	2	12
It's very difficult.	2	12
And he volunteers at Harlem Hospital Center,	2	12
stitching up Negro children.	2	12
Well, he's a keeper.	2	12
When's the wedding again?	2	12
Look who I found protesting in the lobby.	2	12
Our man from the evening news.	2	12
Welcome back.	2	12
Look at you. What's different?	2	12
Nothing. How was Mississippi?	2	12
I think we made a difference.	2	12
And it was the adventure of a lifetime.	2	12
Sheila dropped him three days into it.	2	12
There's a Bankers Box in the corner.	2	12
What the hell is this?	2	12
My new office.	2	12
What?	2	12
Why don't you just put on Draper's pants while you're at it?	2	12
You have your own office? You?	2	12
I'm the head of television,	2	12
and I spend the day staring at an orangutan.	2	12
I have some unpacking to do.	2	12
Has anyone heard from Don?	2	12
Yes. He called.	2	12
He wants you to get back to work.	2	12
I'd get a new couch if I were you!	2	12
Thank you!	2	12
Do you know who I talk to about this?	2	12
I'll have it taken care of.	2	12
Christmas.	2	12
I'm getting married at Christmas.	2	12
That's wonderful.	2	12
Hello?	2	12
Sally, can you come in here?	2	12
I'm in the living room.	2	12
Hello, Mommy.	2	12
I want to talk to you.	2	12
Okay.	2	12
I realize I haven't been completely fair to you.	2	12
And if there is something you want, I'd love to give it to you.	2	12
You're getting to be a big girl.	2	12
Someday you'll want something, and I won't be able to give it to you.	2	12
Oh, Mommy,	2	12
they're beautiful.	2	12
Thank you.	2	12
You're welcome.	2	12
Can we go now?	2	12
Do you have homework?	2	12
Arithmetic,	2	12
but I can do it in the car.	2	12
Sally, now that you're a big girl,	2	12
I'm going to tell you something.	2	12
Your father and I are having a disagreement,	2	12
and he went away.	2	12
Where did he go?	2	12
I'm not sure.	2	12
When is he coming home?	2	12
I don't know.	2	12
I know it's hard to understand.	2	12
But I promise, everything's going to be okay.	2	12
Okay.	2	12
Mommy, you're bleeding.	2	12
Go take those in the kitchen and have a snack.	2	12
I'm going to change.	2	12
That's an ink blot.	2	12
You see what you want to see.	2	12
You don't have to pick them. Just put your palm on the deck.	2	12
Did you read it?	2	12
I did.	2	12
Reminded me of New York.	2	12
And it made me worry about you.	2	12
What about the cards?	2	12
Should I be worried?	2	12
It's all here.	2	12
You're definitely in a strange place.	2	12
But here is the sun.	2	12
That can't be good.	2	12
It is.	2	12
It's the end of the world.	2	12
It's the resurrection.	2	12
Do you want to know what this means or not?	2	12
No, I don't.	2	12
I can smell the ocean.	2	12
This is the one.	2	12
Who's she?	2	12
She's the soul of the world.	2	12
She's in a very important spot here.	2	12
This is you, what you are bringing to the reading.	2	12
She says you are part of the world.	2	12
Air, water.	2	12
Every living thing is connected to you.	2	12
It's a nice thought.	2	12
It is.	2	12
What does it mean?	2	12
It means the only thing keeping you from being happy	2	12
is the belief that you are alone.	2	12
What if that's true?	2	12
Then you can change.	2	12
People don't change.	2	12
I think she stands for wisdom.	2	12
As you live, you learn things.	2	12
Come in.	2	12
Hello.	2	12
Look at you, celebrating.	2	12
You getting a secretary?	2	12
Yes.	2	12
Well, she's in for it.	2	12
You should get some pictures in here	2	12
of your family or some people or something.	2	12
I want to put up my campaigns.	2	12
Isn't that Freddie's bar?	2	12
He left it.	2	12
How the hell did you swing this?	2	12
I'm sleeping with Don.	2	12
It's really working out.	2	12
I haven't told anyone	2	12
because it's probably a formality at this point,	2	12
but Clearasil's pulled out.	2	12
How did that happen?	2	12
Sales have been great.	2	12
What about your father-in-law?	2	12
I guess I'm not doing my job.	2	12
I know that's not true.	2	12
Don'll dance on my grave, if he ever comes back.	2	12
Did something happen in Los Angeles?	2	12
Yes.	2	12
He disappeared.	2	12
He didn't even check out.	2	12
I almost called the police.	2	12
Well, why didn't you? Maybe something happened.	2	12
Well, it didn't surprise me.	2	12
I know some things about him.	2	12
I'm not interested in gossip, Pete.	2	12
All I'm saying is he may not be coming back.	2	12
He's done it before.	2	12
Whatever Don does or doesn't do,	2	12
I am sure it's with good reason.	2	12
Guess I should probably go home.	2	12
Congratulations.	2	12
Good night. 	2	12
Mrs. Draper, sorry about the chill in here,	2	13
but my wife took the oil heater upstairs.	2	13
I'm fine.	2	13
So, as I thought last week,	2	13
the spotting was not caused by your horseback riding,	2	13
but rather, as I suspected,	2	13
you're going to have another baby.	2	13
Really?	2	13
Well, we've been here before.	2	13
You'll have to start eating right, sleeping,	2	13
avoid strenuous activity,	2	13
 no riding.	2	13
Just take it easy.	2	13
That's what husbands are for.	2	13
I can't believe this.	2	13
I understand this was a surprise,	2	13
but blessings come that way.	2	13
Of course.	2	13
I'll need you to undress so I can examine you.	2	13
Dr. Aldridge, are you sure?	2	13
Are you concerned about your appearance?	2	13
You've been blessed with a very resilient figure.	2	13
Dr. Aldridge, I can't have a baby right now.	2	13
Mrs. Draper, if we're having the conversation I think we're having,	2	13
there are alternatives, obviously.	2	13
 But I find it hard to believe that,	2	13
as a married woman of means,	2	13
you would even be considering that.	2	13
That is an option for young girls who have no other options.	2	13
I guarantee,	2	13
the minute you tell your husband, your friends,	2	13
you'll stop worrying.	2	13
Get in the swing of things.	2	13
Let's see if I can wrestle that heater from Charlene.	2	13
With love from Ken Cosgrove and Pete Campbell.	2	13
Why'd you need it today?	2	13
Cooper wanted the ad revenue projections early.	2	13
Why?	2	13
Great. Clearasil is missing.	2	13
Honestly, I don't know.	2	13
You don't think it's anything to do	2	13
with Draper being AWOL in California, do you?	2	13
No, I figured that out.	2	13
Campbell says there's an aerospace gold rush.	2	13
I bet Draper's landing a big one.	2	13
I haven't heard anything.	2	13
Or he's breaking off, opening his own shop in L.A.	2	13
Or he's finding a good spot for Sterling Cooper West.	2	13
I'd love to go to California.	2	13
I could get a convertible.	2	13
Whatever it is, they're evaluating us.	2	13
If Kennedy's speech goes past 8:30...	2	13
that's Lucy and then Danny Thomas and then Andy Griffith...	2	13
I'll take it in the shorts.	2	13
Why am I sick to my stomach?	2	13
Good. You're here.	2	13
I'm waiting on a call from North American Aviation.	2	13
It's 10:00 there.	2	13
They should just be getting into work.	2	13
I was just wondering if you told anybody about Clearasil yet.	2	13
I guess it must have slipped my mind.	2	13
I don't know what's going on, but Harry said	2	13
there's some kind of emergency accounting.	2	13
Everybody had to turn in their numbers early.	2	13
What am I gonna say to Duck?	2	13
That my father-in-law hates me?	2	13
Pete, just tell the truth.	2	13
Don't worry about the outcome.	2	13
People respect that.	2	13
Thank you.	2	13
I don't want you blaming Creative.	2	13
How long have you been here?	2	13
Half an hour.	2	13
I didn't want to bother you.	2	13
Where have you been?	2	13
You disappeared.	2	13
I had to have some time to think about things.	2	13
Must be nice.	2	13
Needing time and just taking it,	2	13
all on your own terms,	2	13
not wondering what anybody thinks...	2	13
me, the children...	2	13
Bets.	2	13
I'd do anything I could to undo what happened.	2	13
What happened?	2	13
I was not respectful to you.	2	13
Well, now I know I'm not crazy.	2	13
That helps.	2	13
I can't walk away from this.	2	13
I want to be with you.	2	13
I want to be together again.	2	13
I don't know.	2	13
Honestly, things haven't been	2	13
that different without you.	2	13
I need to see the kids.	2	13
I can't deal with this right now, Don.	2	13
I'll call.	2	13
We'll make arrangements.	2	13
Thank you for seeing me.	2	13
What's your poison?	2	13
I don't know.	2	13
It's okay, Campbell.	2	13
Whatever you're having.	2	13
Sit down.	2	13
Clearasil is pulling out.	2	13
Sales are strong, Creative is strong,	2	13
but we are not suited for business together.	2	13
Your father-in-law.	2	13
Yes.	2	13
That's a sticky wicket.	2	13
Indeed.	2	13
I'm working on something to replace it.	2	13
Campbell, I'm counting on your discretion here.	2	13
Okay.	2	13
The British agency Putnam, Powell & Lowe	2	13
is taking a controlling share of Sterling Cooper.	2	13
Clearasil is in conflict with Lever Brothers.	2	13
We're merging...	2	13
well, being merged with.	2	13
Your loyalty and enthusiasm during the American Airlines thing	2	13
showed real character.	2	13
Thank you.	2	13
I'd like you to replace me as head of Accounts.	2	13
I'm trusting you with this information	2	13
because I am going to be the president	2	13
of the new Sterling Cooper.	2	13
Congratulations.	2	13
Congratulations to you.	2	13
I don't know what to say.	2	13
"You say ""Thank you,"" and then you don't say anything."	2	13
Such news has to be broken in the right way.	2	13
Is Don on board with my promotion?	2	13
I'm the president.	2	13
I don't need his permission, do I?	2	13
Right.	2	13
If Don shows up, he'll fall in line.	2	13
He'll have to, or find another profession.	2	13
That's why God put non-compete clauses in contracts.	2	13
Well...	2	13
thank you.	2	13
Good evening, my fellow citizens.	2	13
This government, as promised,	2	13
has maintained the closest surveillance	2	13
of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba.	2	13
Within the past week,	2	13
unmistakable evidence has established the fact	2	13
that a series of offensive missile sites	2	13
is now in preparation	2	13
on that imprisoned island.	2	13
The purpose of these bases can be none other	2	13
than to provide a nuclear strike capability	2	13
against the Western Hemisphere.	2	13
Upon receiving the first preliminary hard information	2	13
of this nature,	2	13
last Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m.,	2	13
I directed that our surveillance be stepped up.	2	13
And having now confirmed...	2	13
...the Soviet Union	2	13
for supplying Cuba in this new military buildup	2	13
and asked Russia to stop arming Castro's Cuba.	2	13
The President did not order a direct military action...	2	13
Welcome back.	2	13
Hildy.	2	13
...if we are prepared	2	13
to sink Russian ships carrying...	2	13
...Eastern Daylight Time,	2	13
the Armed Forces of the United States	2	13
are under instructions to stop...	2	13
Mr. Draper, you're a sight for sore eyes.	2	13
Hello, Joan. It's good to be back.	2	13
How are you?	2	13
Like everyone else today, very distracted.	2	13
Don.	2	13
Hello, Peggy.	2	13
You look well. How was California?	2	13
Sunny.	2	13
Do I work for you now?	2	13
I hope it's okay.	2	13
Mr. Sterling gave me permission to switch.	2	13
I landed the Popsicle account.	2	13
So, other than her office and haircut,	2	13
is there anything new I need to know about?	2	13
After you.	2	13
The world continues without us.	2	13
There's no reason to take it personally.	2	13
Do you want to know if you've been missed?	2	13
That's half your correspondence.	2	13
Mr. Sterling has been very anxious to speak to you on a daily basis,	2	13
and Mr. Phillips, of course.	2	13
I'll need the copywriters and Sal in here	2	13
to get me up to speed.	2	13
Call Roger in a half an hour	2	13
and tell him I'll meet him in a half an hour.	2	13
And Mr. Phillips...	2	13
maybe I'll run into him in the men's room.	2	13
I sent your paychecks home.	2	13
I assume you've spoken to Mrs. Draper.	2	13
Did she call?	2	13
Not today.	2	13
I think that's enough to start.	2	13
We have a safety protocol for Civil Defense.	2	13
I don't want to start a panic,	2	13
but I think people have the right to know.	2	13
Trust me. I don't think there'll be a point	2	13
in taking those stairs or diving under a desk.	2	13
So, you're back.	2	13
What happened?	2	13
One minute I'm standing next to you in the carport,	2	13
and the next I'm tap dancing for General Dynamics.	2	13
Sorry I missed that.	2	13
I can't drive, Don.	2	13
It's amazing I made any meetings at all.	2	13
But you did.	2	13
Of course I did.	2	13
Did you ever think I'd left you there	2	13
because I thought you could handle it?	2	13
How did it go?	2	13
I'm this close to North American Aviation.	2	13
Then I was right, wasn't I?	2	13
You handled it.	2	13
Good work.	2	13
I know you want everything the minute you want it.	2	13
Sometimes it's better to wait until you're ready.	2	13
So you think I'm ready?	2	13
Yes.	2	13
You proved it.	2	13
Now I have to play a little catch-up ball.	2	13
Of course.	2	13
Welcome back, Don.	2	13
You wanted to see me?	2	13
About three weeks ago.	2	13
Hope you were looking for a job in California,	2	13
because you're going to need one.	2	13
I'll stack my absences up against yours any day.	2	13
You can't just do that.	2	13
It was important.	2	13
And from what I can see, the walls are still standing.	2	13
They are.	2	13
But we sold them	2	13
and the rest of the company to Putnam, Powell & Lowe.	2	13
What?	2	13
It's done.	2	13
They're coming in Friday to discuss strategy,	2	13
management structure, and logistics.	2	13
You'll find one of these buried in a stack of crap on your desk.	2	13
So how much?	2	13
You'll clear a little over half a million dollars.	2	13
Best vacation you ever took.	2	13
Look who suddenly has nothing to say.	2	13
Duck put it together.	2	13
Ran into them in a bar or something.	2	13
Duck was in a bar?	2	13
He doesn't have a wife.	2	13
Any conflicts?	2	13
Well, Mona hasn't been pleasant since my engagement.	2	13
No. With the deal.	2	13
But congratulations.	2	13
Thank you.	2	13
Very few conflicts.	2	13
Coop and Alice jumped on it.	2	13
I wasn't going to make trouble.	2	13
Well, now you can go back to your office	2	13
and figure out how much I made on this.	2	13
I guess so.	2	13
Kennedy's daring them to bomb us,	2	13
right when I got a second chance.	2	13
We don't know what's really going on.	2	13
You know that.	2	13
As Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro	2	13
push our leadership towards the threat of nuclear war,	2	13
it is tempting to be angry.	2	13
But I urge all of you to remember	2	13
that even on the cross	2	13
Jesus forgave his transgressors.	2	13
And although we cannot control these frightening events,	2	13
let us take charge of our own souls,	2	13
and let us prepare ourselves	2	13
for the most important summit meeting of all.	2	13
And so we pray.	2	13
We are all sinners, every one of us,	2	13
but at least give us the courage	2	13
and the common sense	2	13
to admit it,	2	13
to confess it,	2	13
and to repair it.	2	13
And give us the assurance	2	13
that when this temporary life on earth ends,	2	13
we will be welcomed back into your arms	2	13
in your heavenly kingdom.	2	13
Amen.	2	13
She's awfully quiet.	2	13
I think I know what that's about.	2	13
She's terrified like the rest of us.	2	13
I think she's being smug because she has a bomb shelter.	2	13
Really? I don't even like to go in the subway.	2	13
There's no air.	2	13
I prefer you stop talking about this.	2	13
You're upsetting my daughter.	2	13
Well, The Times says you should tell your children the truth.	2	13
You tell your children.	2	13
Carlton says he heard the market crashed	2	13
because there are Russian troops off Key West.	2	13
They're closing the Interstate.	2	13
They can't do that.	2	13
Marie, I'm about to leave.	2	13
I'm done, okay?	2	13
It's nice to feel the warmth of the community in a time of crisis.	2	13
Mrs. Draper, I'll be with you in a minute.	2	13
I wish we had a shelter so I could slam the door in her face.	2	13
Betty, you're wan.	2	13
Do you want a Miltown?	2	13
It's the only thing that's keeping me from chewing my nails off.	2	13
No.	2	13
I'm pregnant.	2	13
Congratulations?	2	13
Jessica was an accident.	2	13
Look how happy I am now.	2	13
It's not a good time.	2	13
But is it ever?	2	13
Look at this world we live in.	2	13
I can't do it.	2	13
What am I going to do?	2	13
Well, what can you do?	2	13
I don't think you understand.	2	13
It's not a good time.	2	13
Are you serious?	2	13
Yes.	2	13
There's a doctor in Albany.	2	13
If you go to Puerto Rico, they do it in a hospital.	2	13
Of course you don't want to go down there right now.	2	13
No.	2	13
Sometimes the best thing	2	13
is just to do nothing and wait.	2	13
Mrs. Draper, I'm ready for you.	2	13
I'll come by and check on you.	2	13
No, I'm fine. You're probably right.	2	13
What are you doing in here?	2	13
And where's Virginia?	2	13
The Soviets fired on us,	2	13
or we fired on them or something. Fix it.	2	13
I came in to get away from this speculation.	2	13
Damn it. You see what you did?	2	13
I hope the Soviets got a guy like you to build those missiles.	2	13
Everyone's looking at each other in the street.	2	13
They're looking at you because you've got Castro's beard.	2	13
Now they want a list of people in all the departments.	2	13
So? That's you and Danny Lindstrom.	2	13
They're counting all the money.	2	13
They're counting all the people.	2	13
You said this was about an L.A. office.	2	13
You told us it wasn't bad.	2	13
Someone knows what's going on.	2	13
I swear, if it wasn't important,	2	13
I wouldn't have asked.	2	13
We're doing what we can.	2	13
The phone company's completely overloaded.	2	13
Actually, Lois, this is more of a security issue.	2	13
Certain calls may have been made	2	13
"using the code words ""Los Angeles. """	2	13
Lois, have you heard anything	2	13
about them opening a West Coast office?	2	13
You know I'm not allowed to talk about what I hear in there.	2	13
You can tell us.	2	13
It's not going to hurt you.	2	13
We'll really owe you.	2	13
Well...	2	13
Have you ever heard of Putnam, Powell & Lowe?	2	13
London?	2	13
Yes. Trans-Atlantic.	2	13
Mr. Phillips has made a deal for them to buy Sterling Cooper.	2	13
No.	2	13
No!	2	13
It's done. They take the keys Friday.	2	13
Are they purchasing Sterling Cooper,	2	13
or are they combining with them?	2	13
It's a merger.	2	13
From what we could put together,	2	13
they want a New York office,	2	13
and they want it filled with us,	2	13
but there's definitely going to be some...	2	13
redundancies.	2	13
Thank you.	2	13
Wait a minute.	2	13
If any of you gets to stay,	2	13
one of you has to take me off the switchboard.	2	13
Yeah. Of course.	2	13
If.	2	13
- Daddy! - Daddy!	2	13
We missed you.	2	13
I missed you, too.	2	13
I like your hotel room.	2	13
There's a rollaway there for you, Bobby.	2	13
We can go to the movies or Chinese food.	2	13
I want you to behave yourselves,	2	13
and brush your teeth.	2	13
Do you want to join us?	2	13
Mommy doesn't like to eat.	2	13
No, I have plans.	2	13
Do you want to pick them up in my office tomorrow?	2	13
No, drop them off in the morning.	2	13
I'm going riding. Carla will be there.	2	13
Okay.	2	13
Good night.	2	13
Good night.	2	13
Good night, Mommy.	2	13
Can we order room service?	2	13
How can I help you?	2	13
Can I get a glass of water?	2	13
Sure.	2	13
What else?	2	13
I don't know.	2	13
A gimlet.	2	13
Thank you.	2	13
The gentleman's taken care of it.	2	13
Tell him I said thank you.	2	13
I will,	2	13
but it means he's going to come talk to you.	2	13
We'll see about that.	2	13
I think this is the place to be tonight.	2	13
I walked through Times Square.	2	13
Empty.	2	13
Doesn't seem real, does it?	2	13
That's true.	2	13
You don't look worried.	2	13
I'm trying not to think about it.	2	13
To not thinking about things.	2	13
What's your name?	2	13
Thank you so much for the drink.	2	13
I'd just like to enjoy it, if you don't mind.	2	13
No. Of course.	2	13
Nice meeting you.	2	13
...degrees for New York City.	2	13
Cloudy skies.	2	13
Further action of an unspecified nature	2	13
is being considered to deal	2	13
with the continuing Soviet missile buildup in Cuba.	2	13
That statement from Department Press Officer Lincoln White,	2	13
a revelation that construction of missile sites	2	13
is continuing.	2	13
It's delicious.	2	13
You're crazy.	2	13
Can I have a milk shake?	2	13
What's wrong with root beer?	2	13
Daddy?	2	13
It'll take 45 minutes, you know.	2	13
Daddy, knock-knock.	2	13
Who's there?	2	13
Dwayne.	2	13
Dwayne who?	2	13
Dwayne the bathtub. Mama, I'm dwowning.	2	13
Can we watch TV?	2	13
Can you watch these for me, please?	2	13
What are you doing here?	2	13
I'm waiting.	2	13
I'm married.	2	13
I was just about ready to come by and pick you up.	2	13
I know, Wally, and I'm sick about it.	2	13
I could just die.	2	13
Yeah, well, before you go and do something like that,	2	13
I got an idea.	2	13
What if I got Beaver to call your sister	2	13
and see if he could talk her into going?	2	13
Say, maybe that would work.	2	13
So what is your name?	2	13
What are you doing in there?	2	13
We were just about to close.	2	13
Anita wanted to come, but she's with the children.	2	13
That's where she should be.	2	13
My mother baked.	2	13
Thought we'd all appreciate something fresh	2	13
if we get stuck in here.	2	13
And how are you?	2	13
I don't know.	2	13
Nuclear war.	2	13
We could be gone tomorrow.	2	13
Well, isn't that always the case?	2	13
That's true.	2	13
You believe in God.	2	13
I've seen that in you from the moment we met.	2	13
Sometimes I feel	2	13
he called me to this parish to reach you.	2	13
No. I didn't know that.	2	13
Well, it's true.	2	13
Hell is serious and very real,	2	13
and unless you unburden yourself,	2	13
you cannot know peace.	2	13
I understand that, Father,	2	13
but you're upsetting me right now.	2	13
That is your guilt, Peggy.	2	13
All that God wants is for you to reconcile with him.	2	13
Don't you understand	2	13
that this could be the end of the world	2	13
and you could go to hell?	2	13
I can't believe that's the way God is.	2	13
Good night, Father.	2	13
Really? The silver?	2	13
There could be looting.	2	13
A mob is going to come	2	13
to the 14th floor of this apartment building?	2	13
I wish you would come with me right now.	2	13
What if something happens?	2	13
Rehoboth Beach is 90 minutes from D.C.	2	13
You don't understand these bombs.	2	13
Your parents' deck chairs will be on Fifth Avenue.	2	13
Are you trying to make me more upset?	2	13
If for some reason the train doesn't work,	2	13
just take a few hundred dollars in cash	2	13
and pay someone to drive you.	2	13
This is ridiculous.	2	13
If I'm going to die, I want to die in Manhattan.	2	13
Stop that kind of talk, Peter.	2	13
There's no difference, Trudy.	2	13
And I want to be here,	2	13
and you want to be with your parents.	2	13
Why do you always make it about that?	2	13
And yes, I love my parents, and they love me.	2	13
Do you?	2	13
If you did, you'd want to be with me.	2	13
You're right.	2	13
I'll help you pack the car.	2	13
The first Russian ship that proceeded through the area	2	13
patrolled by our Navy forces...	2	13
Bad news.	2	13
What?	2	13
The conference room's signed out all day.	2	13
And I checked the fridge.	2	13
There's canap?s, really good ones.	2	13
They shampooed the carpets last night.	2	13
Campbell.	2	13
PPL's coming in today.	2	13
You told me she told you that.	2	13
You're not worried? Why'd you come in?	2	13
I don't know.	2	13
I'm just waiting to see what happens.	2	13
I talked to my father-in-law about it.	2	13
Regime change is always tricky.	2	13
You want to stay neutral.	2	13
The loyalists are always hung,	2	13
and you don't want to get caught in the fallout.	2	13
What's wrong with you?	2	13
Aren't you loyal to anyone?	2	13
They don't care about us.	2	13
We're just a bunch of salaries on a ledger.	2	13
They'll draw a line and get rid of everything below it.	2	13
I like this company the way it is.	2	13
Have a minute?	2	13
From the look of this, that might be all I have.	2	13
May I?	2	13
I'm coming to you anonymously, Don.	2	13
I know something I think you should know.	2	13
What?	2	13
I know about the merger,	2	13
and I know that Duck Phillips is going to be the president.	2	13
How do you know that?	2	13
He told me.	2	13
Why would he do that?	2	13
Picking sides, I guess.	2	13
Why are you telling me this?	2	13
I don't know.	2	13
I just thought if I was you,	2	13
I would want to know.	2	13
Thank you.	2	13
You know they stopped a ship this morning.	2	13
I bet the Russians are reconsidering, now that we made a stand.	2	13
Carla, what's this?	2	13
That's from Mr. Draper.	2	13
"""Dear Betty,"	2	13
"""I'm sitting in the Roosevelt"	2	13
"""looking at the backs of Bobby and Sally's heads"	2	13
"""as they watch TV."	2	13
"""I'm not letting them change the channel"	2	13
"""because watching the news makes me sick,"	2	13
"""and they can see it."	2	13
"""I think about you and how I behaved"	2	13
"""and my regret."	2	13
"""I know it's my fault you are not here right now."	2	13
"""I understand why you feel"	2	13
"""it's better to go on without me,"	2	13
"""and I know that you won't be alone for very long,"	2	13
"""but without you I'll be alone forever."	2	13
"""I love you."	2	13
"Don. """	2	13
Gentlemen, now that we've done haggling over the dowry,	2	13
it's time to slip into the tent and spend a night with the bride.	2	13
We imagine that Sterling Cooper will remain somewhat autonomous.	2	13
You bought us.	2	13
We don't expect autonomy,	2	13
but who's going to be minding the store when you all fly back to England?	2	13
Since we've worked with him before	2	13
and he knows both companies,	2	13
Duck Phillips will be President of Sterling Cooper.	2	13
My goodness.	2	13
Obviously, I accept.	2	13
That makes sense.	2	13
Congratulations.	2	13
Well, I promise, in spite of this title,	2	13
I will treat the founders of Sterling Cooper	2	13
with the respect they deserve.	2	13
Duck, it has now become your meeting.	2	13
Tell us what you see.	2	13
I find myself a little unprepared here,	2	13
but I know this.	2	13
I'd like to bring this company into financial maturity.	2	13
The last two years, we've been held back.	2	13
Good Creative is important,	2	13
but it can't be running the show.	2	13
Our business is about buying time and space,	2	13
and right now that means television.	2	13
The bigger we are, the cheaper we can get it.	2	13
"I don't think I heard the word ""client"" once."	2	13
Well, Bert, when the economy is good,	2	13
people buy things,	2	13
and when it's bad, they don't.	2	13
There's no reason for us to be tied to Creative's fantasies of persuasion.	2	13
It certainly is an ambitious way of thinking about things.	2	13
What?	2	13
I think it sounds like a great agency,	2	13
and I think Duck is the man to run it.	2	13
I just don't think I'll be a part of it.	2	13
You don't want to be a part of it?	2	13
If this is the agency you want,	2	13
Duck is the man for the job.	2	13
This is what I'm talking about.	2	13
Artistic temperament.	2	13
Don, is this really necessary?	2	13
It is.	2	13
Because he loves this room	2	13
and hearing his own voice and saving the day.	2	13
Except this time, he's got to get with the team.	2	13
Don, you can either honor your contract	2	13
or walk out that door with nothing and start selling insurance.	2	13
I don't have a contract.	2	13
We're close.	2	13
We didn't think we needed one.	2	13
Gentlemen.	2	13
I sell products, not advertising.	2	13
I can't see as far into the future as Duck,	2	13
but if the world is still here on Monday,	2	13
we can talk.	2	13
Don, hold on.	2	13
Let him go.	2	13
It'll take a second to find some kid	2	13
who can write a prose poem to a potato chip.	2	13
Calm down.	2	13
Let him throw his tantrum.	2	13
The man disappeared for three damn weeks,	2	13
and I put this deal together.	2	13
What more do you need to know?	2	13
Duck, would you excuse us for a minute?	2	13
Of course.	2	13
This doesn't affect the merger, does it?	2	13
No.	2	13
He never could hold his liquor.	2	13
Mr. Draper, your wife called.	2	13
She wants you to come home.	2	13
You should go home as well.	2	13
I can't even think right now.	2	13
Greg says they put St. Luke's on alert.	2	13
Your bag.	2	13
I don't need it.	2	13
Good night.	2	13
...this correspondent	2	13
that there is more firepower now in Cuba	2	13
than at any time during World War...	2	13
Why are you smiling?	2	13
Because you're still here.	2	13
I was hoping the train would be empty.	2	13
Have a drink with me.	2	13
Okay.	2	13
Why are you still here? Trudy must be worried.	2	13
What is it with you?	2	13
What?	2	13
You never let me talk about what I want to talk about.	2	13
What do you want to talk about?	2	13
About what you said about the truth.	2	13
Can I tell you the truth?	2	13
Why wouldn't you?	2	13
You make it so hard.	2	13
What are you talking about?	2	13
You.	2	13
I've been thinking about everything that's going on.	2	13
And I thought...	2	13
who'd care if I was gone?	2	13
I mean, Trudy would care,	2	13
but she doesn't know me.	2	13
But you do.	2	13
And I know you.	2	13
And I think you're perfect.	2	13
I'm not perfect, Pete.	2	13
Yes, you are.	2	13
And I wish I had picked you then.	2	13
Pete.	2	13
I love you.	2	13
And I want to be with you.	2	13
What?	2	13
Didn't you know that?	2	13
Pete,	2	13
I could have had you in my life forever if I wanted to.	2	13
What do you mean?	2	13
I could have had you.	2	13
I could have shamed you into being with me.	2	13
But I didn't want to.	2	13
I don't understand.	2	13
You got me pregnant.	2	13
I had a baby,	2	13
and I gave it away.	2	13
What?	2	13
I had your baby,	2	13
and I gave it away.	2	13
Are you serious?	2	13
You can't be serious.	2	13
I wanted other things.	2	13
I don't understand.	2	13
Well,	2	13
one day you're there...	2	13
and then, all of a sudden...	2	13
there's less of you,	2	13
and you wonder	2	13
where that part went,	2	13
if it's living somewhere outside of you.	2	13
And you keep thinking...	2	13
maybe you'll get it back.	2	13
And then you realize...	2	13
it's just gone.	2	13
Why would you tell me that?	2	13
I'm sorry, Pete.	2	13
- Daddy! - Daddy!	2	13
You're home.	2	13
At about 2 p.m.	2	13
yesterday afternoon,	2	13
set out to intercept the Marucla.	2	13
She was assisted by S2F's tracker aircraft.	2	13
The Pierce made contact with the Marucla...	2	13
They finally went down.	2	13
...at about 10:30 p.m. last night,	2	13
Eastern Daylight Time.	2	13
Sometime after midnight...	2	13
I have to talk to you.	2	13
the Pierce was joined by the destroyer Joseph R. Kennedy.	2	13
I have something to tell you.	2	13
What?	2	13
I'm pregnant.	2	13
Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA	2	13
I'd put you through that window.	3	1
Last season on Mad Men.	3	1
He's leaving me for a secretary.	3	1
I want you to be my wife.	3	1
You've an office. I'm the Head of the Tv.	3	1
Damn it Don. I know you having an affair.	3	1
- It's okay. - Greg! No.	3	1
It's man	3	1
Don't come home. I don't care what you do. I just don't want you here.	3	1
What if I were to bring you every account of Sterling Cooper?	3	1
I ruined everything.	3	1
 I had your baby.	3	1
- And I gave it away. - Why would you tell me that?	3	1
You bought us. We dont't expect autonomy.	3	1
I'm pregnant.	3	1

Season 3 Episode 1 Out of Town	3	1
Do you know how hard I've prayed?	3	1
Why does he make me suffer?	3	1
God will give you a child.	3	1
Let me see her.	3	1
So you killed another one.	3	1
Because you had nothing to do with this.	3	1
Maybe you ought to stay off her once in a while.	3	1
Get out, you witch!	3	1
 I've got 85,	3	1
and my boots are off.	3	1
You don't have a sheep.	3	1
I'll get one,	3	1
but that'll be another quarter	3	1
and this is all I have.	3	1
Go wash yourself.	3	1
You get me in trouble	3	1
I'm gonna cut your dick off and boil it in hog fat.	3	1
I'm gonna cut his dick off...	3	1
I'm gonna cut his dick off and boil it in hog fat.	3	1
What was that, sweetheart?	3	1
I'm cold.	3	1
Do you want to hold him?	3	1
I'm gonna cut his dick off and boil it in hog fat.	3	1
It's midnight.	3	1
What do you want?	3	1
I told you God would give you a child.	3	1
Whose is it?	3	1
Is your husband home?	3	1
God is giving you a child.	3	1
His name is Dick,	3	1
after a wish his mother should've lived to see.	3	1
Come on. Drink this.	3	1
You know, there's no point in both of us not sleeping.	3	1
She wakes up at night when I drop off.	3	1
Are you so sure it's a girl?	3	1
Well, believe me, she knows what she wants.	3	1
I packed your valise.	3	1
- I could have done that. - Well, you'll get a chance...	3	1
The clasp was broken.	3	1
Carla said she saw Sally hitting it with a hammer.	3	1
She's taken to your tools like a little lesbian.	3	1
Am I ever going to sleep again?	3	1
At least you don't look tired.	3	1
I just want everything to be perfect.	3	1
I want her to come into our home at its best.	3	1
Close your eyes.	3	1
You're on a warm sandy beach...	3	1
Because I'm a whale.	3	1
You're on a warm	3	1
sandy beach.	3	1
You can smell the faint scent of coconut oil.	3	1
And as you slide your hands,	3	1
you feel that cold patch of sand underneath the shadow	3	1
of your deck chair.	3	1
You're good at this.	3	1
Hello?	3	1
Yes, but on occasion,	3	1
you have to resign yourself to sleeping where you are.	3	1
That's why they sell subway tokens, silly.	3	1
You look lovely today.	3	1
Thank you.	3	1
Are you here to see me?	3	1
No, I'm just verifying some information.	3	1
Thank you, lola.	3	1
He just always stops by concerning the strangest things.	3	1
- Yesterday it was my engagement ring. - Enough, Lola.	3	1
You know there's something about the way he talks.	3	1
I could listen to him read the phone book.	3	1
"When he gets to ""s"""	3	1
I need Howard Sullivan at Lever Brothers.	3	1
Remarkable.	3	1
I picked it for its sensuality,	3	1
but it also in some way	3	1
reminds me of our business.	3	1
Who is the man who imagined her ecstasy?	3	1
Who indeed?	3	1
We were just talking about you.	3	1
Burt's on his way. Where's Roger?	3	1
Probably taking another Grecian treasure out of its crate.	3	1
I apologize for Baltimore.	3	1
It has to be done.	3	1
It's a sales call. Isn't there more I can do here?	3	1
It's not a sales call.	3	1
You're the face of our business.	3	1
They need someone they can trust.	3	1
London fog...	3	1
How ludicrous.	3	1
Really? I have one.	3	1
- So do I. - No, of course...	3	1
It's just the name.	3	1
There is no fog in London.	3	1
There is no London fog.	3	1
- Are you sure about that? - Quite.	3	1
Never was.	3	1
It was the coal dust from the industrial era...	3	1
Charles Dickens and whatnot.	3	1
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Peterson is here to see you.	3	1
- Come on in, Burt. - Hey, Don.	3	1
Bert, Lane.	3	1
We need you to have a seat, Burt.	3	1
You got a blindfold too?	3	1
This isn't easy.	3	1
It really isn't.	3	1
Oh God.	3	1
I really thought I'd made it.	3	1
I know it's unkind, but it's generous and it's fair.	3	1
Why the hell did you wait so long?	3	1
It was brought to our attention that your wife was undergoing radiation.	3	1
We thought it decent to wait.	3	1
That was decent.	3	1
Sorry I'm late.	3	1
Did I miss anything?	3	1
Sad meeting.	3	1
Sorry about that.	3	1
It wasn't easy.	3	1
We'll see how you do without my Rolodex.	3	1
- We're going to take that risk. - You make me sick.	3	1
You're the dying empire.	3	1
- We're the future. - Burt, control yourself.	3	1
I'm the Head of Accounts, damn it!	3	1
I'm sure we'll regret it.	3	1
I'm serious.	3	1
See you on the bread lines, fellas.	3	1
Is that the last of it?	3	1
Because I don't like how much I'm getting to used to these.	3	1
I don't know anything you don't know.	3	1
You understand there's no point ever in making over $40,000	3	1
when you'll be taxed 69%?	3	1
You're working for them. And God forbid you really make it...	3	1
- Everything over 70 grand is 81%. - Even if you're married?	3	1
Fellow comrades in mediocrity,	3	1
I want you to listen very carefully.	3	1
You can all go straight to hell.	3	1
I heard he's going in-house at Nabisco.	3	1
- You're sure it's not starting again? - Mr. Campbell's office.	3	1
- What? - I'll let him know.	3	1
- The firings. - Mr. Campbell,	3	1
Mr. Pryce wants to see you.	3	1
I'm at lunch.	3	1
I'll bring you a doggy bag.	3	1
Holy crap.	3	1
You couldn't have pulled me aside to say that?	3	1
I'm sure it's nothing.	3	1
How the hell am I supposed to live like this?	3	1
Drop dead, you limey vulture!	3	1
Son of a bitch!	3	1
I assume you can continue handling this beautifully	3	1
while I dispense psychotherapy to the girls in the pool.	3	1
You americans don't know how to handle your emotions.	3	1
- It's unbecoming. - His wife is sick,	3	1
and if you had talked to his girl, she would've informed him.	3	1
So he would've had a long walk to Mr. Cooper's?	3	1
And if you had talked to me, I would have been waiting with his coat	3	1
and his Rolodex.	3	1
While we're on the topic of decorum,	3	1
I'd like to speak to you about the way I'm being addressed.	3	1
Could you be more specific?	3	1
The switchboard. I'm not John.	3	1
I'm Mr. Hooker.	3	1
That's the way they've been taught to address the secretaries.	3	1
As I've explained, in Great Britain...	3	1
A truck is a lorry, and an elevator is a lift.	3	1
I've got it, mr. Hooker.	3	1
Despite your title, you are not a secretary.	3	1
I'm Mr. Pryce's right arm.	3	1
I'm not his typist.	3	1
Of course.	3	1
I assume you will let him know when Mr. Peterson has left the building.	3	1
- How are we today? - Very well, thank you.	3	1
Burt Peterson's left the agency.	3	1
- Really? - Yes.	3	1
I can't speak for everyone here,	3	1
but I like you.	3	1
And I like you.	3	1
But you don't know me.	3	1
But I will make that effort if given the opportunity.	3	1
Pardon?	3	1
I apologize that I haven't been more welcoming, socially.	3	1
It seemed until your wife arrived...	3	1
I didn't want to make it awkward with a threesome.	3	1
Although, now that I think of it perhaps your being alone is all the more reason	3	1
- I should've offered my hospitality. - Do have a seat.	3	1
Why?	3	1
Is something wrong?	3	1
I don't know. You just removed the head of my department and now	3	1
you're offering me a chair.	3	1
How cruel of me.	3	1
I wanted to inform you that you're now Head of Accounts.	3	1
- Excuse me? - It seemed like the right thing to do,	3	1
despite your lack of hospitality.	3	1
The specifics are pending, as is the announcement.	3	1
Is this really happening?	3	1
I need to know it's certain.	3	1
Oh yes, but...	3	1
Wonderful.	3	1
Thank you.	3	1
Splendid.	3	1
Well, it turns out things are splendid.	3	1
- That's good. - Could you get my wife on the phone?	3	1
I have Mrs. Campbell for you.	3	1
- How are you sweetheart? - What are you doing?	3	1
I told you this morning	3	1
I'm having luncheon with the docents' committee from the met.	3	1
- How are they? - Since when do you care?	3	1
Since I was made Head of Accounts.	3	1
Oh my goodness.	3	1
- That's wonderful! - It really is.	3	1
I knew it would happen one day for real.	3	1
I love the sound of your voice right now.	3	1
That's because I'm already drunk.	3	1
Good for you.	3	1
Just one more minute. My husband got some good news.	3	1
Make a reservation.	3	1
Surprise me.	3	1
I should call my mother.	3	1
Don't go to the well. There's no water there.	3	1
I don't even know if I'm getting a raise.	3	1
I didn't ask. I forgot.	3	1
That's very noble. You see?	3	1
One doesn't need money to be fulfilled.	3	1
Don't let those ladies from the met hear you say that.	3	1
I should go.	3	1
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.	3	1
I heard you wanted to see me, so I grabbed a sandwich.	3	1
What can I do for you?	3	1
Mr. Peterson's left the agency.	3	1
If that's your news, I think you've been scooped.	3	1
So you've heard?	3	1
"Let's just say he did not ""go gentle into that good night."""	3	1
So you're probably wondering where that leaves you.	3	1
Should I be worried?	3	1
No, I should say not.	3	1
We're making you Head of Accounts.	3	1
Spectacular.	3	1
Thanks a lot.	3	1
We're charting the course of transition right now.	3	1
There are many details to come.	3	1
I wouldn't be much of an account man if I didn't ask what it pays.	3	1
I wouldn't be much of a financial officer	3	1
if I wasn't prepared to disappoint you.	3	1
It's 21,	3	1
but we'll reevaluate this year.	3	1
Ken, this is not for broadcast.	3	1
There'll be a formal announcement.	3	1
Great.	3	1
Can you believe this?	3	1
What's the world coming to?	3	1
That is a big bottle.	3	1
That's not a bottle. That's his date.	3	1
"""My oh my, what a big bottle you have."""	3	1
"""I'm sorry, honey, but I'm taken."""	3	1
"""I just pawned my typewriter so we could be together all weekend."""	3	1
The captain's about to announce our descent into friendship.	3	1
- Quick refill? - I don't know.	3	1
Don't you need something to run the plane?	3	1
And what about you, mr. Hofstadt?	3	1
Excuse me?	3	1
I took a look at your luggage.	3	1
You're William Hofstadt?	3	1
Bill. Call me bill.	3	1
And this is my associate,	3	1
mr. Fleischmann.	3	1
Are you headed to Baltimore or DC?	3	1
- Baltimore. - Well, how about that?	3	1
We're heading to hausner's for dinner.	3	1
You should've been in line two hours ago if you want to eat by 8:00.	3	1
Lorelei has made some inroads with the maitre d'.	3	1
We have to check in and we have an early meeting.	3	1
- Where are you staying? - The Belvedere.	3	1
Well, this is too much. Us too.	3	1
7:30.	3	1
It'll be a hoot and a half.	3	1
Now you have to take someone else's luggage...	3	1
Bill Hoffman's.	3	1
Hofstadt...	3	1
My brother-in-law.	3	1
He borrowed a suitcase to go to Puerto Rico,	3	1
but he never tires of putting his name on other people's things.	3	1
I've flown a few times,	3	1
but I've never actually seen a stewardess that game.	3	1
Really?	3	1
Any plans tonight?	3	1
All I know is to avoid grand central.	3	1
I heard Burt Peterson's still at the bar.	3	1
Now now.	3	1
It had to happen, I guess.	3	1
He didn't put up much of a fight...	3	1
Not counting today, I mean.	3	1
It's a tough job.	3	1
No doubt about that.	3	1
I just want to let you know	3	1
I've always been a big fan of your work	3	1
and I've been very vocal about it.	3	1
I appreciate that.	3	1
Maybe now things will finally settle down.	3	1
That's true.	3	1
Listen, I just want to say	3	1
that through all of this	3	1
I know that you were there reminding me that	3	1
I can do this job.	3	1
Well, you're welcome.	3	1
I guess it's because I think you can.	3	1
- Have a good night. - You too.	3	1
And my friend and I were listening to some radio program	3	1
and we had this huge bag of fritos...	3	1
We're not allowed in uniform...	3	1
So at some point my friend stops eating,	3	1
but I can't.	3	1
And I ate all of them and I got so...	3	1
It was quite unladylike.	3	1
And I still can't eat them to today.	3	1
Too much of a good thing.	3	1
It happens.	3	1
I think accounting sounds fascinating...	3	1
Going through other people's bank accounts.	3	1
It sounds sexy.	3	1
Jesus, Lorelei,	3	1
how deep did you have to dig to come up with that?	3	1
Why would you insult a man's profession?	3	1
No, it's okay.	3	1
I don't usually tell people I'm an accountant.	3	1
Listen,	3	1
I didn't mean to insult your profession.	3	1
Don't sweat it.	3	1
Of course, you do know there are different kinds of accountants.	3	1
Are there?	3	1
Tell 'em what we do.	3	1
I don't know, Bill.	3	1
I'm gonna have to swear you all to secrecy.	3	1
You can't guarantee that.	3	1
You're right.	3	1
Well, someone just brought everything to a screeching halt.	3	1
We'll be good.	3	1
You ever heard of James Hoffa?	3	1
You know, I don't just throw away newspapers every day.	3	1
I also read them.	3	1
There is a lot of money missing.	3	1
And they don't really keep receipts.	3	1
So you're a couple of G-men?	3	1
No, we're accountants.	3	1
Isn't the service exquisite?	3	1
I'm based in New York. I'd always rather be there,	3	1
but it's my job to be out of town.	3	1
I don't know.	3	1
I keep going to a lot of places and ending up somewhere	3	1
I've already been.	3	1
How about a nightcap?	3	1
I don't know.	3	1
Your face is red.	3	1
Order for us.	3	1
Felt self-conscious there for a moment.	3	1
We're the only ones without a uniform.	3	1
- Good night, Bill.	3	1
It's been swelly.	3	1
Well, this is me.	3	1
Let me see if it's different than my floor.	3	1
What are we doing?	3	1
I don't know.	3	1
I'm engaged.	3	1
On the other hand...	3	1
You might be my last chance.	3	1
I've been married a long time.	3	1
You get plenty of chances.	3	1
It's my birthday.	3	1
Really?	3	1
Is it?	3	1
It really is.	3	1
Let me see your driver's license.	3	1
That's not gonna help.	3	1
Happy birthday.	3	1
Hello.	3	1
My air conditioner does not work.	3	1
It is stagnant in here.	3	1
Take your hand out. I can't breathe.	3	1
Stand up.	3	1
Lorelei thinks you look like ty power.	3	1
You remember him?	3	1
Go on.	3	1
And while you're distracted, I'm gonna take off my shoes.	3	1
Is that okay?	3	1
Your turn.	3	1
Not yet.	3	1
Do you like?	3	1
Everyone's always asking me if I was a model,	3	1
but I wasn't.	3	1
The one I have at home is different.	3	1
I hope I didn't break it.	3	1
No, it's fine. Just a minute.	3	1
Thank you.	3	1
Airplane.	3	1
Oh, God.	3	1
Oh, Jesus.	3	1
- Whats that? - Fire alarm.	3	1
Come on, let's go.	3	1
Come on. Forget your shoes. Let's go. Come on.	3	1
Come on.	3	1
- Do you have another cigarette?	3	1
Everything's okay, folks!	3	1
- Morning. - Morning.	3	1
You ever get nervous wearing that on the subway?	3	1
I don't ride the subway.	3	1
I do worry about being followed, though.	3	1
I think lola takes a horse and buggy.	3	1
She's never on time.	3	1
I'm not at work yet.	3	1
I don't want to sit in my office and listen	3	1
to someone talk about their water retention.	3	1
Peggy, brides are very self-conscious.	3	1
If she's so worried about getting married,	3	1
then why is she shamelessly flirting with Moneypenny all the time?	3	1
Don't call him that. He hates that.	3	1
Are you defending him?	3	1
He's repellant. He reminds me of a doorman.	3	1
And the typing she does for him?	3	1
God, I'm so glad I'm gonna be out of here soon.	3	1
- That's very comforting, Joan. - There's nothing I can do.	3	1
Congratulations.	3	1
Thank you.	3	1
Mr. Pryce just called. There's a meeting for the Heads of Accounts immediately.	3	1
Excuse me?	3	1
Mr. Pryce called a big meeting for you and Mr. Cosgrove.	3	1
What are you talking about?	3	1
Whatever the circumstances, it's nice to see you.	3	1
I'm just here to show you the continuity of our service.	3	1
With or without Burt Peterson, you are on our mind.	3	1
- I apologize. - Morris, you remember Salvatore Romano.	3	1
I don't know how, but I left my plane ticket at the hotel.	3	1
He's the guy with the marker who always does what I say.	3	1
- Words, pictures. - Sal, this is Howard.	3	1
Pleasure.	3	1
I don't remember...	3	1
Do you have a family?	3	1
Not yet. I have a wife.	3	1
Howard is my son. He's gonna be part of this from now on,	3	1
starting with taking you two gentlemen on a tour.	3	1
That's it?	3	1
You're not gonna say anything?	3	1
My father is extremely concerned about the business right now.	3	1
Well, is it about our work?	3	1
We don't want to take credit for everything,	3	1
but two of every three raincoats sold last year	3	1
"had ""london fog"" stitched on the inside pocket."	3	1
Dad is worried that everyone	3	1
who is ever going to buy a raincoat already has one.	3	1
Because a business has to get bigger every year.	3	1
That's capitalism.	3	1
Well, our worst fears lie in anticipation.	3	1
That's not me, that's Balzac.	3	1
Balzac, huh?	3	1
You are not Burt Peterson.	3	1
I've been investigating umbrellas, bags, hats.	3	1
There are companies that all they do is make hats.	3	1
London fog is a 40-year-old brand	3	1
that sounds like it's existed forever.	3	1
You have established, with our help,	3	1
that it means one thing... raincoats.	3	1
New products aside, there will be fat years	3	1
and there will be lean years,	3	1
but it is going to rain.	3	1
That's true.	3	1
Let's see if we can find you some earplugs.	3	1
And now for Mr. Campbell.	3	1
- Why does he have Utz? - Some of this was done	3	1
based on accounts, some of this was done based on relationships.	3	1
You figure out what happened with Utz.	3	1
So you decided all of this?	3	1
42 of every dollar at this agency is spent in the television department.	3	1
But no, we did.	3	1
- What are these os for? - Olson.	3	1
- She's all over the place. - You know that's not true.	3	1
You're each taking half the company.	3	1
Of course it's possible someone could distinguish themselves.	3	1
Would be easier that way.	3	1
Can you believe this?	3	1
If you're upset, you seem to be hiding it.	3	1
I'm excited. I mean.	3	1
I feel badly about Burt Peterson...	3	1
Three kids, wife with cancer.	3	1
But you greased up the chute and shoved him down it.	3	1
What could possibly be the matter?	3	1
Why did you even accept this? You have no interest in this.	3	1
Why wouldn't I want this?	3	1
Because you're no good.	3	1
They want us to hate each other.	3	1
I refuse to participate in that.	3	1
Very nice.	3	1
Very very nice.	3	1
Look at you... Never break a sweat. You're right.	3	1
I should just lay down, and we should run together, holding hands.	3	1
What time is it?	3	1
1:15.	3	1
We should be back in the office by 3:00.	3	1
We're going back to the office?	3	1
I'm going to ask you something,	3	1
and I want you to be completely honest with me.	3	1
London fog...	3	1
It's a subway car	3	1
and there's a commuter looking up.	3	1
There's a girl with her back to us.	3	1
She's wearing one	3	1
of those short tan ones, but it's open.	3	1
Her legs are bare.	3	1
We know what he's seeing.	3	1
"""Limit your exposure."""	3	1
That's it.	3	1
Good.	3	1
Mr. Hooker, may I speak with you?	3	1
I thought it was a good idea that P. P. l. had an office	3	1
for when visitors come.	3	1
Of course, it would make sense for someone to be occupying it	3	1
in the meantime.	3	1
I rustled up an office for you.	3	1
I hope you find it appropriate to your status.	3	1
My position.	3	1
It's near Mr. Pryce. It's not exactly in the thick of things,	3	1
but you will have someone to attend to your typing	3	1
to avoid you siphoning off the man-hours.	3	1
My own girl...	3	1
- Of my choosing? - I will have a lineup.	3	1
Did he take the ant farm?	3	1
No, it's actually mr. Cooper's. It just lives there.	3	1
Hello, sweetheart.	3	1
Now don't be cross. I'll only be a minute.	3	1
- Do you have a fever? - No.	3	1
"""Peter Campbell."""	3	1
"""The buck stops here!"""	3	1
"""The buck stops here""..."	3	1
Unless it stops over there.	3	1
- What's the matter? - There's two Heads of Accounts.	3	1
Kenny Cosgrove and I are sharing it.	3	1
I'm so sorry.	3	1
I was sitting there and they just...	3	1
read off a list of names, a list of companies.	3	1
That's my life.	3	1
I know you won't like hearing this,	3	1
but you're a lot like my father.	3	1
You're an ambitious man,	3	1
and an ambitious man is never happy with what he has.	3	1
Why does it always have to be like this?	3	1
Why can't I get anything good all at once?	3	1
This is an amazing opportunity.	3	1
They believe in you. Don't turn it sour.	3	1
It's a test.	3	1
Why not just cut it short and tell them I want it?	3	1
You can do whatever you want, but they do not want to hear your outrage.	3	1
They want you to beat Ken.	3	1
I know what they want, Trudy.	3	1
And honestly,	3	1
I don't know.	3	1
I can't live with this!	3	1
But you'll try.	3	1
That's great.	3	1
It's a great ad.	3	1
So how was everything in Baltimore?	3	1
Out of town. Don Draper.	3	1
- It was first class. - Go on.	3	1
Two old married men.	3	1
There was a fire in the hotel, but no casualties.	3	1
- That's too bad. - For casting this lucky fellow	3	1
in the subway, what's he look like?	3	1
I don't know.	3	1
A little excited.	3	1
- A little shocked. - No, what's he look like?	3	1
Handsome.	3	1
Your girl's gone.	3	1
I have Stolichnaya	3	1
and cuban cigars.	3	1
I sent them from Greece.	3	1
I should've tried a pound of opium.	3	1
Help yourself.	3	1
So Cosgrove versus Campbell.	3	1
Is Cooper playing God or Darwin?	3	1
I know it sounds japanese, but it's not Cooper.	3	1
Lane read about it in some management book?	3	1
I think it came from the home office.	3	1
When he told me about it, I thought he was joking.	3	1
I told him it was a stupid idea,	3	1
but they don't always get our inflection.	3	1
Can I speak with you for a moment?	3	1
Come in.	3	1
What?	3	1
I just wanted to let you both know	3	1
how honored I am with this promotion.	3	1
Help yourself.	3	1
- Not the Stoli.	3	1
Hello.	3	1
I was going to tell Don,	3	1
but I can tell you myself.	3	1
I have an old pal at the mayor's office	3	1
that wants to do a small campaign for...	3	1
I don't know... Something about	3	1
penn station.	3	1
It'd be my pleasure.	3	1
Is there any brandy?	3	1
Any glass will do.	3	1
I told him that despite life	3	1
under british rule,	3	1
we still had	3	1
a real yankee.	3	1
I don't care what they say...	3	1
London fog is a great name.	3	1
I like the ants.	3	1
There's no shortage of distractions here.	3	1
Now if we can find a proper pub,	3	1
we'll have everything.	3	1
Why do you have this office?	3	1
I thought it was necessary	3	1
that we have place for when superiors visit.	3	1
Of course, it would make sense	3	1
for someone to occupy it in the meantime.	3	1
It's a hare-brained idea.	3	1
We just fired one-third of their workforce.	3	1
It's unseemly to go through their pockets as well.	3	1
A visitor's office is good, but you sit out front.	3	1
Of course.	3	1
It was presumptuous.	3	1
This place is a gynocracy.	3	1
I hadn't noticed.	3	1
My only point is	3	1
if you decide to take the train tomorrow	3	1
and you run into Carlton, I told them we were busy.	3	1
Our stories are straight.	3	1
Sally has something to tell you.	3	1
I got it out of her.	3	1
Out.	3	1
Go ahead.	3	1
I'm sorry I broke your suitcase.	3	1
Find out how much it is to repair,	3	1
and it'll come out of your allowance.	3	1
I don't have an allowance.	3	1
Then don't break things.	3	1
I just thought...	3	1
I just didn't want you to go.	3	1
Come here.	3	1
I will always come home,	3	1
and you'll always be my girl.	3	1
Your eyes look tired.	3	1
I don't sleep well when I'm not here.	3	1
You squint too much.	3	1
You need reading glasses.	3	1
Daddy!	3	1
Are these for me?	3	1
Yes.	3	1
Give me that. It's a stickpin.	3	1
There you go.	3	1
Was I really in there?	3	1
Nine months.	3	1
Tell me about the day I was born.	3	1
Well, it was	3	1
the middle of the night	3	1
and it was raining	3	1
very hard.	3	1
I had just come home from work.	3	1
He did not feel like getting back in the car,	3	1
but he did.	3	1
He took my suitcase	3	1
and my little stuffed eeyore that I knew I was going to give you.	3	1
Is there more? I love her.	3	2
I saw Susan Watson do it on Broadway, and she was great,	3	2
- but she didn't have that. - Well, it's not going to be her,	3	2
"but they want that scene ""frame for frame,"" as they say."	3	2
So, something about how desperate she is for a Pepsi?	3	2
It's for Pepsi, but it's not for Pepsi. It's called Patio,	3	2
and it's a dieter's kind of Pepsi to help women reduce.	3	2
It's Pepsi's diet-right cola,	3	2
and there's claims that their lawyers went over calories, etcetera.	3	2
If we do it right, we land Patio.	3	2
And if we land Patio, I'll be at lunch with Pepsi.	3	2
 - I think Pete Campbell just broke a sweat. - I'm coming to casting.	3	2
- We're going right to casting? - You don't have to if you don't want to.	3	2
I understand why you like this, but it's not for you.	3	2
- I'm the one who'd be buying Patio. - You're not fat anymore.	3	2
Thank you.	3	2
Let's assume we can't talk them out of the name,	3	2
and let's assume we can get a girl who can match Ann-Margret's ability	3	2
- to be 25 and act 14. - Is that what she's doing?	3	2
Is it just a knockoff? Are we allowed to make fun of it, at least?	3	2
- She's fun and sexy. Don't be a prude. - Would you say that to me?	3	2
- It's sexy, and it's what they want. - Clients don't always know what's best.	3	2
When we land them, you can start talking to them that way.	3	2
Pick it up. Bobby, back away from the stove.	3	2
We're out of Melba Toast.	3	2
 Jesus, Betts, have some oatmeal. That baby's gonna weigh a pound.	3	2
Carla must have had some, because I would have thrown the box away.	3	2
Are we gonna collect the whole set?	3	2
I thought you didn't mind her doing the legwork.	3	2
You didn't need a decorator last time. I'd like to feel like I'm paying for something.	3	2
- These are $3 apiece, you know. - And I can't really judge by a picture.	3	2
I'm late.	3	2
We should really spend a day in Tarrytown. It'd be so easy.	3	2
- No. - Those stores smell bad.	3	2
We are going to Tarrytown.	3	2
And you're gonna stare at some antique chair for so long	3	2
the buttons are gonna seem interesting, and then we'll go to Carvel.	3	2
See you tonight.	3	2
What are you doing?	3	2
I hope you received the package showing our campaign	3	2
to ease the way for the Ravenswood nuclear power facility.	3	2
It was very impressive.	3	2
I've told Paul that you're facing an onslaught of negative public opinion	3	2
in your attempt to demolish the Pennsylvania Railroad Station this year	3	2
and replace it with the new Madison Square Garden.	3	2
We should have torn the damn thing down during the newspaper strike.	3	2
No one would have noticed.	3	2
Now, let's take a look at the landscape, as it were.	3	2
"""How to kill a city. Architects' inhumanity to architects"	3	2
"""surpasses understanding. The new design is also ambitious,"	3	2
"""pedestrian and dull."""	3	2
Ada Louise Huxtable is as green as that folder.	3	2
People know that she's an angry woman with a big mouth.	3	2
Who writes for The New York Times.	3	2
I don't care if she wrote for the Ten Commandments.	3	2
She's trying to sell papers doing what they always do. Making people miserable.	3	2
My great-great-grandfather, Silus Dikeman, would have turned his boat around	3	2
if he had known that this city would one day be filled with crybabies.	3	2
So what's your best weapon against lunatics?	3	2
Fifteen stories, vaulted ceilings, pink Milford granite columns.	3	2
I don't think it's crazy to be attached to a beaux-arts masterpiece	3	2
through which Teddy Roosevelt came and went.	3	2
I've met the opposition. I know crazy.	3	2
Do you know where the greatest Roman ruins are?	3	2
They're in Greece, Spain, because the Romans tore theirs all down.	3	2
They took apart the Colosseum to build their outhouses.	3	2
This is the Colosseum. Have you seen the plans?	3	2
In The New York Times.	3	2
- Do you have a problem, buddy? - He's looking for an angle.	3	2
You know those snide ad men you see in the movies?	3	2
Right here.	3	2
Well, I've got a mailbox full of death threats from beatniks like him	3	2
who'd rather live in a teepee.	3	2
This is the greatest city in the world. If you don't like it, leave.	3	2
Well, we'll let you know.	3	2
You have no problems with an atom plant on the East River,	3	2
- but this bothers you? - It's Penn Station. This city has no memory.	3	2
Out with the old, in with the new. Who says that's a good idea?	3	2
I'm going to have to talk to Don about this.	3	2
Don't do that.	3	2
Look, now they'll trust me more when I help them.	3	2
Do you ever listen to yourself?	3	2
I hate you, you know that. Other than Wilma Flintstone,	3	2
I haven't seen anyone carry so well.	3	2
It's smoke and mirrors. I've busted plenty of seams.	3	2
Well, it makes me optimistic.	3	2
Greg has made it perfectly clear that come July 1	3	2
and he's chief resident, I'd better watch out.	3	2
- Hello, Mrs. Draper. - Can you get Mrs. Draper a glass of water?	3	2
Why don't you tell me first how long I'm going to be here?	3	2
What's so urgent? London Bridge falling down?	3	2
In a manner of speaking.	3	2
- I appreciate you stopping by. - Didn't you just call us into your office?	3	2
Well, yes. I thought it best if I told you in person.	3	2
I just heard from London.	3	2
We've been sacked by Campbell Soup, Great Britain.	3	2
I don't want to have to walk down here every time we lose an account.	3	2
This is an advertising agency. I'll wear out the carpet.	3	2
It's not so much the account we lost as the account we failed to gain.	3	2
- So now BBDO has all of Campbell's Soup? - Why didn't we have a meeting with them?	3	2
Perhaps I should drag Burt Peterson in and fire him again?	3	2
- Obviously Don would've loved a shot. - How did this slip through the cracks?	3	2
I don't usually set meetings, I attend them.	3	2
Well, if this is where we wanted to end up, we all did everything perfectly.	3	2
You ever get three sheets to the wind and try that thing on?	3	2
Mrs. Pryce is here.	3	2
Nothing to fret about, as long as there's new business. Five minutes?	3	2
- It's definitely side to side. - Is that a boy or a girl?	3	2
I'll call my mother.	3	2
Look. Princess Grace just swallowed a basketball.	3	2
- How are you, Roger? - It's not hard to adjust to happiness.	3	2
Shall we?	3	2
Good night, Mrs. Harris.	3	2
I'm in a foul mood.	3	2
Ch?teau Lafite Rothschild, '49. I'm very impressed that you have this.	3	2
Not bad at that.	3	2
- Where are you living? - We have a furnished flat in Sutton Place.	3	2
Three bedrooms, spectacular view of the river.	3	2
And we're near the UN, so there's plenty of Africans.	3	2
Like the Bordeaux grape, may we all get better with time.	3	2
This is delicious.	3	2
Rebecca was curious if you knew anything about schools.	3	2
In the city, I'm a little out of touch.	3	2
How long have you been together?	3	2
- Ten years. - Nine years.	3	2
Fifteen for us.	3	2
- Do you miss London? - God, yes.	3	2
But what we lost in London we gained in insects.	3	2
J. Walter Thompson is opening an office in Caracas.	3	2
I don't know if the ladies want to talk about that.	3	2
No, of course not.	3	2
The coquilles. Brilliant.	3	2
Look, I didn't want to be there any more than you did.	3	2
It was just the cherry on top of my sundae.	3	2
What?	3	2
Tell me now, and not three seconds after I've dozed off.	3	2
I've been trying to get my father on the phone.	3	2
Of course I called William and, again, something's wrong.	3	2
Another stroke?	3	2
- Gloria left him. - Can you blame her?	3	2
Yes, I can blame her. She came into his life,	3	2
he suddenly takes ill and she abandons him.	3	2
Maybe she realized he's a son of a bitch.	3	2
Don, I'm worried about him.	3	2
He doesn't sound right, and I can't take a car trip now.	3	2
I think William and Judy should bring him up this weekend.	3	2
- Great, more antiques. - It's spring break. It'll be nice for the kids.	3	2
- Those girls are a nightmare. - They'll leave by Saturday at the latest.	3	2
Why did you even bother asking me?	3	2
She's really kicking.	3	2
- Mr. Sterling, your family is here. - Send them in.	3	2
If it isn't fall bride.	3	2
- Where's Brooks? - He'll be along.	3	2
- Would anyone like anything? Coffee or... - It's 10:30.	3	2
Sherry, if you have it.	3	2
I told Brooks to come late. I don't want him to be embarrassed.	3	2
By what? That I'm paying for everything? You just tell him that's the way it's done.	3	2
No, Roger, it's about Jane.	3	2
What about her? It was her idea to take you to Dior.	3	2
Why haven't you returned her calls? You're hurting her feelings.	3	2
I know what you think.	3	2
You think it's so uncomfortable that I won't even bring it up.	3	2
Well, you're being very dramatic for a girl who didn't want a wedding at all.	3	2
Do you want me to say it? Do I have to say it?	3	2
Say what, exactly?	3	2
I've suggested to Margaret a compromise. You and June host your own table,	3	2
- and I'll be at the Hargroves'. - So, you get the in-laws and I get Siberia?	3	2
Are you worried about an odd number? Because I'll get your mother a date.	3	2
- I have a date. - Who?	3	2
- Bruce Pike. - What does that old saddlebag want?	3	2
I didn't want to go to her wedding, but I did.	3	2
- The least she can do is not come to mine. - Not come?	3	2
- That's why I suggested a compromise. - You're not even giving Jane a chance.	3	2
Seeing her on my wedding day is gonna ruin it.	3	2
She's young enough to be my sister. How does it look?	3	2
- Sweetheart. - Brooks! Thank God.	3	2
Mom.	3	2
- How are you, sir? - Not great, Brooks. Not great.	3	2
Can I get you something?	3	2
- No. - That's okay. I'll have yours.	3	2
- Roger. - We're not married anymore, you know.	3	2
I like the silver and the bells.	3	2
Go with the bells. November 23rd. I'll tell Jane.	3	2
Mr. Pryce is here to see you.	3	2
Send him in.	3	2
Your wife is charming.	3	2
- She lifted Rebecca's spirits inestimably. - I'm glad to hear it. They really hit it off.	3	2
I hate to send you into the lion's den, but I think it best you take the gentleman	3	2
from Madison Square Garden to a nice lunch today.	3	2
Peter and Paul rubbed him very much the wrong way.	3	2
- I told you before, Roger's the lion tamer. - Roger will join as well.	3	2
It will help if you tell me who these people are.	3	2
All I could secure was Edgar Raffit,	3	2
vice president of Madison Square Garden, and he's irate.	3	2
What does he want?	3	2
A Cyrano de Bergerac to make New York fall in love with him.	3	2
- Today? - Do you have plans?	3	2
Have Campbell send over the folder.	3	2
They're wild Indians.	3	2
They've been cooped up since Woodbridge.	3	2
I fixed some lunch.	3	2
- Cold roast chicken, or I have cold cuts. - We went to Pat's Steaks.	3	2
I got you a half.	3	2
- Have you all already eaten? - No, we waited.	3	2
- I even got Gloria a chicken parmesan. - Well, great. We'll mail it to her.	3	2
She's in Boca Raton. She's not coming back.	3	2
He understands completely. He's just playing it up.	3	2
- How was the drive, Daddy? - In the Lincoln?	3	2
You should take your Coumadin with your sandwich.	3	2
"So I said to them, ""It's so crowded in here, I feel like I'm on the subway."""	3	2
I've never seen anyone like you on the train.	3	2
Well, my husband won't let me. It's a figure of speech.	3	2
Have a seat, and I'll let Mr. Pryce know that you're here.	3	2
Sorry about that. I got tied up.	3	2
What else do you have to do today? What else do you have to do all week?	3	2
I barely made it here.	3	2
"Ginger presses the buzzer, says, ""Your family's here."""	3	2
Sounded silly. Gibson, up. That's gonna help.	3	2
To my knees, Don. They're bringing me to my knees.	3	2
- Sorry to hear that. - I made my bed, I should lie in it, right?	3	2
Your words, not mine.	3	2
Like it's not hard enough losing my little girl to that kid.	3	2
I've got her mother pouring poison in her ear.	3	2
There's a land grab going on.	3	2
I blame Mona.	3	2
All of a sudden, I could give two craps about that wedding.	3	2
- All I want to do is win. - Gentlemen.	3	2
- A pleasure to meet you. Roger Sterling. - Edgar Raffit.	3	2
- Our creative director Don Draper. - Edgar.	3	2
Have a seat, please. Let's get you fixed up.	3	2
I only have a minute.	3	2
Edgar, please. Eat our sweetmeats, drink our wine.	3	2
I understand one of our copywriters took a Yetta Wallenda-sized misstep.	3	2
The girl, the tightrope walker.	3	2
They got her off the sidewalk with a hose last week.	3	2
The point is, we completely understand your problem.	3	2
- All we want to know is how we can help. - You're supposed to tell me.	3	2
Well, I've done all I can. Don?	3	2
In the interest of time, you want to demolish Penn Station	3	2
- and New York hates it. - Not all of New York. A vocal minority.	3	2
Can they stop it?	3	2
Well, I think all the hubbub is making it unpleasant for...	3	2
But they can't stop it, can they?	3	2
Why do you people insist on making us sound like villains?	3	2
Your concern over public opinion shows a guilty conscience.	3	2
Now what good is that serving you if what is to be done is already underway?	3	2
Leave those.	3	2
Bring a couple of iceberg wedges, blue cheese, bacon.	3	2
So let's say I don't have a guilty conscience.	3	2
Good. And let's also say that change is neither good or bad, it simply is.	3	2
It can be greeted with terror or joy.	3	2
"A tantrum that says, ""I want it the way it was,"""	3	2
"or a dance that says, ""Look. It's something new."""	3	2
- Would you draw the line at 50%? - I'm not drawing a line at all.	3	2
PR people understand this, but they can never execute it.	3	2
If you don't like what is being said, change the conversation.	3	2
What is that conversation?	3	2
I was in California. Everything is new, and it's clean.	3	2
The people are filled with hope. New York City is in decay.	3	2
But Madison Square Garden... It's the beginning of a new city on a hill.	3	2
- Just like that? - It's true, isn't it?	3	2
If I were to come to you, I don't want that kid on my account.	3	2
- The communist, the radical. - I will handle it personally.	3	2
Grandpa Gene is going to watch his program now.	3	2
I just want to catch the end of the game.	3	2
- Move. - And the first pitch of the ball, outside.	3	2
- Daddy seems well. He has an appetite. - He eats constantly.	3	2
When I found out Gloria was gone, I was hoping he ate her.	3	2
- How could you not know about that? - I went by, but he lied to me.	3	2
Then, finally, when I let myself in, he went bananas.	3	2
He's ashamed.	3	2
Judy can get through to him.	3	2
He's down in the dumps, but he seems very clearheaded.	3	2
That's not true, Judy, and you know it. He's angry, and he's in and out.	3	2
There is this place, the Parker Home. It's midway between us, in New Brunswick.	3	2
And what happens there?	3	2
He lives there. It's got everything, plus doctors.	3	2
It's expensive, but I thought maybe we could sell our house.	3	2
You know. That would give him enough to live on.	3	2
That's very generous.	3	2
- Do you think he belongs in a home? - Betty, I know I don't get a vote.	3	2
- Neither does Don. - All you care about is the house.	3	2
You want to walk in there, see Daddy on the bottom of the stairs,	3	2
"and have his last words be, ""Take the house."""	3	2
Fine, Betts. What's the solution?	3	2
Those homes are for people who don't have families, William.	3	2
- He's a lonely old man and he's not well. - He's your father.	3	2
- Gene. - Thanks for the ritzy accommodations.	3	2
You're an army man, Gene. Drop your socks and grab something.	3	2
Lights out at 8: 15. I'm impressed.	3	2
I wish you would hang your coat up downstairs. It's covered with soot.	3	2
- How bad is he? - He's not the problem.	3	2
What am I saying? He's the whole problem. That, and William's never-ending bullshit.	3	2
- What now? - He wants to put him in an old folks' home.	3	2
Well, I understand it's not ideal, but it is the next logical step.	3	2
Don, he just wants the house.	3	2
He keeps nailing himself to the cross. For all I know, Judy's pushing him.	3	2
Cut it out!	3	2
What do you want to do?	3	2
How can he talk that way to me in the condition I'm in?	3	2
- Do you want anything? - Just throw it on the chair and stay here.	3	2
Be careful.	3	2
I'm fine.	3	2
It's so funny how she is. My father and her fought constantly.	3	2
She never remembers that part.	3	2
- Family is important to her. - I care about family.	3	2
You know, Don had nobody at their wedding. Nobody at all.	3	2
Why can't we just move in with him? I'll take care of him.	3	2
It's bad enough to work for him. I'm a 30-year-old man.	3	2
I don't want to have somebody tell me I have the wrong tie on.	3	2
Raffit is sending over every piece of paper they have on the new Garden.	3	2
He wants you to see these new drawings. Apparently they're right out of Metropolis.	3	2
- He talk about television? - I have a meeting on the books.	3	2
He talked a lot about radio. And Kinsey.	3	2
You're gonna have to keep a low profile on this,	3	2
- but it doesn't mean you're not working. - Mr. Pryce is here to see you.	3	2
I didn't realize you were in the middle of something.	3	2
Did you come to treat us to a little new-business lunch?	3	2
May I speak with you in private, Don?	3	2
- Can I get you anything? - No, thank you.	3	2
Bad news, I'm afraid. I just got off the phone with London.	3	2
There's a problem with Madison Square Garden.	3	2
- Did their check bounce already? - Unfortunately, there's a conflict.	3	2
Did you tell them it's a stadium in the middle of New York City?	3	2
- It's one of a kind. - They know exactly what it is, a project,	3	2
and they told us to turn it down.	3	2
- I'm confused. - It's a question of economics.	3	2
Servicing Madison Square Garden will require an account man,	3	2
at least two copywriters, two artists,	3	2
an ombudsman for City Hall, all against 200,000 in billings.	3	2
That's for right now.	3	2
Precisely. From what I understand, groundbreaking is at least two years away.	3	2
Madison Square Garden is our way into the World's Fair,	3	2
the largest trade show in history.	3	2
Plus, there's the Garden itself. Hotels, concerts, sports.	3	2
- This could mean 30 years of business. - They're not interested. I'm sorry.	3	2
You told me to go out and get this account. I did. I did my job,	3	2
and now you're telling me it's all for nothing	3	2
because you forgot to check with your boss first? Who's running this place?	3	2
I know this is difficult. I take full responsibility.	3	2
Why the hell did you buy us in the first place?	3	2
I don't know.	3	2
Tell Mr. Campbell Madison Square Garden is dead.	3	2
- Do you have a second? - Can it wait?	3	2
No.	3	2
Sal sent up the storyboards.	3	2
- What is this? - It's Patio, the diet drink for Pepsi.	3	2
Yes. Everyone wants a drink that sounds like a floor.	3	2
This is Chinese.	3	2
It's all one shot, like the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.	3	2
- I haven't seen it. - Well, this is an Ann-Margret type.	3	2
Fine.	3	2
You really haven't seen it? You see everything.	3	2
We have a few versions of a song,	3	2
and the boys are very excited about finding this girl.	3	2
I'm sure.	3	2
Don't you find her voice shrill?	3	2
She's throwing herself at the camera. It's pure.	3	2
It makes your heart hurt.	3	2
No one seems to care that it speaks to men, not the people that drink diet drinks.	3	2
What do the geniuses at Patio want?	3	2
Maybe we should be talking about how this is better than coffee or Dexedrine.	3	2
It's not about making women feel fat.	3	2
"This is, ""Look how happy I am that I drink Patio."	3	2
"""I'm young and excited and desperate for a man."""	3	2
I don't mind fantasies, but shouldn't it be a female one?	3	2
Peggy, I know you understand how this works.	3	2
Men want her. Women want to be her.	3	2
- Even if that's true... - It is.	3	2
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.	3	2
Well, you know, if we were making a movie or a play,	3	2
we'd be embarrassed to do this. It's phony.	3	2
You're not an artist, Peggy. You solve problems.	3	2
Leave some tools in your toolbox.	3	2
Could you hold that?	3	2
- Heading home? - Yes.	3	2
Let me ask you something. You're a young girl.	3	2
Excuse me?	3	2
You're the only one around here who doesn't have that stupid look on her face.	3	2
What does that mean?	3	2
What would your father have to do for you to not want him at your wedding?	3	2
- My father passed away. - There you go. You'd do anything.	3	2
Hello.	3	2
It's so crowded in here, I feel like I'm on the subway.	3	2
Where's your drink?	3	2
Don. Don't worry about this. It's under control.	3	2
- Hey, where's Mom? - She's upstairs.	3	2
- I'm going out for a bucket of chicken. - What's the matter?	3	2
- I'm a horrible daughter. - No, you're not.	3	2
William says these are the options. We put him in a home,	3	2
or they move in with him and Judy is his nurse. Judy.	3	2
William says?	3	2
He's probably right.	3	2
- William! - Yeah, Don?	3	2
Go get the chicken in a minute.	3	2
Can I speak to you a minute?	3	2
- Jesus. What year is this from? - I don't care.	3	2
Look, Don, we're all upset.	3	2
One thing I've learned from this, don't get old.	3	2
- About your father... - Man's a real jackpot.	3	2
He always said he didn't want to be a burden, yet here we are.	3	2
This is what's going to happen.	3	2
You're gonna explain to your sister and your wife	3	2
that we have reached an understanding.	3	2
You are going to support your father financially,	3	2
and I am going to take him into my house. His house will remain untouched.	3	2
I appreciate the advice, Don. I'll take it under consideration.	3	2
You're gonna go out there and you're gonna tell your sister	3	2
that this is what you want.	3	2
We'll pretend that you did the right thing on your own.	3	2
- He's my father! - And he's in my home.	3	2
I want you to leave tonight, and I want you to leave the Lincoln.	3	2
- I can't have him here without a car. - Are you kidding me?	3	2
How are we supposed to get home?	3	2
New York Central. Broadway Limited from Penn Station.	3	2
It leaves in two hours.	3	2
You want him? You got him.	3	2
- Dad, we have to talk. - I could eat.	3	2
No. Daddy, William has something to say.	3	2
All of us, we've been trying to figure out a way we can help you live better.	3	2
I'd be doing all right if people left me alone.	3	2
Daddy,	3	2
- Don and I want you to live here with us. - Elizabeth.	3	2
Honey, I'm not that blue.	3	2
Just for a while. I think you need a little vacation.	3	2
So the animals are running the zoo?	3	2
We're not selling the house, and you're gonna have your car.	3	2
The plans, the plans, the plans you make.	3	2
You know you want to get out of town. You'll be with the kids.	3	2
Betty is a better cook. You always say that.	3	2
- Well, I should've been the first to go. - Daddy, don't talk like that.	3	2
We should go pack. Girls, start getting your things together.	3	2
It's nice, right? It's called a stinger.	3	2
- I don't know what's in it. - It's delicious.	3	2
I'm graduating from Brooklyn College next month.	3	2
- What are you studying? - What?	3	2
- What are you studying? - Do you want one?	3	2
- I'm afraid you're gonna bite my hand. - I'm sorry.	3	2
I just need to eat. My mom says I'm still growing.	3	2
I gotta work on my manners.	3	2
I started pre-law, but switched to engineering. More jobs.	3	2
Really? Those are so different.	3	2
You've gotta figure, if we're all gonna be replaced by machines,	3	2
might as well be a guy that makes them, right?	3	2
Or you could just become a robot.	3	2
- Are you in school? - I work at an ad agency, Manhattan.	3	2
Wow. I don't know how you girls do all that typing.	3	2
- And I work for a jerk. - We're hitting the road. You got cab fare?	3	2
What are you talking about? I live around the corner.	3	2
That's right. He does.	3	2
You're funny.	3	2
Do you have... You know.	3	2
- What? - A Trojan?	3	2
No.	3	2
I can't.	3	2
Jeez. It's getting pretty late.	3	2
Well,	3	2
there are other things we could do.	3	2
Did you hear that?	3	2
Gene.	3	2
The heat is on. We got to get rid of this stuff.	3	2
You got anything else around, go flush it.	3	2
- You're leaving? - I have to work tomorrow.	3	2
- You want to get breakfast? - It's the middle of the night.	3	2
- Where do you work again? - Madison Avenue.	3	2
Right.	3	2
Well, you know, I hang out at that place a lot.	3	2
Okay.	3	2
It's the bottom one.	3	2
Thanks.	3	2
This was fun.	3	2
Parents, friends, and family, I'd like to welcome you all to field day.	3	2
I hope you can appreciate how hard the children have prepared	3	2
in all kinds of weather.	3	2
Scott?	3	2
"""The tradition of the maypole dates back over 500 years,"	3	2

- Do you want to talk about Pampers? - What do you got?	3	2
And after that, I played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet.	3	3
And after that I played Dorine the maid in Tartuffe by Moli?re.	3	3
And I guess that's it.	3	3
Thank you, Hillary.	3	3
I'd love it if you could do the twist one more time.	3	3
Thank you, Hillary. We'll let you know.	3	3

Bacardi's coming in on Tuesday to see if Daiquiri Beach has legs.	3	3
Don wants copy Monday morning and art Monday night.	3	3
- We should probably have the whole team. - This weekend? No.	3	3
I'm sorry, but we just heard about it.	3	3
 - Bullshit. - I have plans. I really do.	3	3
Well, I would love to work all weekend, but I'm just a spectator.	3	3
Whose crack did it fall through?	3	3
Because you are going to spend the weekend being our slave.	3	3
- No finger-pointing. - The bad news is	3	3
they need five more vacation situations for Bacardi rum.	3	3
The good news is we're going to be out of your hair.	3	3
Jane and Roger Sterling's garden party on the island.	3	3

Are any of you wearing seersucker?	3	3
I don't want to look like a barbershop quartet.	3	3
- You're all going? - I really wish I wasn't.	3	3
Well, then don't. Give me your glasses. I'll go as you.	3	3
Sorry about that.	3	3
 - Good luck, gentles. - Sorry.	3	3
You know, we all started at the same time.	3	3
- I've been here six years longer than you. - They hate creative.	3	3
My goodness. I didn't expect to see you here.	3	3
- For a little while longer. - Lovely to see you, Jane,	3	3
I mean Mrs. Sterling.	3	3
I'll catch up with you, girls.	3	3
I just stopped by. Roger had my rings resized.	3	3
I keep losing weight. Where are you living now?	3	3
Same old place, but we're looking. We're thinking about Riverdale.	3	3
It's near Columbia Pres and Greg wants a yard.	3	3
I don't know. I get a nosebleed anywhere above 86th Street.	3	3
- God, it's so great to see you. - Likewise.	3	3
Joan, I have a tiny favor to ask you.	3	3
They're doing construction in front of the building	3	3
and my driver's gonna be circling,	3	3
so if you could have one of the girls run down at 1:15 and flag him down.	3	3
Hello, Ginger.	3	3
Olive, from now on, there's no need to include Mr. Crane in casting.	3	3
Of course. And I brought you tea and coffee.	3	3
I'll just have whichever one you don't want.	3	3
I... Coffee. That's what I usually drink. That's what I've been drinking, right?	3	3
Well, Lola said you don't like a second cup of coffee	3	3
because it makes you edgy.	3	3
I want you to forget everything Lola told you.	3	3
I left for an hour to go get the nylons for tomorrow,	3	3
and look what happened.	3	3
Carla said he thought he was on KP duty.	3	3
- We don't have to go, you know. - I said we would.	3	3
It's Roger and Jane.	3	3
I want to go. I bought a dress.	3	3
"""The warmth of the climate disposed the natives"	3	3

- Gene. - Hello, Don.	3	3
- How's Babylon? - Bedtime.	3	3
It's all right. Go wash your teeth.	3	3
You just wait. All hell's gonna break loose.	3	3
Good night, Grandpa Gene.	3	3
- Like that. - Paul Kinsey with a two-stroke lead.	3	3
- What is your secret? - I use Harry Crane's paddle	3	3
and I pretend that's his fat head.	3	3
What kind of fruit do you put in this?	3	3
- It's rum and Coke. I don't know. - A cherry? All we have is olives.	3	3
New drinks, new copy or both?	3	3
Bikinis that match the drinks and new copy. Something cute.	3	3
"""It's Bacardi-licious. """	3	3
"""It's Bacardi-lightful. """	3	3
We're supposed to sit here and pretend like we're on vacation?	3	3
- They're probably drinking mint juleps. - Booze puts me to sleep.	3	3
I will take grass any hour of the day. It helps me think.	3	3
When I was at Princeton, I wrote my senior thesis	3	3
on the passions of the Stoics.	3	3
Mary Jane was my muse.	3	3
Paul helps me sleep.	3	3
Peggy, go get a blender. Maybe we can turn this into a frapp?.	3	3
- You get it. - I'm eating.	3	3
Olive?	3	3
- What are you doing here? - Well, if you're working, I'm working.	3	3
- It's okay for you to go home. - I already canceled my plans.	3	3
Phil and I were going to drive up to The Cloisters.	3	3
And Steven, my son, he's at Boston College.	3	3
He was thinking of coming down with his girlfriend,	3	3
but I'm not sure that's working out. He's picky.	3	3
Anyway, so Phil's taking a trip to the dump, and here I am, no worse for wear.	3	3
Don't I seem as important as Cosgrove?	3	3
I mean, Campbell makes sense, to the manner born.	3	3
- So you like to get high? - Whenever I can.	3	3
My cousin used to know someone, but he got married.	3	3
Who's your friend?	3	3
A guy like you? There must be somebody you can call.	3	3
Yeah. No. Of course.	3	3
Sally, get up here.	3	3
I just walked backwards all the way from the living room.	3	3
Zip.	3	3
You look pretty.	3	3
I look like an open umbrella.	3	3
Grandpa says you're going to a soir?e.	3	3
Don't bother him.	3	3
Go watch TV.	3	3
- Grandpa? - I'm indisposed.	3	3
What are you doing? You're going to break it.	3	3
- Who told you that? - I've done it.	3	3
If it happens, I'll go get my little screwdriver and put on a new one.	3	3
Jesus, I stink.	3	3
I can finish up out here. You take a nice, long bath.	3	3
No. No, no, no. Ettinger goes at the head of the table.	3	3
He's the chief of surgery. It's where he always sits.	3	3
Not in your home, Greg. Host at the head, hostess at the foot	3	3
or whichever is nearest to the kitchen,	3	3
- and then it's boy, girl, boy, girl. - Who says?	3	3
Emily Post. Everyone.	3	3
Ronald Ettinger does not read Emily Post. He's going to expect to sit there,	3	3
and he's going to expect me and Rick Stolich to be his footstools.	3	3
Well, I won't have their wives think	3	3
you have a wife who doesn't know how to set a table.	3	3
Joanie, I don't want to have a fight right now.	3	3
Then stop talking.	3	3
A buffet would be slightly more casual and people could sit where they will.	3	3
And we could put the chafing dish that they gave us right in the middle.	3	3
Perfect.	3	3
Hey.	3	3
...urged by Republicans to appoint a special prosecutor	3	3
to investigate the scandal-ridden State Liquor Authority.	3	3
The governor has expressed confidence...	3	3
Carla.	3	3
Carla?	3	3
Is she here?	3	3
Look at you.	3	3
I know I look good for my condition, but I'm still in my condition.	3	3
- Did they leave yet? - No, I think they're in the living room.	3	3
Well, I've been robbed.	3	3
I had it right here and now I don't.	3	3
Daddy, what are you talking about?	3	3
I had $35. Now I have $30.	3	3
- Are you sure? - Mr. Hofstadt,	3	3
why don't you go sit down and we'll all look for it?	3	3
You'll look for it, will you?	3	3
Daddy, you know how forgetful you are.	3	3
I'm missing $5.	3	3
I'll give you $5.	3	3
Don, will you give him something?	3	3
- Here, Gene. Here you go. - No, I don't want your money.	3	3
You people, you think money is the answer to every problem.	3	3
No, just this particular problem.	3	3
Daddy, I'm sorry. I don't know what you want.	3	3
I want my $5!	3	3
Well, I think I am finally ready to go.	3	3
Come on, let's go out in the yard.	3	3
I forgot how many tourists there are in midtown.	3	3
They're like vermin.	3	3
Jeffrey, this is my colleague Smitty.	3	3
- How you doing, Jeff? - Not bad. Not bad at all.	3	3
- So what do you have for us? - What do you want?	3	3
I've got Dexies, Benzedrine strips, boo.	3	3
Probably get you junk if you really wanted it.	3	3
- How do you know each other? - Jeffrey's an old friend.	3	3
You're looking at the two great cocksmen of Princeton '55.	3	3
The times you must have had. Can we buy some dope?	3	3
I'll give you all four for $10, plus delivery.	3	3
I'm just kidding, but I should. I mean, you never call me.	3	3
When's the last time I saw you?	3	3
- Give me your sweater. - It's mohair.	3	3
- May I? - Relax. Sit down.	3	3
You ever look out this window?	3	3
It's beautiful.	3	3
Nice to see you both. Isn't this something?	3	3
Betty, you remember Trudy.	3	3
Harry Crane. My wife, Jennifer.	3	3
Ken Cosgrove. We've met.	3	3
- Nice to see you all again. - When are you due?	3	3
Any minute. Can't you tell?	3	3
That last month was the worst,	3	3
- but of course this is your second. - Third.	3	3
- How old is yours? - Eight months. Beatrice Grace.	3	3
Should we take a tour?	3	3
- I grew up in a club just like this. - Me, too.	3	3
That portly fellow in the glen plaid, second at DuPont.	3	3
The one next to him, Pan Am.	3	3
Don't hand out your card.	3	3
- Now you're getting ridiculous. - Maybe it fell out of your pocket.	3	3
- It didn't. - Well, I didn't take it.	3	3
- I didn't say you did. - Not yet.	3	3
Will you stop it, Viola?	3	3
My name's not Viola. It's Carla.	3	3
Do you know Viola?	3	3
We don't all know each other, Mr. Hofstadt.	3	3
Done looking already?	3	3
Really?	3	3
- Are they still here? - Yes, they're in Mr. Kinsey's office.	3	3
I know what they're doing. You don't want to go in there.	3	3
- What are they doing? - All I'm saying is,	3	3
they obviously don't want to work, so you should just go home.	3	3
I love the commercials where the dog runs right up to the bowl of food.	3	3
How do you make him do that?	3	3
- You starve him? - So you two got a lot of girls?	3	3
Shit.	3	3
Is that that old lady again?	3	3
- Let me in. - Go away.	3	3
It stinks out here.	3	3
Come in quick.	3	3
What are you doing?	3	3
I know what you're doing. Who are you?	3	3
Jeffrey Graves, Princeton, '55.	3	3
Look, I need it for inspiration.	3	3
It's Saturday, for God's sake.	3	3
You can go home. We'll do the work.	3	3
Are you kidding? We'll end up with nothing.	3	3
I've got some ideas we can kick around,	3	3
but you're gonna have to tell me your name, sweetheart.	3	3
I'm Peggy Olson, and I want to smoke some marijuana.	3	3
You won't like it.	3	3
How do you know what I'll like?	3	3
You never ask me how I feel about anything	3	3
except brassieres and body odor and makeup.	3	3
I'd like to know how you feel about a lot of things.	3	3
- Jesus. Give it a rest. - Come on.	3	3
Just like a strong cigarette.	3	3
Can you believe this?	3	3
The sun shines bright	3	3
On the old Kentucky home	3	3
'Tis summer	3	3
And the darkies are gay	3	3
The corn top's ripe	3	3
And the meadow's in the bloom	3	3
While the birds make music all the day	3	3
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor	3	3
All merry, all happy...	3	3
Can we go?	3	3
What about the horse race? What about supper?	3	3
Don't disappear. I want to dance.	3	3
And my old Kentucky home	3	3
Good night	3	3
I did this at home for her with a little shoe polish.	3	3
She thought it was a scream.	3	3
I love it.	3	3
Weep no more	3	3
my lady	3	3
Oh, weep no more today	3	3
Can I get an old-fashioned?	3	3
We're on the same mission.	3	3
This bar looks like it was set up by a blind man,	3	3
and there's no bourbon.	3	3
There's a hole at the end here.	3	3
I don't have a lot of time.	3	3
- Rye okay with you? - You look like you know what you're doing.	3	3
I'm Connie, by the way.	3	3
Don.	3	3
Service always this good around here?	3	3
- You're not a member either? - No, no.	3	3
Nice piece of property, though.	3	3
Who are you hiding from?	3	3
I am at work disguised as a party.	3	3
I'm at work disguised as a wedding.	3	3
I hate other people's weddings.	3	3
- Why's that? - Make me nervous,	3	3
all those expectations.	3	3
And these poor kids in here,	3	3
that is a match made in the boardroom.	3	3
When I was a boy,	3	3
there was a mansion on the river I used to paddle by in my johnboat.	3	3
Twinkling lights, violins, girls giggling about something.	3	3
It's different inside.	3	3
- Where you from? - San Antonio, New Mexico,	3	3
before it was a state. Don't ask me that. Old.	3	3
You look fit.	3	3
You ever see	3	3
A Midsummer Dream with Mickey Rooney?	3	3
A Midsummer Night's Dream?	3	3
By golly, you're prickly.	3	3
I'm Republican, like everyone else in there,	3	3
but somehow, no matter how expensive my cufflinks,	3	3
I feel like I've got the head of a jackass.	3	3
Where I grew up, there was a roadhouse.	3	3
It boasted live music. That meant a drum, a bass	3	3
and a player piano with nobody at it.	3	3
I parked cars.	3	3
Fancy people would go there.	3	3
They'd get loud, they'd get drunk, but they wouldn't let me use the toilet.	3	3
So when nature called, I'd open up a trunk and relieve myself.	3	3
- You didn't. - I was 15.	3	3
There's probably some kid out there doing it to us right now.	3	3
Where you come from?	3	3
Pennsylvania by way of Illinois.	3	3
We lost our farm, ended up in coal country.	3	3
And here you are.	3	3
A pleasure to meet you, Don.	3	3
Hell of a cocktail.	3	3
Rum. Have some.	3	3
Some rum?	3	3
If you were feeling it, you'd be hungry.	3	3
I am hungry, but it's not worth moving.	3	3
She is a riot. Makes me wish I had a job.	3	3
Bacardi Eisenhower.	3	3
What are you laughing about?	3	3
You do have a job, Jeffrey. You're a drug pusher.	3	3
What is that, an English accent?	3	3
It's a little different than freshman year.	3	3
Kinsey was a real Jersey.	3	3
I guess that's why they have scholarships.	3	3
Get out.	3	3
You're arrogant. And you know what else? You can't sing.	3	3
Take it back.	3	3
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here not to fight.	3	3
Take it back, Graves.	3	3
Fine. I guess they kicked you out of the Tigertones because you were too tall.	3	3
Graves...	3	3
We're done here.	3	3
And by the way, I left the 'Tones because I had mono.	3	3
Fine. Why don't you sing a little and let them be the judge?	3	3
I am so high.	3	3
I wish you were waiting for me.	3	3
So who are you waiting for?	3	3
A friend.	3	3
What is that like?	3	3
I don't know.	3	3
I don't think about it.	3	3
Right now, it's uncomfortable, mostly.	3	3
But it moves around in there.	3	3
It does.	3	3
I'm going to blame this on martinis, but... May I?	3	3
She's not moving now.	3	3
Who are you waiting for?	3	3
My date.	3	3
You can't show up to these things stag,	3	3
but then you run into people.	3	3
I apologize. There was a line for the mirror and I feel like I'm melting.	3	3
No trouble at all.	3	3
I hope they start playing some real music. I'm in the mood to dance, aren't you?	3	3
Martinis.	3	3
Please, don't stand on ceremony. Dig in.	3	3
I'll cut the cheese.	3	3
What are you laughing about?	3	3
Everything is some private joke with them.	3	3
What were you giggling about the other day?	3	3
- A code pink. - What's that?	3	3
They put a call over the PA	3	3
whenever there's an attractive unconscious female.	3	3
I've never heard of that.	3	3
- Me either. - Sounds like where I work.	3	3
- I'm gonna check the roast. - You need a hand?	3	3
- I don't think so. - Nonsense.	3	3
- Allow me. - Thank you.	3	3
Thanks.	3	3
You really have a lovely place.	3	3
I'm glad you like it. I did most of it myself.	3	3
You must do well.	3	3
It's not easy. Not that I'm complaining.	3	3
You think they make no money now?	3	3
You should've seen back when Ronald and I were first married.	3	3
I taught kindergarten and made three times what Ron did.	3	3
We lived in a pit.	3	3
But one day you'll look back on this time and smile.	3	3
Just don't get pregnant.	3	3
Excuse me?	3	3
The last thing you want right now is a child.	3	3
I told her the same thing, but she doesn't listen. She's a nurse.	3	3
You do what you want.	3	3
If Greg becomes chief resident, then things will get easier.	3	3
The fact that Greg can get a woman like you	3	3
makes me feel good about his future, no matter what happens.	3	3
Bobby, Sally, suppertime!	3	3
You have to eat something.	3	3
You don't tell me what to do.	3	3
You either eat or you don't eat, but there'll be no more of that.	3	3
I told you I'm not hungry.	3	3
- I want my money. - You don't even know that you lost it.	3	3
Maybe you should lie down. Sally!	3	3
Grandpa, is this it?	3	3
Grandpa, is this your money?	3	3
I don't know. Let me see it.	3	3
Yeah, that's it, all right.	3	3
Well, that's a relief. Sally, your food's getting cold.	3	3
Excuse me.	3	3
Why, thank you.	3	3
He's pretending like we didn't have a fight on the way over.	3	3
He seems amenable right now.	3	3
I warned him that with this set	3	3
there was a good chance one of my old beaus might appear.	3	3
- And yet they didn't. - Which is a relief.	3	3
I don't want to. All I have to talk about is work, which is verboten.	3	3
Well, that's nonsense. You're very charming.	3	3
Come on. I'll talk.	3	3
They want to know we're having a good time.	3	3
Well, we're really having a good time.	3	3
Haven't seen you two on the dance floor.	3	3
I don't move that well right now.	3	3
Don loves to dance,	3	3
but I think I'm disappointing him because I don't feel like it.	3	3
Your asses are going to wear out those chairs.	3	3
Roger.	3	3
Don, Betty, this is Henry Francis and...	3	3
Sherry Ardmore.	3	3
Henry works in the governor's office.	3	3
Don Draper. This is my wife, Betty.	3	3
Hank, tell them where you were this afternoon.	3	3
- Roger... - They're gonna read about it in the paper.	3	3
He just came from Pocantico. Rockefeller married Happy.	3	3
She just got divorced a month ago. She has four children.	3	3
You see? That's the first reaction.	3	3
Divorce is political hari-kari.	3	3
Now we'll be stuck with Goldwater.	3	3
The primaries are still a long way off.	3	3
- Why did Rocky marry her? - They're in love.	3	3
We're going to dance.	3	3
Betty, Don, are you sure you're not up for it?	3	3
I have got to bring a date next time.	3	3
"""This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends"	3	3
"""This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper"""	3	3
We got it. You're educated and you sang in the Tiger...	3	3
- What are they called? - Tigertones.	3	3
I went to the University of Michigan.	3	3
I went to Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.	3	3
Can you believe her?	3	3
I keep thinking about rum, and I keep thinking about Cuba,	3	3
and I keep thinking about how we're all going to die.	3	3
- We almost died. - But we didn't.	3	3
How about something about life?	3	3
Let's go on the roof.	3	3
And do what?	3	3
Think about Daiquiri Beach. We need five more situations for rum.	3	3
On the roof is a good idea, actually. A hammock right between the clotheslines.	3	3
And you still say Daiquiri Beach.	3	3
Are you working?	3	3
I think so.	3	3
You both can leave.	3	3
I'm in a very good place right now.	3	3
You left your purse in your office, unattended.	3	3
- Someone could have stolen it. - No one's here.	3	3
You think I don't know what you've been doing in there?	3	3
- I don't know what to say. - I've got nothing to hide.	3	3
Well, you're free to do whatever you want, but you're not thinking about your future.	3	3
The thing is,	3	3
I have a job.	3	3
I have my own office with my name on the door,	3	3
and I have a secretary. That's you.	3	3
And I am not scared of any of this.	3	3
But you're scared.	3	3
Oh, my God. You're scared.	3	3
Don't worry about me.	3	3
I am going to get to do everything you want for me.	3	3
I'm going to be fine, Olive.	3	3
I really am.	3	3
Your expense report is ready for your review. It's on your desk.	3	3
I need you to get the Dictaphone set up,	3	3
and I need a glass of water, and then you can go.	3	3
That's very pretty.	3	3
Thank you.	3	3
- When are you due? - Early September.	3	3
You and the First Lady.	3	3
Well, I think she looks a lot better.	3	3
You could dress like that.	3	3
Go to Lord & Taylor and ask for my friend Bunny Appelle.	3	3
- She'll take care of you. - You really know everything, Joan.	3	3
Honey, would you talk to your husband?	3	3
I don't know what I'm going to do next year.	3	3
He is going to be a tough act to follow.	3	3
Those people in Texas will be crawling all over you.	3	3
If I ever need a pneumonectomy, that's the man.	3	3
You heard me say it. Great hands.	3	3
Look, Greg, it's a complicated operation.	3	3
Christ, that's not what I meant.	3	3
- It happens. - What happened?	3	3
I don't like to worry Joanie about those kinds of things.	3	3
Come on. Everyone gets a bad result every once in a while.	3	3
You know what? Enough shop talk. This is not civilian conversation.	3	3
Do you want to play charades?	3	3
- Come on. You're terrible. - No, I'm not.	3	3
Well, Joanie has many, many talents. You should play for them.	3	3
- No. - Come on. I'll go get it.	3	3
- You're all gonna love this. - What do you play?	3	3
I am out of practice.	3	3
- Come on, Joanie. - Wonderful!	3	3
Come on, just sing a little something.	3	3
It'll be just like the olden days.	3	3
We used to sit in the parlor after supper.	3	3
My mother would play the piano while we read.	3	3
Just let me have another bite and then we can go.	3	3
I guess we're the last ones to eat. That's what my mother always said.	3	3
Family holds back.	3	3
You shouldn't be filling your plate. You're the hostess.	3	3
- I'll get you some food. - Come on. Come on.	3	3
- You should sit down. - Okay.	3	3
Oh, my God! You're pregnant.	3	3
- You're so beautiful. - Thank you.	3	3
Don't you just love looking at her?	3	3
Aren't they a beautiful couple?	3	3
I knew you two would get back together.	3	3
I never had any doubt, no matter what the problem was.	3	3
I'll take care of her.	3	3
You don't like me.	3	3
I'm a nice person.	3	3
What's going on here?	3	3
I should've eaten something.	3	3
Will someone please get her a glass of milk?	3	3
Don, can I talk to you for a second?	3	3
What the hell was that?	3	3
Your wife's drunk.	3	3
I don't know what I did to get under your skin.	3	3
Roger, it's late.	3	3
You know, my mother was right.	3	3
It's a mistake to be conspicuously happy. Some people don't like it.	3	3
No one thinks you're happy. They think you're foolish.	3	3
You know, that's the great thing about a place like this,	3	3
you can come here and be happy, and you get to choose your guests.	3	3
Good night, Grandpa.	3	3
Get in here.	3	3
Sit down.	3	3
Where were we?	3	3
"""The rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory"	3	3
"""and was insensible of such happiness"	3	3
"""soon disgusted the delicacy of his subjects,"	3	3
"""and the effeminate Orientals could neither imitate nor admire"	3	3
"""the severe simplicity which Julian always maintained"	3	3
"""and sometimes affected. """	3	3
I don't care if it's windy or rainy,	3	4
there's no reason for a shake roof to fail if it's laid right.	3	4
Except that one.	3	4
No flashing around the chimney. That's gonna cost them.	3	4
Go around!	3	4
Now, I'm gonna push it up to 25 miles an hour.	3	4
That's what we're allowed to do here. You've got to really pay attention.	3	4
Fifteen minutes of news and nothing about the Holy Father.	3	4
He's still dead, Ma.	3	4
- The shower cap hold up? - Yes.	3	4
Piece of junk.	3	4
 If you want, I'll have Gerry come over and fix your shower.	3	4
It was fixed, but I think Ronnie the super sneaks in and breaks it.	3	4
For all I know he's going through my things right now.	3	4
You don't like getting a little bit of attention?	3	4
Anita, this man does not look the way you want him to.	3	4
I'd offer you a room, but since Mom moved in, I don't have it.	3	4
I want to move to Manhattan.	3	4
Really? It's so far away.	3	4
It is far, and I commute almost two hours total every day, five days a week.	3	4
- That's an extra week of work each month. - My goodness. I never thought of that.	3	4
Pegs, the rents there, they're outrageous.	3	4
I know, but I'm already spending a fortune between subway fare,	3	4
cab fare on late nights,	3	4
pantyhose... If I can't find a newspaper, the cane on the seats destroys them.	3	4
 And it'll be easy with that savings and a roommate.	3	4
Jeez Louise, you've really been thinking about this.	3	4
Ma, it's not good for it!	3	4
Why don't you move in here and we send her to Manhattan?	3	4
You gonna be one of those girls?	3	4
I am one of those girls.	3	4
Well, Ho-Ho, I observed your wishes for secrecy, but now is the time.	3	4
Gentlemen.	3	4
Imagine the perfect mixture of athletics, spectacle and speed.	3	4
Jai alai.	3	4
Jai alai is like handball, only you fling the ball	3	4
and catch the ball with this basket thing.	3	4
It's more complicated than that. And dangerous.	3	4
I'll leave the loose-leaf, but it shows the way jai alai attendance is growing.	3	4
In seven years, it'll eclipse baseball.	3	4
Go ahead, you can laugh,	3	4
but it's got the same fingerprint as baseball, only better.	3	4
A special stadium called a fronton,	3	4
and you can sit real close, which is a thrill because the ball goes 175 miles an hour.	3	4
And it's got Patxi. He's Babe Ruth, only handsome.	3	4
This is Patxi.	3	4
I was looking for boxers, but I bought his contract instead.	3	4
- He's the greatest player in the world. - Mel Ferrer.	3	4
I'm terrified of him catching balls in the face.	3	4
So, let's say there's enough money.	3	4
How would you chop it up?	3	4
Well, most of it's going to end up in television.	3	4
Perfect, because I want a TV show.	3	4
- A sports show? - Did you see Patxi?	3	4
You don't see him flying around the world, solving crimes and banging broads?	3	4
Harry has excellent relationships with the networks.	3	4
- Well, it'll probably have to be ABC. - No, no.	3	4
I want to be on all the networks, like when the President addresses the nation.	3	4
Tuesday night, 8:30 to 9:00, all three networks, the same show.	3	4
- No one's ever done it. - Because...	3	4
That's true.	3	4
How about a star-studded big musical special with a jai alai match.	3	4
- Desi Arnaz. - What else you got?	3	4
- Well, there's print. - Women's magazines.	3	4
A glamorous night in Miami with a free admission.	3	4
- Tuesday night is ladies' night. - And, of course, newspapers are key,	3	4
but you can't limit yourself to less than 10 markets.	3	4
This is impressive.	3	4
- Don't get up. - Horace, this is Don Draper.	3	4
- I told you he'd be stopping by. - Well, don't let me interrupt.	3	4
So far, for the jai alai campaign,	3	4
Sterling Cooper will produce an adventure program	3	4
starring your handsome fellow, a musical spectacular...	3	4
On all three networks, and it has to be in color.	3	4
CBS doesn't have color.	3	4
Fine. I'd like to get the ladies' magazines in color,	3	4
and maybe a color page in the Sunday paper.	3	4
- What about radio? - You'll have to take radio the way it is.	3	4
I don't think it's worth anyone's time unless you're willing to commit to at least	3	4
- $1 million, to start. - Sure, but that's a third of my ad budget.	3	4
Well, as they used to say at the freshmen mixer,	3	4
"- ""When you get a yes, you go home. "" - Only, Humps, you never got one."	3	4
Listen, Draper, I'd love to buy you dinner, run some slogans by you.	3	4
Actually, Ho-Ho, we buy you dinner.	3	4
That was fun.	3	4
I'm going to have to buy Campbell a case of something.	3	4
Patxi.	3	4
During the Depression, I saw somebody	3	4
throw a loaf of bread off the back of a truck.	3	4
It was more dignified.	3	4
Are you going to have trouble sleeping tonight?	3	4
I've seen clients far more defenseless than he.	3	4
"Well, as the Bible says, ""Enjoy your fatted calf. """	3	4
Campbell, did you tell him who this idiot's father is?	3	4
He said he's a shipping magnate, not a client.	3	4
Horace Sr. Is connected to Bert Cooper in a million ways,	3	4
and I don't know if he would like what just happened in there.	3	4
You want to run it by his daddy?	3	4
He's my age. So he was born with a lot of money.	3	4
He has a dream, and it's our job to make it come true.	3	4
Well, there you have it.	3	4
Nicely done, my boy.	3	4
Elizabeth. Get off your feet. It's bad for the baby.	3	4
- As soon as I finish the dishes. - Sit with me.	3	4
Cleaning up for the maid. You're just like your mother.	3	4
I don't like watching you commit suicide. Neither do your kids.	3	4
What do you want, Daddy?	3	4
It's all laid out in here,	3	4
my arrangements. Just follow the directions.	3	4
I don't want to talk about this.	3	4
We talk about it now and then we don't talk about it. That's the idea.	3	4
- Fine. - Jesus. Smoke your cigarette.	3	4
Funerals are a dishonest business.	3	4
People don't want to think about it. That's how they get you.	3	4
Remember what happened with your mother?	3	4
The will's translucent or transparent or something according to the lawyers.	3	4
You run the show.	3	4
- You took me in. - Anything else?	3	4
I want you to have your mother's coats.	3	4
I gave Judy the Hudson seal, but I want you to have the chinchilla	3	4
and obviously the mink.	3	4
They're in the cedar closet. They key's in Gloria's end table.	3	4
Okay, Daddy.	3	4
You don't want to hear about it, Scarlett O'Hara?	3	4
I have the folder.	3	4
You've always been sensitive. That's my fault for shielding you	3	4
from all the dangers out there. That's probably why you married this joker.	3	4
If you'd even known what was possible...	3	4
But that's that. I wrote it down. We never have to talk about it again.	3	4
I don't understand why you like talking about this	3	4
when you can see so clearly that it upsets me.	3	4
You're being selfish and morbid.	3	4
I'm your little girl.	3	4
And I know it must be horrible to be looking at whatever you're looking at,	3	4
but can't you keep it to yourself?	3	4
- What kind of mood is he in? - I'm never right.	3	4
- Anybody been outside? Do I need a coat? - I'd take it.	3	4
Don, George Caan dropped out of Patio to direct a picture in LA.	3	4
I look forward to his average work. Replace him.	3	4
There's no time and there's no talent.	3	4
What were you gonna do if you had to fire him?	3	4
- Have Sal do it. - Are you serious?	3	4
- Sal, do you want to do it? - Of course I do.	3	4
It sounds good, but it makes me very nervous.	3	4
It's lifted straight from Bye Bye Birdie. It's a single shot.	3	4
Sal did the storyboards. I could go on, but I don't think I should have to.	3	4
- Allison? - Keens chophouse.	3	4
Thank you, Don.	3	4
Tag. You're it.	3	4
Hey. You don't want to cut towards yourself.	3	4
There we go. Get down. I've got some great things in here.	3	4
This is an exact imitation of the Gettysburg Address.	3	4
- You know about Honest Abe? - He learned to read by candlelight.	3	4
That's right.	3	4
Well, I'll be.	3	4
Don, look at this.	3	4
Victory medal, France.	3	4
I should have another for beating the clap.	3	4
Here we are.	3	4
Wow!	3	4
That spike, it's Prussian.	3	4
Germany's greatest soldiers. You had to respect that.	3	4
That's where I got him.	3	4
- You see that? Dried blood. - You shot him?	3	4
I think so. I shot lots of them. They were trying to kill us.	3	4
- War is bad. - Maybe,	3	4
but it makes a man out of you.	3	4
Living off the land, battling the elements, standing alongside your brothers.	3	4
- Ask your pop. - Gene.	3	4
- What? - Gene, don't.	3	4
- Come on. - Bobby, give it back.	3	4
Let him have it! That's why I got it!	3	4
- Can't I have it? - There was a person in that helmet.	3	4
- An enemy. - Bobby, it's a dead man's hat. Take it off.	3	4
Keep it on. It's yours.	3	4
There was this girl...	3	4
You like? It was on sale at A&S.	3	4
Looks like a lot more than 20% off.	3	4
Kitty.	3	4
Kitty.	3	4
I'm working.	3	4
- Something's wrong, isn't it? - No.	3	4
No, no, no, don't say that. Don't say that.	3	4
- I'm not myself. - What does that mean?	3	4
Why are men so embarrassed to share their emotions?	3	4
Please. Sal...	3	4
The past few months... Something's wrong.	3	4
- Well, that's not true. - It is true.	3	4
You know, I don't need that much, but...	3	4
I do need tending.	3	4
- I'm so sorry. - Well, what can I do?	3	4
You won't even tell me.	3	4
Make some excuse.	3	4
For the last six months, maybe a year, even, I've watched my job disappear.	3	4
Nobody wants illustrations anymore. It's all about photography.	3	4
And yes, I've been nervous.	3	4
And now I have this opportunity	3	4
to do something that really does have a future.	3	4
So it's been building to this, and tomorrow you will triumph	3	4
and come home a conquering hero.	3	4
- What's wrong with you? - Well, I do have one horrible flaw.	3	4
I love you.	3	4
I don't want to fail.	3	4
Just... With a single mistake, the entire shot is ruined.	3	4
So what? You've seen the movies. Take two. Take three. Do it again. Action.	3	4
It's one shot, the whole thing.	3	4
- It's the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie. - I'm trying to remember.	3	4
She starts singing against a blue background,	3	4
and her voice is very girlish.	3	4
- Yes. Yes, I remember that. - And she's offering us this can of Patio.	3	4
And she's on a treadmill, but you can't see it.	3	4
- She's walking back and forth? - No, no. She walks towards you.	3	4
The wind is blowing in her hair,	3	4
and she sings about how Patio is low in calories.	3	4
And then she extends her hand out and she waves goodbye.	3	4
Then we move back, too,	3	4
but she stops, and she takes her dress in her hands	3	4
and she runs forward as fast as she can. But then she turns her back	3	4
and looks seductively over her shoulder.	3	4
The treadmill pulls her back again and she comes towards you one last time,	3	4
dancing right up to the camera. She sort of pushes her shoulders together	3	4
"and leans over with the can and she smiles. ""Hello, Patio. """	3	4
Something like that.	3	4
Sound good?	3	4
You're gonna do great.	3	4
- You really think so? - Yes.	3	4
Don, I'd like you to meet Horace Cook.	3	4
- We've met. Lincoln Center. - Of course.	3	4
Have a seat. Lane has brought it to my attention	3	4
that Mr. Cook's son has approached us for work.	3	4
Actually, it was Don who thought it best, out of deference, to include you.	3	4
We're not psychiatrists. There is no confidentiality.	3	4
That's not strictly true, but you are family and, well, it appears to be a lot of money.	3	4
Bert seemed alarmed. What exactly happened in this meeting?	3	4
- Well, you know, your son has a dream. - Yes, jai alai.	3	4
When he first mentioned it I assumed he was gambling,	3	4
but he seems convinced of its financial potential.	3	4
And there's no reason to doubt that.	3	4
Are you drunk? It's like Polish handball. You can't even play it if you're left-handed.	3	4
There's no wall on that side.	3	4
Well, then, that's done with. We needn't be involved.	3	4
Bert, you know that's not the way the marketplace works.	3	4
A man comes through your door,	3	4
he knows what he wants, he's got the money to back it up,	3	4
- you do your best. - Perhaps I'm unclear	3	4
because I'm childless, but they're not.	3	4
Well, should you be lucky enough to strike gold,	3	4
remember that your children weren't there when you were swinging the pick.	3	4
I've seen his plan. It's gibberish.	3	4
But if you refuse him, he'll only find someone else.	3	4
My son lives in a cloud of success,	3	4
but it's my success.	3	4
Perhaps when that evaporates and his face is pressed	3	4
against the reality of the sidewalk, he'll be of value to someone.	3	4
"""Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten. """	3	4
That's how I was raised.	3	4
So you want us to proceed?	3	4
When we put that money aside for him, he was a little boy.	3	4
We didn't know what kind of person we were making.	3	4
Don't be so hard on yourself.	3	4
Easy for you to say. He doesn't have your name.	3	4
You'll stay for lunch. No discussion.	3	4
A pleasure to see you again.	3	4
Pleasure.	3	4
- I'll sign him tonight. - Very good.	3	4
These are ideas.	3	4
You can skip some if you want to, but do not go out of order.	3	4
Hello, this is Margaret.	3	4
Hello, my name is Elaine and I'm 22,	3	4
and I have a good job and I'm interested in a roommate, too.	3	4
Well, it's nice to speak with you, Elaine. Where do you work?	3	4
Well, I live in Teaneck, New Jersey,	3	4
so I want to be in this city to be near my job.	3	4
- I work in a tannery on the West Side. - Really? They make leather?	3	4
I'm a secretary,	3	4
but I am around animal skins and carcasses most of the day,	3	4
so I don't keep pets. The smell makes them go crazy.	3	4
I don't know if the West Side is what I had in mind.	3	4
I need someplace near a major hospital.	3	4
My face is very badly burned	3	4
and I need frequent prescriptions for unguents and salves.	3	4
- It would have to be two bedrooms. - Two bedrooms is good.	3	4
Now, about the bathroom,	3	4
I'm going to need some help there.	3	4
Who is this? You know something? You're a jerk.	3	4
- Why do you do that? - I've got a salt tooth.	3	4
- It's right here in the back of my mouth. - Grandpa.	3	4
It's getting harder to fool you. I got two spoons.	3	4
Mommy doesn't let us have ice cream before dinner.	3	4
Is she afraid you're going to be fat like she was?	3	4
Your grandma Ruth used to drive her to town to run errands	3	4
and make her walk herself home. That put a stop to it.	3	4
- You remember Grandma Ruth? - She gave me a ukulele.	3	4
- Did you learn it? - No.	3	4
You can, you know. You're smart.	3	4
You remind me of your grandma more than your mother.	3	4
You know, she did drafting in the 20s for this engineer.	3	4
- A little bald man. He wasn't a threat. - That's good.	3	4
You can really do something. Don't let your mother tell you otherwise.	3	4
You know, she won't let me eat this either, and I don't want to be the only one,	3	4
so I'll tell you what. I'm gonna keep a lookout.	3	4
Okay. Go ahead. The coast is clear.	3	4
- She's coming! Quick, hide it! - I knew you were gonna do that.	3	4
This tastes like chocolate, but it smells like oranges. You smell that?	3	4
A year from now there'll be nothing but rum and Mexican beer in this place.	3	4
- You ever have Mexican beer, Humps? - I don't drink a lot of beer.	3	4
You have to when you're there. Amoeba, dysentery.	3	4
Patxi caught a bug, lost eight pounds. That's a lot on his frame.	3	4
Ho-Ho was saying a photo of Jack Kennedy enjoying jai alai	3	4
would be a tremendous endorsement.	3	4
My father hates Kennedy,	3	4
'cause he knew Old Joe when they were criminals together.	3	4
Plus, Dad's against integration. He called Patxi a wetback.	3	4
Jack Kennedy certainly ended up with a better job than his father.	3	4
I know this idea sounds crazy, but read your history.	3	4
I've got a 50% chance, at least.	3	4
My father's dead, but I know he'd be interested.	3	4
This is his kind of investment.	3	4
I think about the way my father made his fortune,	3	4
renting ships for troop transport during the war.	3	4
He didn't care about the Germans.	3	4
And then I think, I could really do something.	3	4
I might not be president, but I could... I could build something.	3	4
And people will like it, and I'm going to be the father of this sport,	3	4
and people are gonna be dying to do business with me, even my father.	3	4
I have this image in my mind.	3	4
It's his 75th birthday,	3	4
and I give him a team.	3	4
I want to give you a piece of advice.	3	4
I've been doing this a while, and I applaud your enthusiasm,	3	4
but I think you should take this decision a little more seriously.	3	4
- What are you saying, Don? - Let him... Let him talk.	3	4
You have a great fortune, and that's not just money. That's the future.	3	4
And we will take all of your money, I promise you,	3	4
but I think you should reevaluate this particular obsession.	3	4
You can do better.	3	4
That's a sales technique, isn't it?	3	4
You zig away from me and I zag back into your arms.	3	4
You know, I've got the galleys of this book by Ogilvy.	3	4
Learned a lot about advertising.	3	4
Then why aren't you eating dinner with Ogilvy?	3	4
'Cause Campbell talked me out of it.	3	4
Now let's get one thing straight.	3	4
If jai alai fails, it's your fault.	3	4
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.	3	4
Don't apologize. Everybody thinks that. Nobody says it.	3	4
Are you removing that or moving it?	3	4
Did everybody in Manhattan decide I'm not allowed to live here?	3	4
No. Actually, I think the right girl could have a very good effect on you.	3	4
I do, however, find your ad unfortunate.	3	4
It's perfect. I proofed it thoroughly.	3	4
"""Clean, responsible, considerate."	3	4
"""I have some nice furniture and a small television. """	3	4
It reads like the stage directions from an Ibsen play.	3	4
So what, then? You'll give me some ideas,	3	4
and I'll use them, and you'll all have an even bigger laugh?	3	4
No, I thought I'd tell you how to get a roommate.	3	4
This is not the way.	3	4
Fine.	3	4
Please, Joan, tell me how to do it.	3	4
"- For one thing, why ""Margaret""? - It's my name and it's more adult."	3	4
But this is about two young girls in Manhattan. This is about an adventure.	3	4
Am I wrong?	3	4
If this were me, I would say something like,	3	4
"""Fun-loving girl, responsible sometimes."	3	4
"""Likes to laugh. Lives to love."	3	4
"""Seeks size six for city living and general gallivanting."	3	4
"""No dull moments or dull men tolerated. "" Or something like that."	3	4
Well, thank you. That's very helpful.	3	4
And don't put it up there. Everyone here knows you.	3	4
Branch out.	3	4
Good night, Peggy.	3	4
Don. There you are.	3	4
I was just on my way over to Lane. I've got signatures.	3	4
Horace Cook, Jr. Is all dressed and ready for the oven.	3	4
In light of all of the trepidation,	3	4
perhaps you should deliver this to Lane yourself.	3	4
- Are you following me? - I spent two years at Dartmouth	3	4
hiding him from shylocks. Let me enjoy my payday.	3	4
Mr. Hooker, has Lane stopped by the clubhouse?	3	4
I'll go and get him.	3	4
That's called a cesta. It's made of reeds from the Pyrenees.	3	4
The ball is called a pelota. They just sent all this over.	3	4
So did Horace have any more ideas?	3	4
For one thing, he wants us to call it the NJAA.	3	4
National Jai Alai Association?	3	4
"He has no idea how confused America's gonna be about that ""J."""	3	4
Look at this camaraderie.	3	4
Perhaps we've discovered America's pastime after all.	3	4
Full steam ahead.	3	4
- Bravo, boys. - How about Patxi: The Motion Picture?	3	4
God, I wish I was a part of this.	3	4
I've informed the home office. There was a flutter of adding machines.	3	4
Well, you heard him, boys.	3	4
Don't stop until you see the whites of his pockets.	3	4
Cosgrove.	3	4
Good God.	3	4
Bill it to the kid.	3	4
- What the hell is that? - It's an English muffin.	3	4
The hell it is. Put it away. You can eat at school.	3	4
I already ate my breakfast.	3	4
Well, don't keep me waiting this afternoon.	3	4
I want you dressed and ready for ballet at 3:00 on the button.	3	4
- No dawdling. - Okay.	3	4
I'm gonna buy fruit. What do you want?	3	4
- Peaches, please. - Peaches give me a rash.	3	4
Your sister likes them.	3	4
Are you Peggy? They just sent me back from reception.	3	4
- I'm Karen Ericson. - Yes, I am. How nice to finally meet you.	3	4
You have your own office. Wowee! At the travel agency, it takes years,	3	4
and Martha Winston's the only girl, and she's married to the boss.	3	4
Well, it's different up here.	3	4
Everyone on the first floor loved your humorous ad.	3	4
You seem like someone I could really be friends with,	3	4
not like the last girl.	3	4
Well, I'm fun and I love to have fun.	3	4
She was always keeping her door shut,	3	4
and I think you should only close your door for one reason.	3	4
What's that?	3	4
I just don't get along with women like I do men,	3	4
but she left to get married, so I must be some kind of good-luck charm.	3	4
- Do you have a steady? - No, I'm still playing the field.	3	4
There are so many interesting men out there. Except sailors.	3	4
I have a couple of rules. One of them is I don't like sailors.	3	4
- No sailors. I agree. - So, Peggy Olson, I have to ask,	3	4
- are you Swedish? Because I am. - Norwegian.	3	4
Well, we won't tell my parents.	3	4
I'll make appointments and come by at 5:00. Or do you want your girl to do it?	3	4
I finish up around 6:00.	3	4
- Well, then tomorrow? - Most days.	3	4
Can we look on Saturday?	3	4
- But not this Saturday... - You work on Saturday?	3	4
Not every Saturday. And Saturday nights never.	3	4
I'm out in the city, ready for fun.	3	4
Well, okay. I'll call you, roomie.	3	4
I got you a sandwich.	3	4
- I'm gonna walk around the park. - Well, have fun, roomie.	3	4
It's Mommy.	3	4
- Where's Grandpa Gene? - It must've slipped his mind.	3	4
- Where is he? - Probably at home.	3	4
I'm sure he'll be there when we get home.	3	4
Bye, bye, sugar	3	4
Hello, Patio	3	4
When the cake is on the plate	3	4
I'm afraid to gain the weight	3	4
But now I have some extra room	3	4
Patio, you make me swoon	3	4
Diet cola tastes divine	3	4
Get your own, 'cause this one's mine	3	4
It's the brand new slender you	3	4
Now we'll have you singing too	3	4
Bye, bye, sugar	3	4
It's great to see you go	3	4
So bye, bye, sugar	3	4
Hello, Patio	3	4
Hello, Patio	3	4
Hello, Patio	3	4
- I can't even tell you how thorough Sal was. - Well, I appreciate that, but this is...	3	4
I don't know. This is not what I thought it was gonna be.	3	4
Glad I'm not alone.	3	4
Look, I don't think there's any ambiguity about this being exactly,	3	4
and I mean exactly, what you asked for.	3	4
I know, but there's something not right about it.	3	4
- What? - I can't put my finger on it.	3	4
- I wish I could, but I can't. - It's an exact copy, frame for frame.	3	4
I'll tell you what. Why don't we send a dupe back to the office with you?	3	4
No. I'm sorry.	3	4
I wish I could explain it, but it's just not right.	3	4
I'm gonna be magnanimous and say it's our idea and our failure,	3	4
but it is a failure.	3	4
That is magnanimous.	3	4
- I'm sorry about that. - Maybe next time.	3	4
It's true. It's not right. It doesn't make any sense. It looks right,	3	4
it sounds right, smells right. Something's not right. What is it?	3	4
It's not Ann-Margret.	3	4
Mommy, there's a policeman! Hurry!	3	4
Yes, may I help you?	3	4
- Are you related to Eugene Hofstadt? - Yes, I am. What is it?	3	4
We regret to inform you that he passed away.	3	4
- Oh, God. - No! No!	3	4
I'm fine.	3	4
- What happened? - He collapsed in line at the A&P.	3	4
I'm so sorry, ma'am.	3	4
I...	3	4
I...	3	4
Well, we need to know what you'd like to do with his body.	3	4
Yes, of course.	3	4
- Mr. Romano's here to see you. - Send him in.	3	4
I figured I'd bring myself to the woodshed.	3	4
It must be horrible having a client insist on something	3	4
and then change their mind once they've seen it.	3	4
- I hope it never happens to me. - I was the director and I let you down.	3	4
- I'm in a meeting. - I have Mrs. Draper on the line.	3	4
- It's urgent. - I can go.	3	4
What's the matter?	3	4
I'm sorry, Betts.	3	4
I'm...	3	4
I'm very sorry.	3	4
Do you want me to call William?	3	4
Just stay put. I'll be right there.	3	4
- I have to go. - Is everything okay?	3	4
There's nothing you can do.	3	4
Don't ruin the only good thing to come of this.	3	4
You are now a commercial director.	3	4
How do I know you're not just saying that to make me feel better?	3	4
You'll know when I hire you again.	3	4
Allison, I'm going for the day.	3	4
Okay, Ma.	3	4
Oh, my goodness. It's beautiful.	3	4
Is that all the noise that this was? Why didn't you wait for Gerry to help?	3	4
Because he's playing cards and Peggy gets up early.	3	4
- Say thank you, Ma. - Thank you, sweetheart.	3	4
An Admiral. You must be doing well.	3	4
- I am. - What's the matter, peaches?	3	4
Sit down, Ma.	3	4
What's this about?	3	4
Don't, Anita. Stay.	3	4
Ma, I'm having problems with my apartment,	3	4
and my commute is very long and...	3	4
It doesn't mean nothing if you want to stay here with us.	3	4
Your father and I lived with grandma and grandpa for years.	3	4
Your sister was born there.	3	4
Ma, I'm getting an apartment in Manhattan.	3	4
- Well, that makes sense. - It really does.	3	4
Yeah, I guess I'm the kind of mother	3	4
who'd rather have a new TV than a daughter.	3	4
I got you a new TV because you needed one.	3	4
You got me a new TV 'cause you think I was born yesterday.	3	4
You belong in the city.	3	4
Do you see this, Anita? This is what they do. Family is cheap.	3	4
Well, take it back, okay?	3	4
Because it's just going to remind me of how stupid you think I am.	3	4
Ma! You knew she'd have to move there eventually.	3	4
Now, someday both of you are going to feel this,	3	4
this... This broken heart I'm carrying.	3	4
You'll get raped, you know that?	3	4
It's just as dangerous as here, and I'm going to have a roommate.	3	4
She's a nice girl. Her name is Karen Ericson. She's Norwegian.	3	4
- There's a man, isn't there? - No.	3	4
Why would I ever believe anything you say?	3	4
Stop it, Ma. You're being cruel.	3	4
Good night, Ma.	3	4
- That wasn't so bad. - Really?	3	4
She's been through a lot of change lately.	3	4
The Holy Father dying, that was very hard on her.	3	4
It has become one country	3	4
because all of us and all the people who came here	3	4
had an equal chance to develop their talents.	3	4
We cannot say to 10% of the population that you can't have that right,	3	4
that your children can't have the chance to develop whatever talent...	3	4
Eugene Hofstadt, number two.	3	4
Eugene Hofstadt, number two.	3	4
What does that mean?	3	4
There were two Eugene Hofstadts at his bank,	3	4
so he had to be called Eugene Hofstadt, number two.	3	4
Well, he's with Ruth now.	3	4
I hope so.	3	4
Once he asked,	3	4
"""What's gonna happen when I get to heaven and I have two wives?"""	3	4
Knowing Gloria, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.	3	4
Betts, don't eat that. It was in his car all day.	3	4
I don't care.	3	4
- Why are you laughing? - Sally, sweetheart...	3	4
- We weren't laughing, honey. - I heard you. I heard you laughing.	3	4
How can you be sitting there like nothing's happening?	3	4
Like he's not gone? He was here, now he's not here.	3	4
He's gone forever and nobody even knows that.	3	4
Stop it.	3	4
- You're being hysterical. Calm down. - He's dead!	3	4
He's dead and he's never coming back! And nobody cares	3	4
- that he's really, really, really gone! - Sally, go watch TV!	3	4
The United States army convoy was delayed by soviet border guards,	3	4
when the convoy commander rejected commands that his troops	3	4
leave their vehicles for a head count.	3	4
The Russians finally allowed the convoy to pass. Robert?	3	4
Dumbstruck police and horrified crowds gathered	3	4
as an elderly Buddhist monk set fire to himself today,	3	4
resulting in his death. The bizarre act was a protest	3	4
against the mostly Catholic government of Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam	3	4
and their supposed campaign of discrimination.	3	4
The New York Stock Exchange today saw slight gains in moderate trading	3	4
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly two points.	3	4
And now here's Stan Baker for Winston cigarettes.	3	4
I was expecting the Piersons as well, but they're not coming. Please.	3	5
My goodness. Of course. Here, take mine.	3	5
I appreciate that both of you are here.	3	5
What happened?	3	5
The children were at the water fountain during gym	3	5
and Sally told Becky Pierson she should save some for the fish,	3	5
and Becky ignored her,	3	5
and Sally hit the back of her head and her face went into the spigot.	3	5
And then Becky went after her... Hair pulling, scratching.	3	5
She didn't need stitches in the end, I understand?	3	5
This girl, this Becky Pierson, Sally told me she's a bruiser.	3	5
 She's heavy.	3	5
The children poke pencils into her sides when she's sitting	3	5
- because they think she can't feel it. - Sally doesn't do that, does she?	3	5
No.	3	5
But this bad behavior is new.	3	5
I know that you're expecting a child, but she already has a little brother.	3	5
I guess what I'm asking is, has anything changed at home recently?	3	5
My... My father passed away. Last week.	3	5
The week before... Two weeks now.	3	5
- I feel terrible for bringing that up for you. - Well, it has not been easy.	3	5
Is this Grandpa Gene we're talking about? That poor thing.	3	5
- Sally didn't mention it? - Why didn't you call us or send a note?	3	5
I don't think she missed a day. Did she go to the funeral?	3	5
- Why would we put her through that? - I don't think children belong in graveyards.	3	5
 No, of course not.	3	5
Now I realize why she was asking all those questions	3	5
- about Medgar Evers' murder. - She was?	3	5
I'm sorry.	3	5
- I have to use the ladies room again. - We can talk about this another time.	3	5
No, I'm not as upset as I look. I can't help this.	3	5
- I am mortified. - It's not a good time.	3	5
No, and it really should be, shouldn't it?	3	5
Sally does need more attention. She's grieving.	3	5
There is a very special pain to losing someone at that age.	3	5
I don't know if you can understand that.	3	5
I can.	3	5
Mrs. Draper, I was just talking to your husband and this really can wait.	3	5
Are you sure?	3	5
Because I just want to put it behind us.	3	5
I really just want everything to be okay when the baby comes.	3	5
It's going to be a beautiful summer.	3	5
"""Tipped a barman: 75 cents. Hat-check tip at bar: 50 cents."	3	5
"""Cab to restaurant: $1.12. Tipped the cab driver: 38 cents."	3	5
"""Dinner at Hausner's: $19.44."""	3	5
It's better to have a bit of Don Draper than no Don Draper at all.	3	5
I'd like that in writing.	3	5
It seems strange that the two of you went on the same overnight trip	3	5
and you put in for $70 and he put in for $82.	3	5
If I were lying, wouldn't I have made it a round number?	3	5
- Not that Don's lying. - I signed his receipts, didn't I?	3	5
Which brings us to the undocumented portion of my assessment.	3	5
The amount of pencils, pens, pads, paper and postage	3	5
that are currently being consumed suit a company four times our size.	3	5
It has also been brought to my attention that a credenza has disappeared,	3	5
a theft that I believe necessitates a conspiracy.	3	5
People forget that Karl Marx was the greatest economist who ever lived,	3	5
and whatever you think of his solution, the problem he posed	3	5
was about the catastrophic up-and-down of the marketplace.	3	5
Tell the folks at Admiral that Karl Marx says everything's okay.	3	5
"Boom and bust. Bull and bear. ""I need a TV."" ""I have a TV."""	3	5
Damn it, Paul, someone helped Ken cherry-pick	3	5
all of Burt's successful accounts and I've been left with the dogs.	3	5
- Admiral is not a dog. - Sales are flat. It's all over their memos.	3	5
And now I have to look them in the eye with nothing. Except maybe new creative.	3	5
Stop it.	3	5
Now you're interested. There are some areas of growth, and I mean literally, areas.	3	5
Atlanta, Oakland, Chicago, Detroit, Newark, DC.	3	5
Great jazz cities.	3	5
And I left out St. Louis and Kansas City, also growing.	3	5
- What does that mean? - Great jazz musicians?	3	5
Seriously, is it possible that these Admirals are being bought by negroes?	3	5
Lois caught her scarf putting paper in the Xerox.	3	5
Maybe when Joan leaves I can finally get rid of her.	3	5
Can you pretend like you're back in the media department	3	5
and tell me what this says to you? Look at the cities.	3	5
Is it possible that negroes are out-buying other people two-to-one?	3	5
You could jump to that conclusion, I suppose.	3	5
Did you hear about Lois? You got a winner there, Kinsey.	3	5
- Did you see it? - I did.	3	5
So what's everybody doing tonight? Baby. Married. Kinsey?	3	5
Do you want to go to the Mets game? Tickets and a watch.	3	5
"- Why, thank you, Birds Eye. - Does the watch say ""Birds Eye"" on it?"	3	5
"No, it says, ""Hamilton Electric. "" What time is it? What time isn't it?"	3	5
- Admiral is happy. We're happy. - They're not happy!	3	5
"""Morris, comma, in reference to retooling the factory"	3	5
"""for London Fog children's and young adults... """	3	5
I thought I'd bring you the minutes to the meeting, since you had to run off.	3	5
You're wasting paper.	3	5
I'd have to make 1,000 to keep up with your department.	3	5
They waste paper because they throw out bad ideas.	3	5
They waste paper because they use it to sop up spilled drinks,	3	5
right after their mid-afternoon naps.	3	5
You came here because we do this better than you,	3	5
and part of that is letting our creatives be unproductive until they are.	3	5
Pennies make pounds and pounds make profits.	3	5
I don't want to talk to you this way. I've tried it before and it never works.	3	5
- You're not usually this emotional. - You want to make money?	3	5
Start getting your nails dirty with Bert Cooper and Harry Crane.	3	5
Clients love to pay for media and creative needs pencils.	3	5
I suppose I hadn't necessarily thought of it that way.	3	5
And lay off of expense accounts.	3	5
Think of the men's morale, not just your own.	3	5
You've obviously seen Bridge on the River Kwai.	3	5
I've seen everything. You have my ticket stubs.	3	5
Your uncle Herman is on the line. He won't leave a message.	3	5
Uncle Herman? My goodness, is Aunt Alice all right?	3	5
- Who is this? - It's Peter. Dottie's boy. You called me.	3	5
- It's Duck. Duck Phillips. - Duck.	3	5
Sorry for the cloak and dagger. I didn't want to set off any alarm bells.	3	5
My name is Herman, you know that.	3	5
Except that I actually have an Uncle Herman and he's 91.	3	5
That's a sick joke. I apologize. It's been too long.	3	5
I don't know if you heard, but I'm at Grey now.	3	5
What's that like?	3	5
People walking around the halls all the time, laughing their heads off?	3	5
We're going to have lunch, you know.	3	5
I don't know, Duck. It doesn't sound like a good idea.	3	5
"Campbell, this is beyond ""No hard feelings. """	3	5
I won't waste your time. Haven't I always been on your side?	3	5
- When? - I'll have my girl call your girl.	3	5
I'll say it's Clorox.	3	5
Hello? Anyone home?	3	5
I'll get it. Hello?	3	5
- Mr. Draper? - Yes.	3	5
This is Suzanne Farrell, Sally's teacher. I'm not interrupting dinner, am I?	3	5
- No. - I just felt I should call and apologize	3	5
about our meeting this morning.	3	5
Why?	3	5
Well, I...	3	5
What I mean is, my father died when I was eight	3	5
and I might have overdone it, relating to Sally in that way.	3	5
I didn't mean to upset your wife, and...	3	5
I guess I can get a little caught up in things and lose perspective.	3	5
I don't know why I'm calling. I'm embarrassing myself.	3	5
No, you're fine.	3	5
- If there's anything I can do... - Don?	3	5
Betts!	3	5
Thanks for the call.	3	5
- It's time to go. - Okay, we're going. Let me get my keys.	3	5
They're in your hand.	3	5
Francine took the kids. Who was that?	3	5
No one.	3	5
If you're parked in emergency, you'll have to move soon.	3	5
First, let's make sure it's not a false alarm.	3	5
- This is my third time. - We sent you home before?	3	5
No, third baby.	3	5
Your job's done. The solarium's down the hall to the right.	3	5
Hang in there, Betts.	3	5
I came in early to cover for a friend,	3	5
so there's a chance I'll see you the whole way through.	3	5
Daddy!	3	5
You can scream and yell as much as you want in this hallway,	3	5
- but we're about to pass the nursery. - Of course.	3	5
Excuse me.	3	5
I know it's silly, but I seem to be having trouble with this pen.	3	5
- I believe it's empty. - I gotta go.	3	5
Are you planning to give the baby the breast?	3	5
- No. - Last time you ate?	3	5
Lunch. Toast, cottage cheese, pineapple.	3	5
Pineapple? What were you thinking? Anything else, sweetheart?	3	5
- Life Savers. - Has your water broken?	3	5
My water never breaks. When will Dr. Aldridge be here?	3	5
Joseph Waddell?	3	5
- I'm Dennis Hobart. - That's good to know.	3	5
I haven't seen anybody in an hour. What's going on?	3	5
- Well, we've had a shift change. - My wife, Pam, Pamela Hobart.	3	5
She's fine. The baby's breech. We're calling in a specialist.	3	5
- What? - Didn't somebody get your permission?	3	5
Damn it, what is with you people? I don't know a damn thing!	3	5
Please don't raise your voice.	3	5
Now, I apologize, but we need your permission.	3	5
- Do whatever you have to do. - We'll update you religiously. Promise.	3	5
This is not how I pictured it. Where's all the backslapping?	3	5
You know, I brought this because I thought it'd be a party in here.	3	5
- It's not, but I'll have one. - Right now?	3	5
Whenever you want.	3	5
I left work this morning. I've been here all day.	3	5
I am so bored.	3	5
I even called in. Like the prison can't run without me.	3	5
- You done this before? - Twice.	3	5
- And yet I never thought to bring a bottle. - Well, what are we supposed to do?	3	5
My daughter took forever. I remember being pretty worked up.	3	5
"And the nurse said, ""Don't forget."	3	5
"""Your wife's in the boat. You're on the shore. """	3	5
- The other one a boy? - Yes.	3	5
You throw the ball around?	3	5
Not enough.	3	5
All right, Mrs. Draper, I'm going to need you to get on the bed	3	5
so I can prepare you for delivery. This part should be familiar.	3	5
I'll shave you and then give you a quick low enema.	3	5
Well, the good news is, time has stopped.	3	5
I'd like to have a gold watch one day, but I can't, you know?	3	5
You don't want to have anything on you like that.	3	5
Would they attack you?	3	5
I knew it was just a matter of time before you started with the questions.	3	5
I bet you have a nightmare where you end up in Sing Sing, right? Everybody does.	3	5
- I do. - So what's it like?	3	5
You're outnumbered, but you got the power.	3	5
Kind of like being a king.	3	5
- Except your subjects want to kill you. - Maybe, but they don't,	3	5
'cause they know I'm dangerous, and I got a badge, which they respect.	3	5
How do they know you're dangerous?	3	5
Well, they're not all bad. There's extremes.	3	5
We've got death row and then we've got the baseball team.	3	5
In '29, they played the Yankees.	3	5
Everybody in stripes.	3	5
You're a funny one.	3	5
I tell a lot of jokes at work. You hear some doozies.	3	5
I have to watch what I do when I leave work, be careful not to bring it home.	3	5
Especially with a kid, right?	3	5
Just yesterday I was in A block	3	5
"and I thought, ""Every single one of these animals,"	3	5
"""their mother had them, they were a baby. """	3	5
"And I think, ""There they are, on the other side of the fence. """	3	5
And you know what? Every one of them would blame their mom and dad.	3	5
- That's a bullshit excuse. - That's true, Don.	3	5
You have little veins. Breathe and think about the beauty parlor.	3	5
- Do you need to call someone else in? - It's in.	3	5
The medication will help with the pain and put you in a twilight sleep.	3	5
- Where is Dr. Aldridge? - He's in the city.	3	5
He went to Mama Leone's for his anniversary. Isn't that sweet?	3	5
Is he drinking?	3	5
'Cause my Aunt Emma, her doctor was drunk,	3	5
and he ruined her bladder.	3	5
Dr. Mendelowitz, the obstetrician, is on duty and will fill in.	3	5
- I don't want him. I don't know him. - He's our top man.	3	5
I want Dr. Aldridge.	3	5
You have absolutely nothing to worry about.	3	5
I don't want another doctor. I want my doctor.	3	5
Sit back. You're at 5 centimeters.	3	5
That's halfway from here to the Hebrides and other mountain ranges,	3	5
which we are currently studying in chapter 12.	3	5
The doctor will be here and there.	3	5
The Hebrides are islands.	3	5
Try it now.	3	5
Thank you, Sister.	3	5
What do you make her for? Sixteen?	3	5
Pam was screaming at me in the car.	3	5
- I don't think that's unusual. - That's my girl in there.	3	5
If something happens to her,	3	5
I just don't know what I'd do.	3	5
And then there'd be that baby. How could I love that baby?	3	5
Our worst fears lie in anticipation.	3	5
You're so sure about that?	3	5
- I want to go home, you bitch! - Please relax!	3	5
Let go of me! Get your hands off me! Where's Don?	3	5
- He's in the waiting room. - No, she can't hear you.	3	5
The hell I can't. Where is he? Where's Don?	3	5
- He's in the waiting room. - Bullshit.	3	5
He's never where you expect him to be.	3	5
Have you seen him? Have you been with him?	3	5
Seven centimeters. She's starting transition.	3	5
Someone call him. I don't want to be here.	3	5
Push the Demerol, 25 milligrams.	3	5
I'm just a housewife. Why are you doing this to me?	3	5
Mr. Hobart? Congratulations. You have a little baby boy.	3	5
- Oh, my God. - Your wife and your baby are doing fine.	3	5
Can I go in? Can I see her?	3	5
Not right now. She lost a lot of blood and had a transfusion.	3	5
- What? Please, I have to see her. - Please, she's in recovery, resting.	3	5
But you can go to the nursery and look in at your son. It's just down the hall.	3	5
Thank you.	3	5
A baby boy.	3	5
- Congratulations. - You're all right, Don.	3	5
I'm sure yours is gonna be good, too.	3	5
You know what? I know it.	3	5
Thanks, Dennis.	3	5
You're an honest guy. Believe me. I'm an expert.	3	5
Go see your baby.	3	5
Why do they put up with us? You know, we don't deserve it.	3	5
This is a fresh start. I don't know who's up there,	3	5
so I'm saying this to you. I'm gonna be better.	3	5
I'm gonna be a better man.	3	5
Tell me you heard me.	3	5
I heard you.	3	5
Don't fight the urge to bear down.	3	5
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.	3	5
Either you can do it or we will, but it's going to come out some way.	3	5
Daddy?	3	5
- Who are you? - It's me.	3	5
I don't know you.	3	5
It's me, Elizabeth.	3	5
You do know me.	3	5
- Okay, so it's me. - What are you doing here?	3	5
- I had to go away. - Well, don't you miss me?	3	5
Of course. Listen.	3	5
Nobody knows I'm here, okay?	3	5
Am I dying?	3	5
Ask your mother. Tell her, Ruthie.	3	5
Elizabeth, shut your mouth. You'll catch flies.	3	5
I left my lunch pail on the bus and I'm having a baby.	3	5
You see what happens to people who speak up?	3	5
Be happy with what you have.	3	5
You'll be okay. You're a house cat.	3	5
You're very important and you have little to do.	3	5
- She's beautiful. - It's a boy.	3	5
You look terrible.	3	5
- How do you feel? - I need to put my face on.	3	5
You look beautiful, Betts.	3	5
- Gene. - What did you say?	3	5
His name is Eugene.	3	5
We don't have to decide that now.	3	5
Gene.	3	5
Did you get any sleep?	3	5
No, and I don't expect to for the next six months.	3	5
I wasn't sure where to put it all.	3	5
Mr. Draper's office. Please hold. It's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?	3	5
- Roger. - Dada.	3	5
- Where are you? - Down the hall.	3	5
How's Betty? She perform like a champ?	3	5
- She did. - I need his initials.	3	5
Jane's gonna put them on the back of her yacht or something for him.	3	5
No name yet.	3	5
There's a lot of guys twiddling their thumbs down in art.	3	5
- Why were you in the art department? - Lane was.	3	5
Apparently, we're all backed up. No one will move forward without your approval.	3	5
- I missed half a day. - Well, Betty had the baby, not you.	3	5
- I'll see what I can do. - Good.	3	5
That guy's a tick. See you at the traffic meeting.	3	5
Can I get some coffee?	3	5
You know what it's like in that office. No one ever buys me lunch.	3	5
- I like the turtleneck. - Really?	3	5
- Come. Join us. - What is she doing here?	3	5
Don't worry about it. I know what I'm doing.	3	5
- No, you don't. - Have a nosh.	3	5
Two months at Grey and you're already having a nosh?	3	5
I didn't know until I got here.	3	5
Look, I woke up one day and had a realization.	3	5
- You two have a secret relationship. - What? That's ridiculous.	3	5
Come on. The way you handled that Freddy Rumsen thing	3	5
so that she could move up?	3	5
I've been doing this a long time. I know what I saw.	3	5
- That's not what happened. - You can be modest if you want to,	3	5
but that kind of focused ambition is rare in advertising.	3	5
Thank you.	3	5
I want to take you both with me to the promised land.	3	5
At Grey, an account man is expected to have ideas,	3	5
and creatives are expected to be geniuses.	3	5
You'll be sitting on velvet pillows, showered with riches, awards.	3	5
- We're not going anywhere. Well, she can. - Do we have to go together?	3	5
Pete, I know you have ideas and you're a risk-taker.	3	5
Sterling Cooper is never going to reward that.	3	5
Well, thank you. Anything else?	3	5
Don't be a baby. You should be taking meetings like this twice a week.	3	5
If you want to woo me, you'll have to buy me my own lunch.	3	5
- Maybe I should leave, too. - Why would you do that?	3	5
You're so talented. You should strike while the iron's hot.	3	5
- What does that mean? - It means the sky's the limit.	3	5
No mortgage, no family.	3	5
You're a freewheeling career gal with great ideas. Am I wrong?	3	5
- I don't know. - This is your time, Peggy.	3	5
Let me ask you something, Hollis. What type of TV do you have?	3	5
- An RCA. - Really?	3	5
Color? Why did you get it?	3	5
- To watch TV. - But why an RCA specifically?	3	5
I didn't see any difference, I guess.	3	5
Sixteen. Good afternoon, gentlemen.	3	5
A lot of negroes prefer Admiral. I've done research.	3	5
I have an RCA.	3	5
- So, do your friends buy Admirals? - I'm sorry, sir. I can't really say.	3	5
Look. This is important and I'd really like to have an honest conversation with you.	3	5
I don't want to get into trouble.	3	5
- It's just us. It's just Hollis and... - Mr. Campbell.	3	5
Do you think I'm a bigot?	3	5
I just want to know why you bought your TV.	3	5
- I don't know. I don't remember. - It's your TV. It's a big purchase.	3	5
- I don't even watch the damn thing. - Really? Why not?	3	5
Why should I? We've got bigger problems to worry about than TV, okay?	3	5
You're thinking about this in a very narrow way.	3	5
The idea is that everyone is going to have a house, a car, a television...	3	5
The American dream.	3	5
- It's my job. - Every job has its ups and downs.	3	5
You don't watch baseball? I don't believe you.	3	5
- What are you doing out of bed? - I smelled something.	3	5
- What are you making? - A snack. You want some?	3	5
- I didn't know you could cook. - Mommy's much better at it.	3	5
- Are you looking for a chick? - I am.	3	5
Miss Farrell told us about that when we went to the farm.	3	5
But she says those eggs can never become a chicken,	3	5
- even though they come out of a chicken. - Why's that?	3	5
Because they're from the store.	3	5
And you know what else? If you hold an egg up and it has veins in it,	3	5
- you can shake it, then eat it. - Really?	3	5
It's called addling.	3	5
Is the baby gonna live in Grandpa Gene's room?	3	5
It's not Grandpa Gene's room. It's the baby's room.	3	5
- I thought it was gonna be a girl. - Well, I thought you were gonna be a boy.	3	5
Not all surprises are bad.	3	5
- Everything's gonna be fine. - That's what Miss Farrell said.	3	5
Well, then I guess it must be true.	3	5
Burt Peterson's firing was undignified. Building security. That's all I'll say.	3	5
Confirm a couple of rumors. Did he throw a desk chair against a window	3	5
only to have it bounce back and knock him over?	3	5
Not that I know of.	3	5
Did he make a number two in a file cabinet?	3	5
Burt Peterson lived hard and loved hard. So, Harry here is an expert in media.	3	5
- Television. The air, not the sets. - Now, Admiral Television sales are flat.	3	5
- We know that. - But as we studied your indices,	3	5
we realized that they're not flat everywhere.	3	5
In fact, among negroes, sales are actually growing.	3	5
- We know that, too. - You do?	3	5
No, of course you do.	3	5
These are your numbers, but I think we've discovered an interesting strategy.	3	5
This is Ebony.	3	5
By negroes, for negroes.	3	5
Jet. Space in these magazines costs far less than what you currently spend.	3	5
Daily newspapers that go just to this market for pennies on the dollar.	3	5
And?	3	5
Shift a portion of the media budget from lower-indexing white areas	3	5
to this market, where it can do more good.	3	5
They already like it and we can make them buy more by increasing the exposure.	3	5
A 5% sales bump in Detroit alone	3	5
would make you the same profit as a 2% increase system-wide.	3	5
And ads on television geared to this market and white markets	3	5
- will have double the effect. - A negro ad and a white ad?	3	5
So, Campbell, you're making twice the ads for us now.	3	5
No, do them together. Integrate it.	3	5
- I don't think that's legal. - Of course it's legal.	3	5
Look, this conversation is not worth having.	3	5
Who's to say that negroes aren't buying Admiral televisions	3	5
because they think white people want them?	3	5
- Miss Olson is here to see you. - Send her in.	3	5
Sorry.	3	5
I know he doesn't need clothes, but don't return it.	3	5
I'm the youngest. I never had anything new.	3	5
- You didn't have to do that. - I did.	3	5
No one told me they were all going in on it together.	3	5
I heard you were back at work, but now I wonder if that's true.	3	5
I invited you in.	3	5
I don't know if this is the best time. I don't know. It's kind of serious.	3	5
I've been thinking about my situation here,	3	5
and I'm so grateful to you for all you've done.	3	5
I just...	3	5
Well, you know, I'm paid very little.	3	5
My secretary doesn't respect me because I make $71 more a week than she does.	3	5
Maybe we need to get you a cheaper secretary.	3	5
Paul Kinsey does the same work that I do, and not as well sometimes.	3	5
And I don't know if you read it in the paper, but they passed a law	3	5
where women who do the same work as men will get paid the same thing.	3	5
Equal pay.	3	5
It's not a good time.	3	5
It's not a good time for me, Don. Do you know how expensive this city is?	3	5
It's not gonna happen, Peggy, not now. I'm fighting for paperclips around here.	3	5
Third time. It must be old hat.	3	5
- You're gonna be fine, Peggy. - I look at you and I think,	3	5
"- ""I want what he has. "" - Really?"	3	5
You have everything, and so much of it.	3	5
I suppose that's probably true.	3	5
What do you want me to say?	3	5
I don't think I could have been any clearer.	3	5
You see what's been going on here the last six months?	3	5
What if this is my time?	3	5
Hey.	3	5
- Where are you going? - To the ladies room. You want to join me?	3	5
- Did you tell Don about Duck? - That's none of your business.	3	5
Sure, they hear you're shopping around, they'll want you more, but me?	3	5
I'm sharing my job with Kenny. I'm already redundant.	3	5
You have relationships with your clients. That's leverage.	3	5
- Did you say something? - It's my decision, Pete.	3	5
Your decisions affect me.	3	5
If it isn't Martin Luther King. I should dropkick you off the roof.	3	5
Admiral Television has no interest in becoming a colored television company.	3	5
But they are. It seems illogical to me	3	5
that they would reject an opportunity to make more money.	3	5
Then again, I'm in advertising.	3	5
This is a sensitive issue. Businesses hate that.	3	5
Let me put it in account terms.	3	5
Are you aware of the number of hand jobs I'm gonna have to give?	3	5
Am I being taken off the account?	3	5
I'm going to have to pretend I had you killed!	3	5
Sales are flat. I had to do something.	3	5
I don't know if anyone's ever told you that half the time	3	5
"this business comes down to, ""I don't like that guy. """	3	5
Are we done with the flogging?	3	5
Never as good as you think it's gonna be.	3	5
If I may. Bert, Roger,	3	5
it does seem as though there's money to be made in the negro market.	3	5
Obviously not with Admiral,	3	5
but I don't think it would be wrong of us to pursue it in some way.	3	5
Really?	3	5
I've just moved here. I'm a stranger in a strange land,	3	5
but I can tell you there's definitely something going on.	3	5
We'll look into it. You can go.	3	5
- We're here! - She's here!	3	5
- Mommy! Daddy! - Mommy! Mommy!	3	5
Welcome, welcome!	3	5
Mommy!	3	5
- Careful. - Here, let me take him.	3	5
I missed you so much.	3	5
Wait till you see your fridge.	3	5
If there's a power outage, you can feed the entire street for a month.	3	5
- Hi, baby. I'm your brother, Bobby. - Remember, you have to be careful.	3	5
How was it?	3	5
You know. It was all a fog.	3	5
You're making a mistake not forcing Carla to stay.	3	5
She's been away from her family. And I can manage.	3	5
- I know some girls. - You want something to eat?	3	5
- Sure. - I got it. Come on.	3	5
Daddy, don't.	3	6
It's 10:30. Why aren't you asleep?	3	6
- I'm afraid. - Sally.	3	6
I know. You're not Thomas Edison.	3	6
What are you afraid of?	3	6
I'm afraid of what's going to happen when you turn off the lights.	3	6
I'm home now.	3	6
Nothing can hurt you.	3	6
Except maybe this mess.	3	6
Pick up your room, we'll get you a nightlight.	3	6
Okay.	3	6
 Go to sleep.	3	6
- What did you find out? - Nothing.	3	6
I bet they're gonna make us work over the holiday.	3	6
- And Cosgrove's late. - Can we have everyone's attention, please?	3	6
This will only take a moment, and it will not be repeated.	3	6
That's not true, Mr. Hooker.	3	6
We've just been informed that there will be a visit	3	6
from the director and chairman of the board of Putnam, Powell & Lowe,	3	6
the purpose of which is both friendly	3	6
and, of course, to evaluate our performance.	3	6
- Mr. Hooker. - The visit will commence tomorrow,	3	6
that is Tuesday, at 10:00 and will continue into the next day.	3	6
We apologize. We realize we were to be closed Wednesday, July 3rd, but...	3	6
Come on.	3	6
 They were unaware of the holiday.	3	6
Now we merely need that everyone continue to operate	3	6
at the height of their productivity and to make sure	3	6
that their desks and offices are shipshape and Bristol fashion.	3	6
And by no means should these preparations	3	6
interfere with our work today. Very good, then.	3	6
Don, may we have a word?	3	6
Well, isn't this perfect?	3	6
Well, we'll just move it from lunch to the end of the day.	3	6
I'm having a cake delivered. How's that going to look?	3	6
A cake for what?	3	6
Tomorrow is Joan's last day. I told you that.	3	6
But if we're working on Wednesday, wouldn't that be her last day?	3	6
I don't know why she'd come in.	3	6
Greg finds out about his residency today or tomorrow. I'm not sure.	3	6
I think they're going away to celebrate.	3	6
on the state of television, and, of course, account updates.	3	6
- Just a few minutes each. - On each account?	3	6
No, a few minutes for each of you.	3	6
And Mr. Kinsey, you might want to shave your beard.	3	6
What? Who the hell are you people?	3	6
That was a joke.	3	6
There's no need for panic.	3	6
Just think of this as the same as any major client visit.	3	6
They're flying across the ocean to have their knobs polished?	3	6
Fourth of July. Subtle.	3	6
- Get the door, will you? - The British are coming.	3	6
I assume you know what this is about.	3	6
I have a theory. I believe they're coming to see you.	3	6
Why?	3	6
They've shown a great deal of interest in you.	3	6
Ever since you swung around your privates in the boardroom with Duck last year.	3	6
They study and dissect your work, trying to decipher	3	6
what is your particular American genius.	3	6
- What do you think it is? The presidency? - No, I think it'll be a creative umbrella	3	6
with a dual position in London and New York.	3	6
- London? - Bye-bye, Don.	3	6
How congenial you two are.	3	6
I hope you can maintain this pretense when they arrive.	3	6
Excuse me?	3	6
Kiss and make up before you cost us all something.	3	6
- You're being melodramatic. - Miss Blankenship,	3	6
please make an appointment at Angelo's for Misters Sterling and Draper,	3	6
the soonest available.	3	6
- I have my own barber. - That's not necessary.	3	6
Enough. Everyone wants Martin and Lewis.	3	6
Reconcile.	3	6
Damn it!	3	6
It's done! John Deere is done. The 110 lawn and garden tractor	3	6
with snow thrower and transparent vinyl enclosure, and a key.	3	6
Look at him. He just brought in a mastodon.	3	6
Sorry I'm late.	3	6
Big accounts move slowly, but the John Deere doesn't.	3	6
Listen, Mr. Clampett. You might want to get your iron horse out of reception.	3	6
I will, after everybody sees it.	3	6
- No, P.P.L. is coming. - When?	3	6
- Tomorrow morning. - And we have to work Wednesday.	3	6
- We have to give presentations. - You got that one just in time.	3	6
Yeah, I guess I did.	3	6
She's in here!	3	6
I'm resting, and your little brother's sleeping.	3	6
All he does is sleep.	3	6
- What are you doing? - I'm bored.	3	6
- Go bang your head against a wall. - Mom.	3	6
Only boring people are bored.	3	6
- Can I pet him? - Don't wake him.	3	6
Come over here.	3	6
Go play.	3	6
You can sleep all you want, little pig in a blanket.	3	6
That is quite a shave.	3	6
I'm thinking about my toes right now.	3	6
- Go to town. - He's next.	3	6
- I already had one. - See, that's not true.	3	6
You think there's something feminine about it?	3	6
My father was the tallest, handsomest, vainest man in New York,	3	6
and he got his nails done.	3	6
He had his fourth coronary behind the wheel and hit a tree.	3	6
The windshield severed his arm,	3	6
and he was dead, so they never put it back on.	3	6
In the casket he had one hand. The nails were perfect.	3	6
- I don't believe that story. - Okay, so he hit another car and not a tree.	3	6
It's my company. Why should I be nervous?	3	6
Because you sold it.	3	6
So that's it? That's what I did to you? I got you a half-million dollars?	3	6
- I'm really sorry about that. - No one said you did anything.	3	6
You sound like Burl Ives.	3	6
Part of the problem with Mona	3	6
is that one day she just started judging people.	3	6
Never gave a crap before.	3	6
I'll tell you right now, Don. I don't like being judged.	3	6
Listen, Roger... I'm okay, Angelo.	3	6
We don't need to talk about this anymore. I promise.	3	6
I was holding out for gratitude, but I'll take that.	3	6
Thank you.	3	6
Well, maybe now you'll have the money and the glory.	3	6
Call the photographers, type service and vendors	3	6
and tell them all deliveries should come between 9:30 and 11:00	3	6
so the British can see lots of activity when they arrive.	3	6
Now.	3	6
Are you being short with me because you think it'll make parting easier?	3	6
My mother used to do that.	3	6
I'm noticing for the first time that the ladies out here are rather plain,	3	6
- present company excluded. - Well, we could hire some prostitutes.	3	6
I know your prime minister enjoys their company.	3	6
The secretary of war,	3	6
and you'd do best not to bring that up tomorrow.	3	6
- I apologize. - Well, I apologize that tomorrow's visit	3	6
will steal from your spotlight.	3	6
Perhaps we can reschedule your surprise party till after the holiday?	3	6
Why did you do that?	3	6
Do what? Mrs. Harris knows everything. I'm sure she was expecting it.	3	6
I'm going to go home and make a celebratory dinner for my husband.	3	6
And when you wake up in the middle of the night	3	6
and wonder what you forgot, don't call me.	3	6
- Well, that's smooth. - I got a shave.	3	6
- Why? - They ordered me to do it.	3	6
We have an inspection tomorrow. The British.	3	6
Well, you look very successful.	3	6
Hot or cold? Swedish meatballs or chicken salad?	3	6
Chicken salad.	3	6
Did you pick up a nightlight?	3	6
I did, and I read her to sleep. She was still clingy.	3	6
I don't remember her being that resentful of Bobby when he was born.	3	6
- I don't know that she resents him. - Well, she won't go near him.	3	6
She won't even go in his room unless I make her.	3	6
- Why are they visiting? - We don't know.	3	6
Delayed everybody's vacation plans.	3	6
He was perfect today.	3	6
- Who? - Gene.	3	6
Would you ever want to live in London?	3	6
I'm serious.	3	6
Of course. I could get a pram and a real nanny.	3	6
- What do you know? - Nothing.	3	6
Where the hell were you?	3	6
I told you I was going for drinks with the docs.	3	6
You didn't tell me anything. You didn't call me.	3	6
- I called you at work. - That's a lie. I just ate dinner for two.	3	6
Get over here.	3	6
I know you're drunk. Come sit next to me.	3	6
So what happened?	3	6
I...	3	6
I didn't get it.	3	6
What happened?	3	6
It doesn't say anything	3	6
except that they made Doug Hutchinson chief resident.	3	6
And I felt the floor open up under me.	3	6
So you'll get it next year. You knew it was possible.	3	6
I ran into Eddinger about a half-hour before the letter came,	3	6
and I could tell something was wrong. He wouldn't look me in the eye.	3	6
I figured he felt bad	3	6
and I'd at least find out what the hell happened.	3	6
- But he didn't feel bad. - What are you talking about? He loves you.	3	6
He sat me down in his office and he poured a drink and he said...	3	6
He said I had no brains in my fingers.	3	6
But he wrote you all those nice evaluations...	3	6
Damn it, Joan! Doctors don't write bad things about each other.	3	6
- So you'll go to another hospital. - Not in New York.	3	6
If I want to stay in surgery, I can go to Alabama or something.	3	6
So what happens? You're still a doctor, right?	3	6
I am.	3	6
I'm just not a surgeon, and I will never be a surgeon.	3	6
- Did they fire you? - I don't want to talk about it, Joanie, okay?	3	6
I was hoping you were asleep.	3	6
I have another year of residency. You're not gonna be able to leave your job.	3	6
- Greg, that's done. - Well, get another one.	3	6
Honey.	3	6
Listen.	3	6
You are still a doctor.	3	6
I married you for your heart, not your hands.	3	6
They all went out to celebrate.	3	6
I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't fake it.	3	6
I've been sitting in the Dublin House since 2:00.	3	6
Go lay down. I'll undress you. Just let me close the light.	3	6
Mr. Hooker, you neglected to tell me that our guests have arrived.	3	6
To what do I owe the pleasure?	3	6
This is Mrs. Harris. She was the office manager before me,	3	6
but she is off to greener pastures.	3	6
- Well, that's a shame. Guy MacKendrick. - Joan Harris.	3	6
This is Mr. Harold Ford. And you recall Saint John Powell.	3	6
- We've spoken on the phone. - I believe that's true.	3	6
I just wanted to tell you, I made a reservation at La Grenouille at 6:00	3	6
and got you two tickets to Oliver! It's a wonderful show.	3	6
I've heard that. A tragedy with a happy ending.	3	6
My favorite kind.	3	6
Thank you, Joan. Shall I give you the threepenny tour?	3	6
Please let everyone know that they're here.	3	6
We have you scheduled to meet with Sterling, Cooper and Draper,	3	6
and then with Mr. Pryce, of course,	3	6
and then a light lunch in the conference room	3	6
with the personnel you requested.	3	6
Tomorrow, the presentations and client meetings.	3	6
- Saint John, good to see you again. - Peter Campbell. This is Guy MacKendrick.	3	6
I know everything about you. You're a very impressive fellow.	3	6
- I wish I could return the compliment. - Well, perhaps one day you shall.	3	6
Good morning, gentlemen.	3	6
- Hello. - Miss Olson, one of our copywriters.	3	6
I know everything about you. You are a very impressive young woman.	3	6
Why, thank you. I was just writing copy.	3	6
- As you were. - I hope we chat later.	3	6
Mr. Draper is waiting for you in Mr. Cooper's office.	3	6
This way.	3	6
That is a very handsome man.	3	6
- Good to see all of you. - It's a pleasure.	3	6
Don, no worse for wear, I see.	3	6
What a delightful custom. From the Far East, I assume?	3	6
- Japan. - How was your trip?	3	6
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Harold Ford, and this young man is Guy MacKendrick.	3	6
Mr. Cooper.	3	6
- Mr. Sterling, what an honor. - Call me Roger.	3	6
- And you must be Don Draper. - I am.	3	6
I can't tell you how exciting it is to finally meet you.	3	6
That's very flattering.	3	6
Guy here has done a study of your work, which is quite a compliment.	3	6
You see, in addition to his inestimable charm,	3	6
Guy here has degrees from Cambridge University	3	6
and the London School of Economics.	3	6
Three years at the Bank, two years at McCann,	3	6
and his most recent coup, Mercedes-Benz.	3	6
- That's very impressive. - I apologize.	3	6
I didn't realize he was going to recite my entire curriculum vitae.	3	6
- You left out modest. - Well, we're going to debrief Mr. Pryce,	3	6
and the plan is for you to join us for luncheon.	3	6
- In the conference room at 1:00. - Sounds like Agatha Christie.	3	6
Well, apparently our tour continues.	3	6
I look forward to... How do you say? Catching up?	3	6
I as well.	3	6
Well, that was strange.	3	6
Look at that. The suspense is killing him.	3	6
Yes?	3	6
Mr. Powell and Mr. Ford are here to see you.	3	6
- Spectacles. - Right.	3	6
Send them in.	3	6
- Gentlemen. - Greetings, Saint John.	3	6
Harold, what a pleasure.	3	6
Please see to it that Guy has a space to prepare.	3	6
- Right away. - Gentlemen. There's coffee and cake.	3	6
We're very impressed, Lane. Very, very impressed indeed.	3	6
In nine months, you've trimmed every bit of excess,	3	6
increased billings, and we haven't heard a word of complaint.	3	6
Yes, well, Pax Romana and all that.	3	6
Bravo. We've decided to offer you something	3	6
that we hope you'll view as a reward and a challenge.	3	6
- Is it in the box? - In a manner of speaking.	3	6
Open it.	3	6
What is that? It looks like a snake.	3	6
Fancy that.	3	6
- Is it real? - It was.	3	6
It's for our snake charmer. We're sending you to Bombay.	3	6
Bombay? What would I do there?	3	6
Well, hopefully the same thing you accomplished here.	3	6
Where shall I put this?	3	6
I guess I needn't find a spot for it if I'm simply moving again.	3	6
Don't pout.	3	6
One of your greatest qualities is you always do as you're told.	3	6
No, it's just the logistics.	3	6
My wife just settled, my son just accepted to school,	3	6
- and now we're moving on? - Nonsense. You're moving up.	3	6
That's the spirit.	3	6
So, without further ado, I will give the floor to Guy MacKendrick.	3	6
Let me begin by offering my warmest wishes and admiration	3	6
for Lane Pryce and his exemplary work. It'll be hard to lose him,	3	6
but there's no doubt that our loss is India's gain.	3	6
Now, let me say there's no cause for anxiety.	3	6
There will be no further reductions in the ranks.	3	6
Yes, that's good news.	3	6
If I might, I'd like to walk you through this slight reorganization.	3	6
As before, P.P.L. London will be the head of this body,	3	6
and Sterling Cooper, now more than ever, our American presence.	3	6
Our business maturity with your creative edge.	3	6
A triumvirate of Don and myself and Mr. Cooper, our chairman emeritus,	3	6
will oversee three streamlined departments. Creative, art and copy.	3	6
Account management, that's Mr. Cosgrove, Mr. Campbell for the present,	3	6
and a combined television/media department headed by Mr. Crane.	3	6
Mr. Sterling's not on that chart at all.	3	6
- That's true. - Well, that was an oversight.	3	6
As you can see, nothing much has really changed.	3	6
Frankly, my presence here is just to ensure thorough communication,	3	6
that we help each other on both sides of the pond.	3	6
Whether it be a sharing of creative genius,	3	6
media savvy,	3	6
or the unbridled acquisition of new business.	3	6
I'm sure you all have a thousand questions.	3	6
But for the time being, I say we inform the troops,	3	6
so that the transition can begin immediately after the holiday.	3	6
- Shall I have Mr. Hooker prepare a memo? - No. Nonsense.	3	6
I don't want this to be the kind of place where such news is delivered that way.	3	6
Shall we?	3	6
Gosh, we're really going to miss you.	3	6
- What the hell just happened? - They reorganized us,	3	6
and you're the only one in this room who got a promotion.	3	6
- Really? - Yes, really.	3	6
I apologize for my wild imagination.	3	6
See? It's clean.	3	6
That's not what I want to talk to you about.	3	6
What's this?	3	6
It's for you.	3	6
"""For my new big sister, the best in the world."""	3	6
And my goodness, it's from baby Gene.	3	6
Look.	3	6
Baby Gene can't write.	3	6
Babies get fairies to do things. You know that.	3	6
It's really from him. I'm not kidding. I think you should open it.	3	6
- What is it? - It's a Barbie.	3	6
I think he wants you to know that he wants to be your friend.	3	6
And you are very important to me, too.	3	6
I'm sure you all have a thousand questions,	3	6
but before I raise a glass to Sterling Cooper's future,	3	6
I should like to recognize its past.	3	6
Most recently, the inspired stewardship of Lane Pryce.	3	6
Hear! Hear!	3	6
I'm also aware of a rather significant milestone.	3	6
Mrs. Harris, from those who've known you only hours	3	6
to those who have cherished your nearly 10 years of service,	3	6
I wish you caviar and children and all that is good in your new life.	3	6
There, there. That wasn't my intention.	3	6
Mrs. Harris, please.	3	6
We'll have our presentations tomorrow. Let this afternoon be a fete worthy of Joan.	3	6
Enjoy the liquor and delicatessen.	3	6
Thank you. Thank you all.	3	6
- This is completely unnecessary. - You'll be sorely missed.	3	6
We got you the cake.	3	6
Well...	3	6
So, what now? They keep adding people above us.	3	6
One more promotion and we're gonna be answering phones.	3	6
We should go say hi.	3	6
- This is good champagne. - I don't think so.	3	6
I'm going to get something to eat.	3	6
Mr. Draper, Conrad Hilton's office is on the line.	3	6
- What? - Conrad Hilton, the hotel owner.	3	6
Yeah, I know what he does. Why is he calling?	3	6
I don't know.	3	6
- And he's calling for me? - Yes. Well, his office is.	3	6
Put him through.	3	6
- Donald Draper. - Mr. Draper, this is Miss Wakeman.	3	6
Mr. Hilton has expressed a desire to meet with you.	3	6
May I ask what this is regarding?	3	6
I just set his schedule. When are you available?	3	6
- How about right now? - Right now? Please hold.	3	6
- How far are you from the Waldorf Astoria? - Fifteen minutes.	3	6
It's the presidential suite.	3	6
I'm on my way.	3	6
- Where's Miss Blankenship? - She's down there saluting Union Jack.	3	6
- What is that? - Chocolate pudding.	3	6
I wasn't even on the chart. My name's on the wall out there.	3	6
- You want some? - No.	3	6
"I like to think, ""I'm rich. They can't hurt me."""	3	6
That's a mistake.	3	6
I'm being punished for making my job look easy.	3	6
Although that kid, Guy, he has a spark. He is a pure account man.	3	6
And what is that job all about?	3	6
I don't know. It's about listening to people	3	6
and never saying what's really on your mind.	3	6
No. It's about letting things go so you can get what you want.	3	6
Have a nice holiday. Enjoy the fireworks.	3	6
We took their money. We have to do what they say.	3	6
My dad keeps talking about Vietnam. I think he wants me to get drafted.	3	6
First of all, they're hardly drafting anybody. Second of all, you're too old.	3	6
Third of all, I have a friend in the army, and if you're smart, you're set.	3	6
He sits behind a desk at Fort Dix and screws secretaries all day.	3	6
- Does he shoot the peoples? - I don't know. I gotta take a piss.	3	6
- Joan. - Yes?	3	6
- May I speak with you? - Thank you.	3	6
I just... I wanted to get you a card or a present.	3	6
It'd be nice if I gave you a gift for once	3	6
and you didn't wonder if I wanted something.	3	6
Knock yourself out.	3	6
I don't want you to think I never listen to you.	3	6
It's just we can't all be you.	3	6
Be that as it may, I do take some credit for your success here.	3	6
- Hey, put that back. - I'm going home!	3	6
I can't believe I'm gonna miss this!	3	6
I'm really happy that you got what you wanted.	3	6
I remember on my first day you said that could happen to me	3	6
- if I played my cards right. - Are you getting sentimental?	3	6
Oh, my God.	3	6
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll see each other all the time.	3	6
If we don't, I just have to say...	3	6
- For the love of Christ! - Oh, my God.	3	6
My foot!	3	6
- Call an ambulance! - Holy crap!	3	6
Jesus!	3	6
There's a tourniquet in the first aid kit. You're gonna be okay.	3	6
Good God.	3	6
I can't feel a thing.	3	6
- God! What did I do? - Get her out of here!	3	6
The ambulance is on its way.	3	6
- I'm Donald Draper. - We've met before.	3	6
- We have, haven't we? - Yellow Rock Country Club.	3	6
- We had a drink. Of course. - You fixed it for me. Let me return the favor.	3	6
I can't believe you're Conrad Hilton.	3	6
- Connie. - Don.	3	6
Food? Best kitchen in the world. Got a salad named after it.	3	6
I'm fine. I really should have known that.	3	6
I don't know. Now...	3	6
After this comes out next week...	3	6
Well, they don't do that for everyone.	3	6
I think I look like an Arab.	3	6
How did you find me?	3	6
I called around, told people I had a long chat	3	6
with a handsome fellow from Sterling Cooper,	3	6
and your name never came up.	3	6
Apparently you don't have long chats with people.	3	6
Well, here I am. What can I do for you?	3	6
What do you think?	3	6
I think you wouldn't be in the presidential suite right now	3	6
- if you worked for free. - Don, this is friendly.	3	6
Connie, this is my profession. What do you want me to do?	3	6
I want you to give me one for free.	3	6
I don't think anybody wants to think about a mouse in a hotel.	3	6
Well, that was my idea. You got something better?	3	6
I might.	3	6
So, what do you want?	3	6
I'm not gonna lie. I'd love a chance at your business.	3	6
Okay.	3	6
But the next time somebody like me asks you a question like that,	3	6
you need to think bigger.	3	6
Well, Connie,	3	6
there are snakes that go months without eating,	3	6
and then they finally catch something,	3	6
but they're so hungry that they suffocate while they're eating.	3	6
One opportunity at a time.	3	6
Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Draper, you have an emergency call.	3	6
Home or office?	3	6
Do you understand what's happened here? That we're not to be trusted?	3	6
She's an idiot. I didn't know she couldn't drive.	3	6
But you took the machine out.	3	6
You have to have respect for that equipment.	3	6
- It's very safe when operated correctly. - We had the world handed to us on a plate,	3	6
and then you swing in on a chandelier, drop your pants and crap on it.	3	6
Jesus, it's like Iwo Jima out there.	3	6
We should put a rubber mat down so Cooper can get around.	3	6
They're changing the carpeting.	3	6
- Any news? - He might lose his foot.	3	6
Right when he got it in the door.	3	6
- Oh, God. - Sit down, Sissy Mary. You're pale.	3	6
I take full responsibility.	3	6
Believe me, somewhere in this business, this has happened before.	3	6
Joan. My God.	3	6
- I know. It's ruined. - How is he?	3	6
I didn't expect you to come over. I just thought you should know.	3	6
Honestly, when I called you, I thought he might die.	3	6
- But he's not going to? - No. He's lost the foot.	3	6
Jesus, that's awful.	3	6
Lane went to retrieve Powell and Ford from dinner.	3	6
They've already talked to the doctor.	3	6
I'll wait.	3	6
Despite the circus today,	3	6
I hope you know that you are going to be terribly missed.	3	6
That's nice to hear, especially from you, Don.	3	6
I bet he felt great when he woke up this morning.	3	6
I'm sure you're right.	3	6
But that's life. One minute, you're on top of the world,	3	6
the next minute, some secretary is running you over with a lawn mower.	3	6
Don.	3	6
I'm heartbroken.	3	6
- It's a terrible tragedy. - One that surely could have been avoided,	3	6
although, Mrs. Harris, thank you for your quick thinking.	3	6
- You may have saved his life. - Such as it is.	3	6
He was a great account man. A prodigy. He could talk a Scotsman out of a penny.	3	6
- Now that's all over. - I don't know if that's true.	3	6
The man is missing a foot. How is he going to work? He can't walk.	3	6
The doctor said he'll never golf again.	3	6
I'm afraid we have to reevaluate our entire strategy.	3	6
- Lane will remain here indefinitely. - We'll close the office tomorrow, obviously.	3	6
Mrs. Harris, please allow the company to reimburse you for that dress,	3	6
just as a token of our gratitude.	3	6
I think Saint John and I should see him if we can.	3	6
Of course.	3	6
You should get home to that lucky husband.	3	6
Yes.	3	6
- Can I get you one? - Sure.	3	6
I've been reading a lot of American literature lately.	3	6
- Tom Sawyer. - That's a good one.	3	6
I feel like I just went to my own funeral. I didn't like the eulogy.	3	6
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.	3	6
- Daddy! - Hey. Hey, I got you. I got you. Just breathe.	3	6
Get him out, Daddy! Please, Daddy, save me.	3	6
I don't even know what to say.	3	6
Daddy.	3	6
Calm down and tell me what's going on.	3	6
Grandpa Gene. He's not supposed to be here anymore.	3	6
He's not.	3	6
He's called Gene, he sleeps in his room, he looks just like him,	3	6
and I bet when he starts talking, he's gonna sound just like him, too.	3	6
He's a baby. That's it.	3	6
I want you to go to sleep. There's no such thing as ghosts.	3	6
Betts, this has to stop.	3	6
There's nothing I can do. She's jealous of her little brother.	3	6
No, she's not jealous, she's scared, and it's all because he has that name.	3	6
"""That name."""	3	6
You've never liked it and you haven't hidden it well,	3	6
- and now you're bringing her into this. - That's ridiculous. Let's talk about Sally.	3	6
She's a child. She'll get over it. Now you have to.	3	6
He was my father and that was his name.	3	6
It's what people do, Don. It's how they keep the memory alive.	3	6
He hated me and I hated him. That's the memory.	3	6
That's his name!	3	6
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to wake him.	3	6
That's okay, honey. Everything's fine.	3	6
Come on. Let's get you to sleep.	3	6
Come over here.	3	6
You see? It's all right.	3	6
This is your little brother,	3	6
and he's only a baby.	3	6
We don't know who he is yet,	3	6
or who he's going to be.	3	6
And that is a wonderful thing.	3	6
Don?	3	7
What do you think?	3	7
Now, it may take a moment to get used to. I told you, men don't like change.	3	7
Well, it's hard for me to judge when I can't see a price tag.	3	7
A modern Chinoiserie breakfront,	3	7
a Dunbar,  Japanese-influenced sofa,	3	7
silk Dupioni drapes, Murano vases,	3	7
and a classic Drexel end table.	3	7
- And what goes here? - Where?	3	7
Right where we're standing.	3	7
Well, that's your hearth, darling. That's the soul of your home.	3	7
 People gather around a fire even if there isn't one.	3	7
- So, Don? - I think it's fine, Betts.	3	7
All you do at work all day is evaluate objects.	3	7
I would like the benefit of your eye.	3	7
Move the end table and the lamp to the other end of the couch.	3	7
I think he's right.	3	7
- Hot as hell already. - Yes, it is.	3	7
I watched the sunrise today. Couldn't sleep.	3	7
- How was it? - Average.	3	7
Ogilvy wrote a book. I got the galleys.	3	7
They want a quote or something.	3	7
Advertising's already up there with lawyers as the most reviled.	3	7
This is not going to help.	3	7
It'll help him.	3	7
 It's called Confessions of an Ad Man.	3	7
- I like the title. - Please.	3	7
It's a book everybody writes, only he got it published.	3	7
It should be called 1,000 Reasons I'm So Great.	3	7
- Is he publishing it himself? - No, Atheneum.	3	7
I'll send it over. I don't want you to buy it.	3	7
I don't know where to put it, and you know I wouldn't be able to tell you if...	3	7
There you are.	3	7
When do you want us to move the meeting to?	3	7
- Mr. Draper? - Move it? I'm 15 minutes late.	3	7
I told you I don't want them hovering.	3	7
If I'm late, send them away and call them when I get here.	3	7
Mr. Draper, Conrad Hilton is in your office.	3	7
- Right now? - He just walked right in.	3	7
- We were waiting and he blew right past us. - Hold on.	3	7
Come back in 20 minutes.	3	7
- Did you offer him coffee? - I did. He's all set.	3	7
You look great.	3	7
- Twenty minutes. - You can take an hour if you need it.	3	7
- He wants to look busy. - Move it.	3	7
Allison, hold all my calls.	3	7
Connie. What a great way to start the day.	3	7
- 9:30? It's practically lunch. - Well, can I get you something?	3	7
I've got a personal matter. It's not fit for the phone.	3	7
What can I do for you?	3	7
I don't know what I'm more disturbed by, the fact that you don't have a Bible,	3	7
or that there's not a single family photo.	3	7
- I'm easily distracted. - You should have those things.	3	7
They'll make you feel better about what you do.	3	7
Start showing up on time.	3	7
Maybe I'm late because I was spending time with my family reading the Bible.	3	7
Are you nervous, Don? I'm finding you hard to talk to.	3	7
Well, you caught me by surprise, Connie. I think you know that.	3	7
Now, you're a married man, so you'll have to use your imagination,	3	7
but	3	7
I have this involvement.	3	7
I can't say it's perfect, and my needs are being met,	3	7
but I have significant needs, Don.	3	7
- Do you catch my drift? - Yes.	3	7
So what do I do when my eye starts to wander?	3	7
Don't you have a coterie of trusted advisors, friends, kings,	3	7
that might counsel you better?	3	7
I want you to handle the Waldorf-Astoria, the New York Hilton and the Statler Hilton.	3	7
It's just New York, but my eye has definitely started to wander.	3	7
I think that's a good start.	3	7
Retainer, etcetera, that's for lawyers. Everything else will be like this.	3	7
Having me in your life is gonna change things.	3	7
- I look forward to it. - They always say that.	3	7
- A happy bunch. - If you say so.	3	7
Young people give us energy. Don't forget that.	3	7
I'll take it from here.	3	7
It's not much to start with,	3	7
but I look forward to sharing my dreams with you.	3	7
Speak to you soon.	3	7
I cannot believe you just had a baby and you redid your house.	3	7
Are you suicidal?	3	7
They were not supposed to be simultaneous,	3	7
and the baby wasn't the one that couldn't keep a schedule.	3	7
I'm assuming this meeting means you're interested	3	7
in replacing Francine as secretary?	3	7
- I am. - Good.	3	7
Because we waited for you for our most pressing business.	3	7
The proposed 3-million-gallon water tank	3	7
will not only drain the Pleasantville Road Reservoir,	3	7
but also blemish the natural and financial health of our community.	3	7
Well said.	3	7
The Junior League needs to take over this effort and explain the issues.	3	7
Now, first, conservation. The Silent Spring?	3	7
The majestic beauty of the Hudson River valley.	3	7
Second, worthless real estate on both sides of the river	3	7
because some industrial park on Route 9 needs our water.	3	7
We need to go over the Village Board's head,	3	7
appeal to the governor. The Rockefellers own half the land here.	3	7
Real estate, that's scary.	3	7
I may know someone in the governor's office.	3	7
Who?	3	7
His name is Henry.	3	7
You're gonna have to do better than that.	3	7
Henry Francis.	3	7
He's in the paper sometimes, always right behind Rocky.	3	7
- What does he do? - I'm not really sure.	3	7
- How do you know him? - I met him at a party for Don's work.	3	7
"Here he is. Oh, my, it just says ""Advisor. """	3	7
Yes, I know who he is.	3	7
He used to be the Republican Party chair for Westchester County.	3	7
- I know him. - Well, call him, then.	3	7
I think we have a better chance if Betty calls.	3	7
It's not adorable to pretend like you're not adorable.	3	7
Call him. He's a big deal.	3	7
Miami is where we should start, let it grow from there.	3	7
Ho-Ho wants it everywhere.	3	7
He just bought land in Seattle. It's an indoor city.	3	7
As long as he keeps writing checks.	3	7
Look, do you want to kill this thing in one blow	3	7
or do you want to shear the sheep every year?	3	7
Whatever you want, Don.	3	7
You made it clear you don't want to talk about it,	3	7
but at least tell us how you know him.	3	7
We ran into each other at a party.	3	7
That'll be all.	3	7
I know Roger will be the face of this thing, but I wouldn't mind doing the legwork.	3	7
Pete, I think you're supposed to bring in the account,	3	7
and I'm supposed to beg to be on it.	3	7
What happened with North American Aviation?	3	7
It's going well.	3	7
My friend Russ, who deals with McNamara's office	3	7
said the orders are through the roof	3	7
for helicopters, carbines and especially jets for Vietnam.	3	7
I think I've convinced North American they're going to need to spend more	3	7
if they want to get out of NASA and into the Pentagon.	3	7
When they do, we can talk about Hilton.	3	7
Understood.	3	7
Oh, no. Yes, of course.	3	7
He's busy.	3	7
It's Wilson 4-8038.	3	7
Betty Draper. He can call me anytime.	3	7
It's a civic matter regarding Ossining. Thank you.	3	7
Lunch!	3	7
Wash your hands, Bobby.	3	7
Draper residence.	3	7
Mrs. Draper, it's Henry Francis.	3	7
Yes, of course.	3	7
I appreciate you getting back to me so quickly.	3	7
Stop it.	3	7
Could you hold just a moment? I'm going to get on the extension.	3	7
Of course.	3	7
I'm going in the study. Hang up the phone.	3	7
Damn it!	3	7
- What is wrong with you? - You said to hang up the phone.	3	7
After I pick up the phone.	3	7
Freeze.	3	7
Draper residence.	3	7
It's Henry again. We were disconnected.	3	7
I'm sorry about that. My son.	3	7
I know how that goes. How are you? You must have had your baby by now.	3	7
Yes, I did. You remembered.	3	7
- What did you have? - A little boy.	3	7
Can you get him registered by November?	3	7
I just realized, everyone who calls you must want something.	3	7
Actually, I've been doing most of the calling lately.	3	7
- What can I do for you? - Well, we were hoping	3	7
you could stop the destruction of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.	3	7
- Who's we? - I'm representing the Junior League	3	7
of Tarrytown.	3	7
They want to build a 3-million-gallon water tank, and it's a very scenic area.	3	7
I know the area.	3	7
Well, it's practically the governor's backyard.	3	7
That's true, but I grew up there as well.	3	7
- Really? Where? - Mount Salem.	3	7
I'm heading upstate tomorrow afternoon. Maybe I could stop by and take a look.	3	7
Well, tomorrow is Saturday.	3	7
No, of course. I work every day, I forget other people don't.	3	7
No.	3	7
This is very important to me. I think I could find the time.	3	7
- Is Swenson's Bakery still there? - It is. And it has an air conditioner.	3	7
I'll buy you a cup of coffee, and then we can take a hike to the reservoir.	3	7
- Is 3:00 too late for you? - No, it's perfect. I'll make it work.	3	7
Well, I'll see you then, Mrs. Draper.	3	7
I can save you the trouble. It's from him and it's expensive.	3	7
I'm going to fire her.	3	7
- What did you promise him? - Who?	3	7
You're thick, do you know that? That present, it's from Duck.	3	7
- Herm?s. Nice. - I hope yours is a different color.	3	7
"""Elegance and success. Duck. "" I wonder who wrote that for him."	3	7
- I don't trust him. - Why?	3	7
Because he wants us?	3	7
- We're very important here. - Who is?	3	7
- Did he put you on Hilton? - I don't know what you're talking about.	3	7
Stop barging in here and infecting me with your anxiety.	3	7
This is really beautiful.	3	7
He sent me a box of Cuban cigars.	3	7
Although I'm starting to think they're not that hard to come by.	3	7
- Hilton Hotels? Did we get that? - Do you live in a cave?	3	7
Conrad Hilton came to see Don this morning.	3	7
- He was right there. - Really? What was he like?	3	7
I only got a quick look at him. He was skinny, like a cowboy.	3	7
My mother gave me his book. He's Catholic.	3	7
- It's going to be a huge account. - Not as big as Lucky Strike.	3	7
But it would be nice to be playing a little offense for once	3	7
instead of hiding from the FTC.	3	7
- He has a book? - I really like this.	3	7
Look, I'm keeping this. Duck said we're not tied together.	3	7
I'll keep my mouth shut and you do whatever you want.	3	7
Do you know why Duck doesn't work here anymore?	3	7
Because Don squeezed him out when the British took over.	3	7
So what? Don didn't like him.	3	7
It's the world against Don, and now it's someone else.	3	7
True, but Duck would love to hit Don where it hurts.	3	7
Well, I'm not going anywhere, and I'm not going to tell Don.	3	7
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about Duck.	3	7
Send it back.	3	7
When were you going to tell us about this?	3	7
I thought I'd let it be an incoming phone call,	3	7
and then wait and see who took credit for it.	3	7
This is very exciting.	3	7
Despite its modest billings,	3	7
London is thrilled with Hilton's potential for international growth.	3	7
Finally.	3	7
Huzzah!	3	7
If you don't mind my asking, how did you make this happen?	3	7
We travel in the same circles.	3	7
Well, I don't know if we should celebrate yet.	3	7
His lawyers called, and there's a little matter of the contract.	3	7
Well, don't be afraid to push back. I agreed to the New York hotels,	3	7
but everything else should be under our terms.	3	7
I don't think you understand. This is regarding your contract.	3	7
Or lack thereof.	3	7
It may seem like a formality to you,	3	7
but to Mr. Hilton it's a necessity that all the principals in the firm be secured.	3	7
And honestly, I can't blame him.	3	7
- I'll give him my word. - And he'll take it, but his lawyers won't.	3	7
Obviously, you'll want your attorney to look it over.	3	7
That's Ben Michelson. It's fairly standard.	3	7
Three years, a non-compete clause, a healthy raise.	3	7
That's very generous. I'll think about it.	3	7
I'm confused.	3	7
If someone handed me that contract, I'd be filled with glee.	3	7
A three-year guarantee, a $5,000 signing bonus? I...	3	7
- I've never seen that before. - Well, we want to take care of him.	3	7
Look, I've gotten to know Conrad Hilton a little bit.	3	7
And I think he'll enjoy something he can't have,	3	7
and you should tell him that it matters to me.	3	7
It matters to him.	3	7
Still, I don't think anyone told him that it matters to me.	3	7
Well, this is the way it has to be.	3	7
And not just for Conrad Hilton, but for Sterling Cooper.	3	7
I'd like you to take those papers home for the weekend and think about that.	3	7
I'd be happy to.	3	7
I met him once. He's a bit of an eccentric, isn't he?	3	7
Yes.	3	7
Oh, Jesus.	3	7
- Mrs. Draper. - Mr. Francis.	3	7
I'm alone. I hope that's okay.	3	7
Oh, well. Actually, my friend couldn't get away either.	3	7
- I appreciate your coming up. - Please. I love coming back here.	3	7
- So much changes, so much doesn't. - Like what? I'm interested.	3	7
Can I help you?	3	7
- Just an iced tea, please. - That's fine for now.	3	7
- What was I saying? - You were talking about coming back here.	3	7
Ossining has always been a real mix of people.	3	7
Well, after living in Manhattan, it wasn't my first choice,	3	7
but it's grown on me.	3	7
I lived in Manhattan when I was married.	3	7
It's okay for work, but I can't sleep with all those people on top of me.	3	7
Like in a skyscraper. May I have a straw?	3	7
So, you have your folder.	3	7
I thought I'd just give you the literature and a copy of the petition.	3	7
I don't know that I'm a great spokesman.	3	7
You don't have to tell me how beautiful the reservoir is.	3	7
- I used to do jackknives into it. - We drink that water.	3	7
I've looked into this for you, and I'm afraid it's underway.	3	7
Oh, no. We're too late.	3	7
Maybe if you knew somebody with some clout.	3	7
I don't even know what you do.	3	7
I'm a classic strategist, fundraiser, maybe campaign manager.	3	7
- I'm waiting on that. - And how do you become that?	3	7
- Give a lot of money? - No.	3	7
No, I'm a lawyer, but I don't use it much.	3	7
We all have skills we don't use. I was an anthropology major. Imagine that.	3	7
- Where? - Bryn Mawr.	3	7
Well, you may be saving your community right now.	3	7
I'm hungry. Do you mind?	3	7
- I don't know. - Fine.	3	7
You can read from your folder and watch me eat.	3	7
I'll have apple pie and...	3	7
Ice cream or cheddar cheese?	3	7
One of each.	3	7
Can we just get one thing out of the way?	3	7
I don't know what I can do about the water tank.	3	7
Don't give up so easily.	3	7
What this really is, is a camera obscura.	3	7
We call it a sun scope.	3	7
And it allows us to look at the eclipse without injury to our eyes.	3	7
- We didn't bring a scissor. - I have scissors.	3	7
And squares of cardboard that already have pinholes in them.	3	7
And if you really need some help, ask your dads.	3	7
The eclipse is 22 minutes away. Gentlemen, start your engines.	3	7
I could have gone golfing. I had no idea this is what we'd be in for.	3	7
Go ahead. I'll take Ernie home.	3	7
You know, Francine taught school when we were first married.	3	7
I used to love seeing her standing in the middle of those little kids	3	7
like a telephone pole. Hey.	3	7
There you go.	3	7
Sally has a crush on her.	3	7
Why can't you stare into the eclipse?	3	7
What's it going to do, really? I stare at the sun every day.	3	7
- You stare at the sun every day? - Well, you know, look at it.	3	7
You know, I see her sometimes when I'm out running in the morning.	3	7
- You run? - Yeah, over by the high school track.	3	7
- Do you talk? - No. No, there's an etiquette to it.	3	7
You keep to yourself.	3	7
And honestly, that's one of the things I love about my run, is being alone.	3	7
That's hard to come by, you know?	3	7
Listen, I hate to disappoint you, but I have to be on my way.	3	7
- That's too bad. - I have to be in Albany for dinner.	3	7
His master's voice.	3	7
The governor.	3	7
"""His master's voice""? It's an old ad."	3	7
I know what it is.	3	7
- What are you doing? - It's the eclipse.	3	7
He made a contraption.	3	7
Don't look at it.	3	7
Are you okay?	3	7
I think so. I feel a little dizzy.	3	7
Take a deep breath.	3	7
Is that better?	3	7
So you never had time to go to the reservoir anyway.	3	7
I only had an hour, but I figured...	3	7
That's what you need. A fainting couch.	3	7
What's that?	3	7
Victorian ladies would get overwhelmed from corsets and things.	3	7
They'd need a place to lie down.	3	7
- How do you know that? - I used to move furniture.	3	7
May I walk you to your car?	3	7
- I don't know. This is still a small town. - No, of course.	3	7
- Mrs. Draper. - Betty.	3	7
Henry.	3	7
So, that's a rain check for the hike. I'll contact you as soon as I know anything.	3	7
You doing okay?	3	7
- You don't want to watch it? - I will once it gets a little further along.	3	7
I don't know if you heard me before, but it only happens once every 10 years.	3	7
You don't want to miss it.	3	7
- How's your summer going? - It's good.	3	7
- Are you gonna take a vacation? - I don't think so. I'll get August off,	3	7
then September I'm back at it. It's all fairly prescribed.	3	7
Have you been here in August? It's a ghost town.	3	7
- Where are you going? - We'll be here.	3	7
So now I know that.	3	7
Most just come right out and ask if I'm going to be around.	3	7
I was just making conversation. You can change it if you want to.	3	7
You're all the same. The drinking, the philandering.	3	7
They don't know that word.	3	7
Do you want me to leave you alone? Just say so.	3	7
- It's hard because this happens a lot. - Nothing is happening. We're just talking.	3	7
Okay.	3	7
And where I come from, schoolteachers, especially, used to say	3	7
you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.	3	7
- So you're different, huh? - Is that impossible?	3	7
You're all wearing the same shirt.	3	7
So how do people live elsewhere?	3	7
They don't have as much. They don't get as bored.	3	7
I'm not bored.	3	7
Miss Farrell. Miss Farrell. I can see it. Look!	3	7
Let me see it with you. Show me.	3	7
Yes, is he in?	3	7
Tell him it's Peggy Olson regarding Clorox.	3	7
Of course.	3	7
Hello.	3	7
Miss Olson, what a pleasant surprise.	3	7
I haven't changed my mind, and I'd appreciate you not sending things.	3	7
- Things you want to keep? - I'm sending it back.	3	7
And I hope you take that as a definitive answer.	3	7
I would if you already sent it.	3	7
Listen. I've been having meetings at The Pierre all day, suite 600.	3	7
At 4:30, Herm?s comes by. Give it back in person.	3	7
- Why are you meeting at The Pierre? - Have you been to Grey?	3	7
It's a Penn Station toilet with Venetian blinds.	3	7
I can't do that.	3	7
You can and you will, then I'll leave you alone.	3	7
Suite 600 at 4:30, not the other way around.	3	7
Please don't contact me again.	3	7
- How was your weekend? - Short.	3	7
- What did Michelson think of the contract? - He hasn't gotten back to me.	3	7
That's because he didn't get it. I called him.	3	7
Are you afraid you're going to have a boss? You will, the client.	3	7
- It's not that. - What is the problem?	3	7
You think you're more dangerous without a contract?	3	7
You are, and it's affecting our business.	3	7
You're our David Ogilvy,	3	7
and if you let all the blokes at Putnam, Powell & Lowe relax for three years,	3	7
maybe we could put your name out front. After mine. And Cooper, probably.	3	7
Well, I'll let you get back to work. All I need is a letter of intent.	3	7
"Ben Michelson can rape us later. Grunt once for ""yes. """	3	7
The problem is, I don't know if you don't want to do this here	3	7
or you don't want to do this at all.	3	7
Didn't we give you an office?	3	7
I just need a minute. I need to send Martinson's to the printer.	3	7
Come on in.	3	7
So, do you know who you're gonna put on Hilton yet?	3	7
No.	3	7
Well, I don't know if they want a woman's point of view,	3	7
- but I read his book, and... - Who told you	3	7
we were going to land Hilton? Because we're not.	3	7
And I resent you bringing work in here under pretense.	3	7
- I didn't. - I didn't need to sign off on this.	3	7
I'm sorry if... I was excited.	3	7
And I heard there was an amazing assignment.	3	7
And you thought you'd come in here and ask for it because I never say no.	3	7
You say no all the time.	3	7
What do I have to do for you? Peggy, tell me.	3	7
You were my secretary,	3	7
and now you have an office and a job that a lot of full-grown men would kill for.	3	7
Every time I turn around, you've got your hand in my pocket.	3	7
You want a raise. You want this account.	3	7
Put your nose down and pay attention to your work,	3	7
because there's not one thing that you've done here	3	7
that I couldn't live without.	3	7
I'm sorry, Don.	3	7
You're good. Get better. Stop asking for things.	3	7
Close the door.	3	7
Draper residence.	3	7
Betty. Roger Sterling. How are you?	3	7
- I'm well, thank you. - Is Don about?	3	7
No, he's not home yet. Shall I leave word?	3	7
Actually, Betty, if I could be frank, it's important.	3	7
- What's wrong? - Well, it's a little touchy.	3	7
I don't want to put you in a strange position.	3	7
- What's wrong, Roger? - Well, it's about his contract.	3	7
What about it?	3	7
Look, I know you have to be on the same page as him,	3	7
and he's your husband. But it's a lot of money, Betty.	3	7
- Three years isn't that long, you know. - I'm sorry. What do you want?	3	7
I want you to see what you can do to get him to sign it.	3	7
I know you're the woman behind the man.	3	7
Don is going to do whatever he's going to do.	3	7
And honestly, I find it terribly disrespectful that you would go behind his back.	3	7
- Easy, Betty, that's not... - I have to go.	3	7
You missed Herm?s. I was going to give you 10 more minutes.	3	7
You came all this way, have a drink.	3	7
- What are you having? - Whatever you're having.	3	7
- I'm not having anything. - A whiskey.	3	7
- You are Don's girl, aren't you? - I was raised on whiskey.	3	7
Sit down.	3	7
A few minutes of adult conversation, and we both go home.	3	7
Grey has Herm?s, Macy's,	3	7
H.J. Heinz baby food and Revlon.	3	7
- You need someone in a skirt. - Everybody does.	3	7
Copy chief?	3	7
Maybe once they get used to you, but definitely more money.	3	7
- Would I get to go to Paris for Herm?s? - They come here,	3	7
but you're not going anywhere where you are.	3	7
- I can't. - Okay.	3	7
Just so you know, that's what opportunity looks like.	3	7
I'm just sorry I won't be seeing you every day.	3	7
What are you doing?	3	7
I was just thinking about all the times I've walked by you and didn't even notice.	3	7
How is that possible?	3	7
What do you want from me?	3	7
I want to take you in that bedroom, lock the door,	3	7
take your clothes off with my teeth, throw you on the bed	3	7
and give you a go-around like you've never had.	3	7
Bobby, Sally, turn off the TV and go upstairs.	3	7
- What's wrong? - Roger Sterling called.	3	7
He pretended to be calling for you, and then he started on me about your contract.	3	7
- What? - Your contract, Don.	3	7
It was very uncomfortable.	3	7
- What are you doing? - What do you think?	3	7
- I'm calling him. - Don't.	3	7
Betts, don't worry about my job.	3	7
Why would I? I don't know anything about it.	3	7
They offered you a contract and you didn't say a damn thing to me.	3	7
I had to hear about it from him. And why the hell won't you sign it?	3	7
It doesn't concern you. You're taken care of.	3	7
Why won't you sign it?	3	7
Let me explain something to you about business,	3	7
since, as usual, you're turning this into something about yourself.	3	7
No contract means I have all the power. They want me, but they can't have me.	3	7
You're right.	3	7
Why would I think that has anything to do with me?	3	7
It's three years, Don.	3	7
What's the matter? You don't know where you're going to be in three years?	3	7
Good night.	3	7
I love the taste of liquor on your breath.	3	7
- Where you headed? - Niagara Falls.	3	7
But we'll settle for the nearest motel.	3	7
Hop in.	3	7
Thank you.	3	7
- I'm Doug. This is Sandy. - Nice to meet you.	3	7
- How far are we? - A couple of miles.	3	7
You wanna know why we're going to Niagara Falls?	3	7
- We're getting married. - At Niagara Falls. Fancy that.	3	7
- People keep trying to talk us out of it. - Why's that?	3	7
Well, we don't really know each other that well.	3	7
Well, we knew each other a little bit in high school,	3	7
and we're not really in love or anything.	3	7
I'm sure you have a good reason, not that it's any of my business.	3	7
I'm not knocked up.	3	7
They're passing a law that if you're married, they can't send you to Vietnam.	3	7
I don't know if you've served, mister. I don't want to offend you.	3	7
Again, none of my business.	3	7
It's just I'm 1-A. I'm 22. I can't get into school.	3	7
I kind of have a target on my back, and for what?	3	7
I think they're really gonna start sending people.	3	7
I have it on good authority that you're right.	3	7
Good authority? Are you a spook?	3	7
Nope. I'm in advertising.	3	7
No way. Now that's priceless.	3	7
- But you seem okay. - Thank you.	3	7
It's a beautiful night. It smells good.	3	7
But everything smells good when you're high.	3	7
That's true.	3	7
Listen, Cadillac,	3	7
we don't have gas money, but...	3	7
Yeah.	3	7
- They're reds. You ever had them? - What are they?	3	7
Phenobarbital. They're my dad's.	3	7
Give me one. Make it two.	3	7
- Does he know how to dance? - Who cares?	3	7
- How old are you? - Nineteen.	3	7
How old are you?	3	7
- Why can't you go to school? - Because it's a waste of time, man.	3	7
- You like to watch us dance? - Yeah, you want to watch us?	3	7
A hillbilly knocks on the door of his new neighbor's house.	3	7
"""Howdy, neighbor,"" he says."	3	7
"""In honor of you moving into the holler, I'm gonna throw a party."	3	7
"""There's gonna be a whole lot of drinking,"	3	7
"""a whole lot of dancing and a whole lot of screwing. """	3	7
"""Sounds like fun,"" the neighbor says. ""What can I bring?"""	3	7
"The hillbilly replies, ""You can bring anything you want."	3	7
"""It's just gonna be you and me. """	3	7
What are you laughing at, Cadillac?	3	7
Look at you. Up to your old tricks.	3	7
You're a bum, you know that?	3	7
- No, I'm not. - Conrad Hilton?	3	7
You wouldn't expect him to be taken so easily.	3	7
- Shut up. - You can't be tied down.	3	7
- That's right. - Look at your hands.	3	7
They're as soft as a woman's.	3	7
What do you do? What do you make?	3	7
You grow bullshit.	3	7
- I gave him two. - How the hell is he still awake?	3	7
Everything okay?	3	7
I'm worried that housekeeping is going to come in.	3	7
I put out the sign. I'll call them when we're done.	3	7
- I don't know. - Come on. I love the morning.	3	7
What were you thinking? It's awful.	3	7
- It's an antique. - We discussed this for months,	3	7
and we decided antiques were expected.	3	7
Look around! You have ruined the whole room.	3	7
If you want to keep it, please do not tell people I did this.	3	7
- Good morning. - Fender bender.	3	7
I'm going to get coffee. Do you want some?	3	7
No, thank you.	3	7
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	3	7
- Fender bender. - I'm sorry. Mr. Cooper's waiting for you.	3	7
Thank you.	3	7
- Good morning. - Sit down.	3	7
What do you want?	3	7
Sacajawea carried a baby on her back all the way to the Pacific Ocean.	3	7
And somewhere, that baby thinks he discovered America.	3	7
You, Don, have been standing on someone's shoulders.	3	7
We brought you in, we nurtured you like family,	3	7
and now's the time to pay us back.	3	7
You can't go any further on your own, Don.	3	7
Would you say I know something about you, Don?	3	7
I would.	3	7
Then sign.	3	7
After all, when it comes down to it, who is really signing this contract anyway?	3	7
I don't want any more contact with Roger Sterling.	3	7
Don?	3	7
I signed it.	3	7
I've prepared all  of your correspondence,	3	8
and the summaries are here for you to go over.	3	8
You can put them down.	3	8
Well, it's just... It's 5:00.	3	8
Sorry about that. You probably want to be leaving.	3	8
What are you up to?	3	8
Well, some of the girls from here	3	8
and the traveler's insurance got a place in Saltaire.	3	8
- Mosquitoes. - They don't bother me.	3	8
Some people they bother, some people they don't.	3	8
- I'm just one of those people. - A thing like that.	3	8
 Is he making you work because he's got no place to go?	3	8
- No. - Have a wonderful weekend, dear.	3	8
Why is it that a man on his own is an object of pity	3	8
when she's really the one you should feel sorry for?	3	8
I don't feel sorry for her. Those girls do whatever they want.	3	8
Still working, Campbell? There's no reason to show off.	3	8
Cooper's in Montana, Sterling's in Jane	3	8
- and Draper's on vacation. - He's not on vacation.	3	8
He's been in Dallas or Denver or something. Hilton sent him to every armpit he has.	3	8
I'd like to get out of town in August once, even for work.	3	8
I love this time of year.	3	8
It's quiet. It used to be like this when I was a kid all the time.	3	8
I'd lie in bed at night, hear horses going by.	3	8
New York in August? It's like a great, big, melting wax museum.	3	8
 Nothing but those fat girls with the hairy armpits	3	8
putting their feet in the fountain.	3	8
You know what? My weekend doesn't look so bad now.	3	8
I'll take anybody for a drink who wants one.	3	8
I poured you a beer.	3	8
If you were wondering, there's a Hathaway in there.	3	8
- The hotel gave me someone else's shirt. - Then you should complain to Mr. Hilton.	3	8
- They should be paying you for this. - There's a hearing,	3	8
and I'm paid well enough already.	3	8
- What are they doing out there? - Catching lightning bugs.	3	8
You should join them.	3	8
Yes, this is Elizabeth Draper from the Junior League of Tarrytown	3	8
calling for Mrs. Howard Englewood.	3	8
We're trying to save the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.	3	8
When do you expect them back?	3	8
Well, that's no good.	3	8
Yes, have a good evening.	3	8
Draper residence.	3	8
Just a minute. Don. Come on, Don. It's for you.	3	8
It's Mr. Hilton's office.	3	8
This is Don.	3	8
Okay. When?	3	8
Tuesday night.	3	8
Pan Am? Sure, send it to my office.	3	8
You as well.	3	8
- Where are you going now? - He wants me to fly out Tuesday night	3	8
- and join him in Rome. - Rome?	3	8
- Well, that's a lot better than Dallas. - Not for two days it isn't.	3	8
I'll see the Colosseum from a taxicab.	3	8
We should've gone to the beach for the summer.	3	8
You've been gone the whole time, anyway.	3	8
First of all, that's not true.	3	8
Second, there's nothing stopping you from coming with me.	3	8
- You have a passport. - I guess our two-month-old isn't an issue.	3	8
We can stay at the Waldorf anytime we want.	3	8
- Because that's just like Rome. - Sorry, Birdie.	3	8
I gotta catch up on my sleep.	3	8
- Okay, you're all set. Stand up. - I am.	3	8
Are you okay?	3	8
- Are you trying to get that in or out? - It's stuck.	3	8
- You work for the Lawrences, right? - I'm very sorry.	3	8
- You're their au pair, aren't you? - Yes, but they will send me home.	3	8
First of all, let's take care of this.	3	8
- What happened? - I can't tell you.	3	8
- Yes, you can. - I can't.	3	8
What's your name?	3	8
- Gudrun. - My name is Peter.	3	8
I'm in 14G. And I'm not going to get you in trouble.	3	8
I have this party and I borrowed her dress and this happened.	3	8
- No one can clean and she's coming home. - So you thought you would throw it away?	3	8
They're just going to think you stole it. Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on.	3	8
I don't think you're thinking clearly.	3	8
You could put it back in the closet, and when she takes it out,	3	8
blame it on the little kids. They have a girl, right?	3	8
I would never do this.	3	8
- When are they coming home? - Thursday.	3	8
- Give it to me. - For what?	3	8
Just give it to me.	3	8
- Let me see what I can do. - Are you sure?	3	8
- And people say New York's not friendly. - Thank you.	3	8
Now, I'm not promising anything. I'll do my best.	3	8
Good night.	3	8
We've read your statement, Mrs. Gumport, and we appreciate your concern.	3	8
- So where is he? We're next. - I don't know.	3	8
- Did he say he was coming? - I didn't speak to him exactly.	3	8
Maybe he sent a letter, a proclamation or something.	3	8
I believe that completes our old business. Move onto the new business on the agenda.	3	8
We will begin with addressing the gas station signs on South Water Street.	3	8
Excuse me. I believe there's been a request for discussion	3	8
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir. It's on the agenda.	3	8
Somehow that got shifted into new business.	3	8
That's definitely old business.	3	8
- Who are you exactly? - She's with me. I'm Mrs. Jack Farrelly,	3	8
and we're representing the Junior League of Tarrytown.	3	8
- Would the trustees please locate the... - There should be two petitions there.	3	8
- Am I late? - No, you're just in time.	3	8
We have someone who'd like to speak on our behalf.	3	8
Yes.	3	8
Yes. Mayor, trustees.	3	8
I'm Henry Francis, Governor Rockefeller's director of public relations and research,	3	8
and I've been sent here to deliver this request on behalf of the governor's office.	3	8
- Really? - It's a request that further study is needed,	3	8
because, as you know, this project was initiated	3	8
based on an assumption that the water quality of the reservoir is lacking.	3	8
I don't think that was an assumption. There was a study.	3	8
With all due respect,	3	8
the governor's office believes that was not conclusive.	3	8
- May I see that letter? - I've brought copies for everyone.	3	8
Very well, Mr. Francis.	3	8
We appreciate the governor's interest in our hamlet,	3	8
and do hereby order the development of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir	3	8
be suspended until further notice.	3	8
Calm down, ladies. I believe that completes our old business.	3	8
Move onto the new business on the agenda.	3	8
I am so impressed.	3	8
- So how long will that report take? - I have no idea,	3	8
"but there's a saying in politics, ""When you have no power, delay. """	3	8
- Betty says you're from around here. - Yeah, about 3 miles that way.	3	8
I have to get out of here before Florence Esterhazi comes out	3	8
- and reiterates the financial report. - I should be getting back as well.	3	8
- Are you driving to Albany? - No.	3	8
Well, I'm this way.	3	8
- They say you can't fight city hall. - Good night, Francine.	3	8
Well, this is me.	3	8
No station wagon for you, I guess.	3	8
I have one. It's just, this was my father's. I thought it would be good luck.	3	8
So.	3	8
So what?	3	8
Nothing.	3	8
I'd love to buy you some coffee, but I don't think there's any place open.	3	8
I appreciate the offer, but I should be getting home.	3	8
I just want to say thank you.	3	8
You really...	3	8
You really did everything we wanted, and I know how busy you must be.	3	8
Well, I think you'll find that I put my heart into things	3	8
when something's important to me.	3	8
Or someone.	3	8
That is a beautiful car.	3	8
He loved it.	3	8
I saw how happy you were in there.	3	8
"- I was. I am. - And I thought, ""Dear God."	3	8
"""Did I have anything to do with that?"""	3	8
Because that would make me happy.	3	8
You did.	3	8
- Good night. - Drive safely now.	3	8
Do you know what happened to the Hilton cufflinks?	3	8
They're little Stetsons, sterling silver.	3	8
They're in my top drawer. Bobby was playing with them. They're fine.	3	8
- Look at that. How'd it go? - It went very well. We won.	3	8
We won, we won, we won!	3	8
- What time are you leaving? - Car comes at 5:45.	3	8
- You're leaving from work? - Yes.	3	8
- So they just killed the whole development? - Not exactly.	3	8
We had completely forgotten this,	3	8
but there's a man from the governor's office,	3	8
and he pointed out something we'd forgotten,	3	8
which was that the whole project was based on the idea	3	8
that the water's no good up there anymore, which is a lie.	3	8
It's not true at all, not even a little. They just made it up.	3	8
So he ordered another study, you know, like a chemical analysis of the water,	3	8
and that could take years, so I think they'll move on.	3	8
They should just do it up in Newburgh. It's already disgusting.	3	8
That's real politics.	3	8
Well, you know, when you don't have any power, you have to delay things.	3	8
Don.	3	8
Don.	3	8
- I'm up. I'm up. - No, it's not time to wake up.	3	8
I want to come with you. Is it too late?	3	8
What? No.	3	8
- I can buy you a ticket at the airport. - Carla can watch them for a few days.	3	8
Sure, why not?	3	8
I know you'll be working the whole time, but I just want to get on a plane.	3	8
Pardon me. Do you work here?	3	8
The men's room is exactly here, one floor down.	3	8
No, I don't need the men's room. I...	3	8
I can't return this. It has this stain here.	3	8
I spilled wine on it and my wife hasn't forgiven me,	3	8
and I'd really appreciate if you could get me out of the doghouse.	3	8
I'm sorry, but anyone could've sewn a tag in this and...	3	8
Do I look like someone who wants to steal a dress?	3	8
- I'll pay for it. - And I was going to say if we did carry it,	3	8
it would be from last season, and I don't know that we still have it.	3	8
- Let me speak to the manager. - Of the entire store?	3	8
Of the republic of dresses.	3	8
Whoever can help me with this, because you're falling short.	3	8
Just a minute.	3	8
- May I help you? - Yes, I...	3	8
Joan! Is that you?	3	8
Yes. Yes, it is. How are you?	3	8
I'm well. Thank you.	3	8
I was asking for the manager. I had no idea.	3	8
Well, I'm just filling in. They needed some extra help.	3	8
- I get my pick before they get put out. - Isn't that smart?	3	8
- So how can I help you? - Well, I don't mean to be a bother,	3	8
I was just hoping someone could. It's this dress.	3	8
Trudy spilled wine on it. She's beside herself.	3	8
I may have spilled the wine,	3	8
and I was hoping to exchange it or replace it,	3	8
whichever will get me out of the ladies dresses department.	3	8
May I?	3	8
It is our merchandise.	3	8
- This one's small. I don't see Trudy in a 10. - It doesn't fit great, but she loves it.	3	8
- It's very... - It's very summery.	3	8
Give me a moment.	3	8
Take this down to customer service. They'll send someone to the stockroom.	3	8
- It'll be boxed up, but I'm sure we have it. - I'm willing to pay for it, of course.	3	8
- It's all taken care of. - Well, that's very generous.	3	8
Thank you. So how are you?	3	8
Never been better. How are things at the office?	3	8
Moneypenny hasn't self-destructed,	3	8
but it's just a matter of time. And how are you?	3	8
I think I told you already. I'm very well. Greg is just finishing up his residency.	3	8
He's actually thinking about a new specialty.	3	8
You know doctors. Whatever's the latest thing.	3	8
And what would that be?	3	8
Psychiatry.	3	8
I'll take the dress and you take that.	3	8
Thank you so much for getting me out of a scrape.	3	8
And I'd appreciate it	3	8
if you should happen to run into Trudy that you be discreet.	3	8
The whole incident was fraught with drama.	3	8
Of course. This never happened.	3	8
Nice to see you again.	3	8
Wow.	3	8
It's beautiful.	3	8
- What is that smell? - Which one?	3	8
It's like rubber or diesel.	3	8
I can barely stand up. Let me see what's going on.	3	8
Sorry. I haven't changed my money yet.	3	8
No, signore. Thank you. American dollar is very good.	3	8
Thank you.	3	8
$2, Don? That's what he makes in a week.	3	8
Don, look.	3	8
- I'm sorry. Is this the Drapers' room? - Yes, this is Mrs. Draper.	3	8
Is it? Well, it's high time I got to meet you.	3	8
This must be Mr. Hilton.	3	8
Connie. Please.	3	8
- Welcome to Rome. - Thank you. I'm happy to be here.	3	8
I want you to put my staff through its traces.	3	8
No complaint's too small. I'd kick you up to a suite,	3	8
but I want Don to see the way this works for most people.	3	8
- It's lovely. - When I see you tonight,	3	8
I want to hear all about it.	3	8
I so, so appreciate this. It's an hour or two at the most.	3	8
The board is trying to jap us with a sudden meeting.	3	8
Ernie, I'm leaving!	3	8
You're drinking alone. This is, in Rome, not in the law.	3	8
Whiskey, neat.	3	8
- May I join you? - Yankee. Hey, go home.	3	8
It's an American millionaire.	3	8
- Are they making fun of me? - A little bit.	3	8
I'm only in Rome for one night. I won't have my heart broken.	3	8
- Room 763. - That's right near my room.	3	8
Good night, signorina.	3	8
- To whatever they were saying. - They said you were ugly.	3	8
Does that bother you?	3	8
You think because of the way I'm dressed that I'm shallow?	3	8
I was just hoping you were easy.	3	8
- They said that, too. - What brings you to Rome?	3	8
Seen anything interesting?	3	8
- I could take it or leave it. - Well, look at the lovebirds, will you?	3	8
Connie, this is my wife, Betty.	3	8
By golly, you are an indecently lucky man.	3	8
By golly, he's nutty.	3	8
He's something.	3	8
He adores you.	3	8
You're tiny.	3	8
He does.	3	8
Now I can see what all the fuss has been about.	3	8
He sees great things in you.	3	8
- Where are we going? - We're going for ice cream.	3	8
That's a grand idea.	3	8
Close your window. My hair is getting mussed.	3	8
- How was your day? - Okay.	3	8
- Do I look pretty? - I guess so.	3	8
Hey, what are you doing?	3	8
Sally and Ernie sitting in a tree.	3	8
K- I-S-S-I-N-G...	3	8
Shut up! I mean it!	3	8
First comes love...	3	8
- Shut up! - Then comes...	3	8
Stop it!	3	8
- I said shut up! - Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!	3	8
- She hurt me. - He hit me first.	3	8
- She was kissing Ernie. - I was not!	3	8
All right! Both of you, separate rooms.	3	8
I'm not gonna let Ernie and Jessica visit anymore.	3	8
Well, aren't you a lucky girl? Go ahead, open it. Make sure it's right.	3	8
It's like new!	3	8
They just exchanged it. No questions asked.	3	8
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Peter, from my heart.	3	8
- I promise I never do this again. - It's all right. It never happened.	3	8
We should celebrate.	3	8
- I don't know. - What do you like to drink?	3	8
You're German, right? I can get us some beer or a Riesling.	3	8
Schnapps?	3	8
You are so nice,	3	8
but I have my boyfriend.	3	8
Thank you so much to do this for me.	3	8
Glad I could help.	3	8
Good night.	3	8
- I woke you. - What do you want?	3	8
I went to a lot of trouble to solve your dress problem,	3	8
and I think I at least deserve to see it on you.	3	8
Okay, but you have to be very quiet.	3	8
- This is cozy. - I'll go get the dress.	3	8
I'd like to kiss you.	3	8
- Hello? - Did I wake you?	3	8
- No. No, I'm up. - Can I interest you two in some breakfast?	3	8
Breakfast? Sure, let me just...	3	8
Stay.	3	8
You know, Connie, Betty's telling me she already ordered breakfast up to the room.	3	8
- Can I meet you afterwards? - Of course.	3	8
You let me know how you like the room service.	3	8
- Did you hear the bells this morning? - I did.	3	8
I like sleeping on this side of the bed.	3	8
I have to get up.	3	8
Order something. He wants a full report.	3	8
Well, hello.	3	8
Welcome home.	3	8
- How is everybody? - Everyone's fine. How was your trip?	3	8
It was short but sweet.	3	8
Well, good. I'm going to get my things.	3	8
Just one more thing.	3	8
- You might want to talk to Sally. - Why?	3	8
- She'll tell you. - Carla, you brought it up.	3	8
I keep talking to her about that temper.	3	8
I'm gonna go check the mail. Do you want anything?	3	8
She kissed Ernie Hanson. Bobby was teasing her, and she really went after him.	3	8
Okay. It's okay.	3	8
- Thank you for telling me. - I think they just missed you.	3	8
Wouldn't that be nice?	3	8
Well, I missed you. You know that?	3	8
Mr. Campbell. Ed Lawrence, 14C.	3	8
Yes, of course. How are you, Ed?	3	8
- Is your wife at home? - No.	3	8
- Can I come in for a minute? - Of course.	3	8
- What are you drinking, Ed? - I have a martini waiting next door.	3	8
Let me make this quick.	3	8
You know we have this German au pair working for us?	3	8
- No, I didn't know that. - Yes, you do.	3	8
- I don't know what she said... - Please, just relax.	3	8
I know it's August and all the cats are away,	3	8
but I just spent one of my precious vacation days refilling the Kleenex boxes.	3	8
- I don't understand. - Would you drop it?	3	8
I've had four months without any tears, Mr. Campbell. Four quiet months.	3	8
You know how hard it is to find someone my wife can get along with?	3	8
And now this.	3	8
Look, there are plenty of nannies in this neighborhood.	3	8
Stay away from her. In fact, be smart. Stay out of the building.	3	8
- I'm very sorry. - It'll be fine.	3	8
Enjoy the rest of your summer.	3	8
- Bobby, sit down. - Mayday! Mayday!	3	8
Daddy doesn't know,	3	8
but Carla told me you were fighting while we were gone.	3	8
Sally.	3	8
- Carla was very upset. - It's not fair. I didn't do anything.	3	8
That's it. You apologize to Bobby and you learn to control your temper,	3	8
or I'm going to have to start taking things away.	3	8
- I'm sorry I hit you. - That's okay.	3	8
I called the office. Hilton sent a packet over before we even left.	3	8
I'm sorry.	3	8
- Going swimming? - Are we?	3	8
Yes.	3	8
See you tonight.	3	8
Yes, but what you really would've enjoyed	3	8
was watching my father struggle with the sailboat.	3	8
Well, hello.	3	8
Hello.	3	8
- Is everybody having a good summer? - Very nice. Very hot.	3	8
I see Marta came. Or did you keep it this way yourself?	3	8
- I did my best. - My little bachelor. Come over here.	3	8
I missed you.	3	8
I missed every part of you.	3	8
- Trudy, I have to get to work. - I don't care.	3	8
Peter.	3	8
You always get that guilty look on your face when we see little children.	3	8
I told you.	3	8
I don't care.	3	8
You're my husband. I want what you want.	3	8
Did you miss me? A little?	3	8
What's wrong?	3	8
Peter. Look at me. Did something happen?	3	8
- Sally, get down here. - Coming.	3	8
I want you to know that I think Ernie Hanson is a very nice little boy,	3	8
but I don't want you running around just kissing boys.	3	8
- I wasn't. - And you don't kiss boys. Boys kiss you.	3	8
The first kiss is very special.	3	8
But I already did it. It's over.	3	8
You're going to have a lot of first kisses.	3	8
You're going to want it to be special, so you remember.	3	8
It's where you go from being a stranger to knowing someone,	3	8
and every kiss with him after that is a shadow of that kiss.	3	8
Do you understand?	3	8
I think so.	3	8
Go play.	3	8
- Hello. - Hello.	3	8
I made some cold salads, hearts of palm, tomatoes, olives.	3	8
Wonderful.	3	8
- Do you want a drink? - No.	3	8
I walked down Lexington and they opened a new fruit market,	3	8
but other than the melons, most of it was unremarkable,	3	8
so I stopped in Butterfield Market	3	8
and they had all of the stone fruits and beautiful cherries and I thought...	3	8
- Trudy. ... maybe I'd make a fruit salad for dessert.	3	8
What?	3	8
I don't want you to go away anymore without me.	3	8
Good. I won't.	3	8
Tell me, what happened at work today?	3	8
Well, Kinsey invented some contraption	3	8
that can shoot a water balloon across the office.	3	8
- We filled it with ketchup. - Did you?	3	8
I have $5 for Carla. She watched the kids for me.	3	8
The board called a secret meeting about the reservoir.	3	8
- I think they reversed us. - Really?	3	8
We'll see.	3	8
- So did you go to the catacombs? - No.	3	8
Throw a coin in the fountain?	3	8
- You did have a good time, didn't you? - You want some?	3	8
The kids didn't eat it at all. I put them to bed.	3	8
Carlton and I went to Lake George for a week after Jess was born.	3	8
No problems, no kids.	3	8
It was magical.	3	8
We have to do that again.	3	8
I'm afraid we may have to be vigilant about the reservoir.	3	8
Although, it'd be an excuse for you to get more help from high places.	3	8
I'm done with that. We made our stand.	3	8
Sunny Madrid. Doesn't that sound like it would do the trick?	3	8
I've never been.	3	8
- Welcome home. - Hello, Francine.	3	8
Well, I should be going.	3	8
From what I hear, you two must be very tired.	3	8
Good night, Francine.	3	8
- Hey. - Don't.	3	8
- What's wrong? - What's wrong?	3	8
I hate this place. I hate our friends.	3	8
- I hate this town. - Betts.	3	8
We'll go away again. You know we will.	3	8
Do me a favor. Look on your pillow.	3	8
Open it.	3	8
I saw it in the gift shop,	3	8
but we were leaving, so I had Connie send it.	3	8
It's lovely.	3	8
I'll have it put on your bracelet.	3	8
Then I can have something to look at	3	8
when I tell the story about the time we went to Rome.	3	8
- Hello? - Do you ever pray on a difficult problem?	3	9
Connie.	3	9
I had this revelation.	3	9
New York City is not a domestic destination like, say, Dallas.	3	9
I'm sorry. What?	3	9
You know, God speaks to us. We have an impulse and we act on it.	3	9
- That's very interesting. - So how do we know to do it, Don?	3	9
How do we know to do something?	3	9
Instinct.	3	9
So, you're just like a dog?	3	9
I knew the patina of the Waldorf would shine over all my domestic properties,	3	9
 but it hasn't worked abroad.	3	9
I know I just gave you New York, but can you help me with that?	3	9
You want me to take your international business, Connie?	3	9
I want you to earn it. A little bit of wow, as a lady friend of mine used to say.	3	9
Let me think on that.	3	9
It sounds like pride, but I want Hiltons all over the world, like missions.	3	9
I want a Hilton on the moon. That's where we're headed.	3	9
Okay.	3	9
America is wherever we look, wherever we're going to be.	3	9
- That's very good, Connie. - You're the one who said that to me.	3	9
Well, I guess it's not that memorable.	3	9
Write up a proposal for the New York Hiltons as convention spaces.	3	9
Send it over to me by noon. I'll take it on the plane.	3	9
Done.	3	9
 Goodbye.	3	9
- I'm sorry about that. - It's okay.	3	9
I don't think the 4:00 a. m. Feedings are over yet.	3	9
"""I want what I want when I want it,"""	3	9
and you don't care what it does to the rest of us.	3	9
Like someone else I know. Yeah.	3	9
Baby's up every three hours. Hilton only calls every four.	3	9
I think you like it.	3	9
What are you doing?	3	9
I can't sleep. I'm going in.	3	9
What are you doing?	3	9
- I'm running. - In the dark?	3	9
It's cool, it's quiet and no one bothers me.	3	9
You're wrong about that.	3	9
Let me give you a ride. Where are you going?	3	9
I'm going home, and the whole idea is to run there.	3	9
Well, take a break. You smoke?	3	9
- The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King... - Take me up to Ross Lane.	3	9
...president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, spoke at the march.	3	9
I have a dream that my four little children...	3	9
- Don't. ... will one day live in a nation	3	9
where they will not be judged by the color of their skin	3	9
but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.	3	9
Two young women were brutally murdered in their Upper East Side apartment...	3	9
When school starts, I'm going to read it to the kids the first day.	3	9
Do you think they can understand it?	3	9
I think they already know it, and it'd be nice for them to hear an adult say it.	3	9
Who are you?	3	9
I mean, dumb or pure?	3	9
Running out here in the middle of the night and I run into you.	3	9
- How did that happen? - What are you doing on the road?	3	9
I don't know. I can't sleep.	3	9
- Right or left? - Just let me out up here.	3	9
- It's a nice house. - I rent the apartment over the garage.	3	9
- Have coffee with me. - You'll be late for work.	3	9
I'm always late. It's coffee.	3	9
Maybe that's why you can't sleep. Too much coffee.	3	9
Good morning.	3	9
Sorry.	3	9
How long have you been there? I had no idea.	3	9
Can you get me some coffee, please? And I need you to type this up	3	9
and get it to Hilton before he leaves for Europe.	3	9
Actually, he's going to California.	3	9
He already left two messages on the service. Do you want me to get him?	3	9
- This. Coffee. Hilton. - Of course.	3	9
- Mr. Draper usually brings this in. - He left early.	3	9
- Can we go outside now? - It's raining. Go upstairs.	3	9
- I did not sleep last night. - Go take a nap. I'll shop in the afternoon.	3	9
It could either be the view of the Acropolis, or just these big columns,	3	9
like you're standing there.	3	9
"Then below it, ""Your window on the world. Hilton,"" period."	3	9
That window looks as old to me as those columns.	3	9
Did anybody look at a picture of the Athens Hilton?	3	9
Sliding doors don't read as windows.	3	9
And believe it or not, we're not allowed to pretend	3	9
that that's the view from the window of the Hilton, because it's not.	3	9
Other than that?	3	9
The tag is flat.	3	9
- Well, that one's yours. - That doesn't make it good.	3	9
If it's bad, don't use it.	3	9
What else?	3	9
There are 16 graphically-perfect reduced photographs of Hilton hotels all on a grid.	3	9
"- Simple headline. - ""Go. We'll meet you anywhere. """	3	9
Now that I can finally understand you, I am less impressed with what you have to say.	3	9
That's your work, too.	3	9
- Who's we? - We are Hilton.	3	9
And how do I know that?	3	9
Take out a magnifying glass and look at one of those tiny hotels?	3	9
"I write ""Hilton"" very big under this Greek."	3	9
There is no deadline.	3	9
I want to see work as you think of it. Give me more ideas to reject.	3	9
I can't do this all by myself.	3	9
- I'm telling you, it's bad for me. - What's that supposed to mean?	3	9
And cut! Well, I think we've finally got it.	3	9
I told you, you had it the first time, if that's what you want.	3	9
And I told you I want what you want.	3	9
- Where is he supposed to be looking? - Onto the horizon.	3	9
We want people to focus on the Lucky.	3	9
- This is what your father signed off on. - Let me see it again.	3	9
Nathaniel, again, please. Watch through the camera.	3	9
That's a good idea.	3	9
Action.	3	9
I just don't know what he's looking at. I want him staring right at us at the end.	3	9
There's a style for the draw on these spots and it's stop, inhale, 1,000-yard stare.	3	9
Tell me what you think.	3	9
I think you're the client and we should do what you want.	3	9
- It can make people very uncomfortable. - Walter Cronkite does it every night.	3	9
Let's take a risk together, shall we, Sally?	3	9
Going again. This time, Nathaniel, on the draw, look right in the lens.	3	9
It's Wednesday, September 4th, and currently 64 degrees in Manhattan.	3	9
We have to get a pencil case.	3	9
- What's wrong with your pencil box? - How was the first day?	3	9
I wish I could've found the camera,	3	9
just so we could see the difference on your face	3	9
from when you left this morning to when I picked you up.	3	9
- So, you like your teacher? - She's okay.	3	9
It's Mrs. Patton. All they do is draw.	3	9
Is this today's mail?	3	9
- I'll get him. - Would you?	3	9
You're so quiet. You must be tired.	3	9
I'm not tired. I really want a pencil case to put in my loose-leaf.	3	9
We'll see.	3	9
Lucky Strike, the hard-working smoke with that smooth and honest taste.	3	9
- Cut. - So, it's a rhythm?	3	9
That's true. Obviously, it'll sound better with the announcer's voice.	3	9
It sounded like you had a half a pastrami in your mouth.	3	9
It's a scratch track. I didn't know you were gonna show it to the client.	3	9
I know I'm supposed to stay away till the screening,	3	9
but I am fascinated by this process.	3	9
You're thinking about getting out of cigarettes and into the movies?	3	9
Not while my father's alive.	3	9
Well, if we rerecord the sound tonight, we can probably finish this.	3	9
I heard you the first time. I'll be in the booth.	3	9
I'd appreciate it if you'd forget all that nonsense I was saying before.	3	9
- What are you talking about? - The movies, my father.	3	9
- Forgotten. - Sorry, but I had a long, wet lunch.	3	9
- Really? Too much to drink. - And other things.	3	9
Secretaries nowadays, they don't give you a choice.	3	9
You know what I mean?	3	9
- I don't have a secretary. - How'd my shot turn out?	3	9
I'm not sure. I think it's gonna feel strange.	3	9
Lucky Strike has a way of doing things. Look at this.	3	9
Yeah, see? I don't think that's so bad.	3	9
Come on. He's not coming back for a while.	3	9
I'll lock the door.	3	9
- I'm married. - So am I.	3	9
- There's been a misunderstanding. - I know what I know.	3	9
Jerry should have the tracks done.	3	9
You can see the whole thing tomorrow or when it's done.	3	9
I'll probably be busy tomorrow.	3	9
I got it. You're at work. That's too bad.	3	9
- How about a nasty old alligator? - He has a point.	3	9
Down, Sue. I'll handle this.	3	9
"""Henry, I'm so pleased there's a place that I can write to you."	3	9
"""The children are finally back in school now, and I must admit"	3	9
"""that I like the idea of looking forward to the mail's arrival every day."	3	9
"""Well, not every day. Ha, ha."	3	9
"""I don't write many letters anymore, so I apologize in advance"	3	9
"""if I'm unable to accurately express my thoughts."	3	9
"""But I do have thoughts,"	3	9
"""and I suppose I wonder too much where you are and what you're doing."	3	9
"""We've only met three times, you know that? Isn't that strange?"	3	9
"""I wish I had a clearer picture of you in my mind."	3	9
"""Anyway, that's all I have to report. I hope to hear from you. B."""	3	9
Don't touch it.	3	9
- I've seen this one. It whitens. - It's not about what you want to watch.	3	9
I have to make sure they run every commercial.	3	9
...pillowcases, socks, towels, everything.	3	9
My mother-in-law says I look like Perry Mason.	3	9
It's not a compliment. It means she thinks you're fat.	3	9
- Crane. - Harry, it's Lee Garner.	3	9
I knew you'd still be there.	3	9
- You work hard, don't you? - For you? You bet.	3	9
Look, I don't want to keep you, but I have a bit of a problem.	3	9
- What's wrong? - It's that Salvatore fellow, the director.	3	9
He's no good. I'd like him gone.	3	9
- What happened? - Well, I can't work with him. Get rid of him.	3	9
- Well, I can't do that. - Excuse me?	3	9
No, I'm not really... I can't. Pete and Roger handle your account.	3	9
No, no. No, no, no, Harry. I want you to take care of this,	3	9
and I want you to keep it just between us.	3	9
Crane, you there?	3	9
Listen, Lee. I hope you know the commercial's turning out beautiful.	3	9
- You really have an eye, you know. - I do, do I?	3	9
- Are you enjoying the city? - I am. Plenty to do.	3	9
Well, you have a good night. I should get back to work.	3	9
- Sorry to trouble you. Good night. - Good night.	3	9
- What was that? - You don't want to know.	3	9
- I think I do. - I can't tell you.	3	9
Now I really do.	3	9
- Lee Garner Jr. Asked me to get rid of Sal. - What'd he do?	3	9
I didn't ask. He was drunk as a skunk and he's scary to begin with.	3	9
What are you gonna do, call Campbell?	3	9
That's the other thing. He said to keep it between us.	3	9
What are you gonna do?	3	9
I'm not gonna panic and do something stupid like I usually do.	3	9
- That's a good start. - I can't really do anything, can I?	3	9
He was really drunk.	3	9
The show's on.	3	9
Great, I missed all the commercials.	3	9
- Hello? - Don, it's Conrad Hilton.	3	9
Is it?	3	9
Now, don't be like that. I know it's a privilege to call you at home.	3	9
I don't think I've worn it out. It's 11:30.	3	9
- It's not a problem, Connie. - Can you come have a drink with me?	3	9
- Right now? - You can say no. I've heard it before.	3	9
And for all you know, you're not the first person I asked.	3	9
I'll be there.	3	9
Give me an hour.	3	9
Hello?	3	9
- So what is that, moonshine? - No, but it is from Prohibition.	3	9
"I have two cases, and they both say ""hair tonic"" on the side."	3	9
I remember this.	3	9
I think you know I'm in a bit of a crisis tonight.	3	9
- I didn't know that. - I think about my business day and night.	3	9
And I'm a harsh critic, especially of myself.	3	9
And sometimes it collects, and I feel bad.	3	9
And then I realize maybe that's the reason I'm so lonesome.	3	9
- You might be working too much. - I'm not working enough.	3	9
It's my purpose in life to bring America to the world,	3	9
whether they like it or not.	3	9
You know, we are a force of good, Don, because we have God.	3	9
Communists don't.	3	9
It's their most important belief. Did you know that?	3	9
I'm not an expert.	3	9
Generosity. The Marshall Plan, you remember that?	3	9
Everyone who saw our ways wanted to be us.	3	9
I'm glad you're telling me this.	3	9
After all the things we threw at Khrushchev, you know what made him fall apart?	3	9
He couldn't get into Disneyland.	3	9
- That's good. - You never heard that?	3	9
Well, I did, but when I hear you say it, it sounds beautiful.	3	9
I don't want any politics in my campaign. You know that.	3	9
But there should be...	3	9
Goodness, and confidence.	3	9
Thanks for listening to me, Don.	3	9
You know, sometimes I look around here,	3	9
"and I think, ""By golly, I'm King Midas. """	3	9
Stop it. You're not.	3	9
You're my angel, you know that? You're like a son.	3	9
In fact, sometimes you're more than a son to me	3	9
because you didn't have what they had,	3	9
and you understand.	3	9
Thank you.	3	9
I mean it.	3	9
Come in, come in, come in.	3	9
I drove all the way down to get the mail, and then I turned around and I debated it.	3	9
- I went past the exit a dozen times, and... - My girl is due back.	3	9
I know I shouldn't be here.	3	9
It's just, I wanted to see you.	3	9
I wasn't thinking.	3	9
- What do I say? Why are you here? - There you are.	3	9
Carla, this is Henry Francis. He works for Governor Rockefeller.	3	9
It's nice to meet you.	3	9
So anyway, I think this is an excellent venue for a fundraiser.	3	9
- Good. I'll have to check with my husband. - Of course.	3	9
Carla, will you show Mr. Francis out? I think I left the bath running.	3	9
- A pleasure to meet you. - You as well.	3	9
I can't get this. Lucy, do you mind?	3	9
Jesus, knock it off.	3	9
It's a Lucky Strike commercial. It's got three cuts in it.	3	9
"So the hillbilly says, ""That ain't my finger. """	3	9
I'm gonna have to hear the beginning of that joke.	3	9
Lee? Lee!	3	9
- What's going on? - I have no idea.	3	9
Does someone know what's going on? Speak up.	3	9
I know.	3	9
Lee Garner Jr. Called me a couple of days ago. I'm sorry.	3	9
- Why is he calling you? - I don't know.	3	9
- He did, and he told me to get rid of Sal. - What?	3	9
And you made an executive decision to do nothing?	3	9
He was really drunk. I thought it would blow over.	3	9
I didn't even think he'd remember.	3	9
When you get in trouble, you call Mommy and Daddy.	3	9
He told me not to tell you, so what was I supposed to do?	3	9
Everyone's an account man. What exactly do you think we do here, Crane?	3	9
We handle clients.	3	9
- He wouldn't say a word. He just left. - Sal, you're fired.	3	9
- Are you serious? - Lee Garner Jr. Wants you fired.	3	9
We're gonna find out what he wants to do with you, imbecile.	3	9
- Oh, God. - What the hell happened?	3	9
What is going on?	3	9
Now, you're gonna use your dying breath to tell Don to fix this.	3	9
- Don? - Lee Garner has a problem with creative,	3	9
let Don solve it. He does it all now anyway. Now!	3	9
- What did Lee say to you? - Nothing. I have to talk to Don.	3	9
- Let me talk to Don. - I'm doing as I'm told. Is he busy?	3	9
I can see you and I can hear you. What do you want?	3	9
Who died?	3	9
- I screwed up with Lee Garner Jr. - What?	3	9
- How do I explain this? - He told Harry to fire me.	3	9
- Harry? - I didn't, but now Roger did.	3	9
- Roger did what? - He fired me.	3	9
Roger said to tell you to fix it. Those are his words.	3	9
Fantastic.	3	9
That's a $25 million account you stuck your nose in, Crane.	3	9
Just get out.	3	9
What happened?	3	9
Lee Garner got drunk, and he told Harry to fire me,	3	9
and then Roger got angry and he did. I think if I get away from Lucky Strike	3	9
and lay low from Roger for a day or two, everything will be fine.	3	9
I understand what just happened. What happened with the cut?	3	9
- The commercial's fine. - Sal, something must've happened.	3	9
I can't help you unless you tell me.	3	9
- We had a misunderstanding. - Jesus. I'm not gonna ask again.	3	9
He was drunk, and he cornered me in the editing room.	3	9
- Cornered you? - Yes.	3	9
And I backed him off, I told him I was married,	3	9
and he was embarrassed and he left.	3	9
- You must've been really shocked. - I was, believe me.	3	9
But nothing happened,	3	9
because nothing could have happened because you're married?	3	9
- Don, I swear on my mother's life. - You sure you want to do that?	3	9
Who do you think you're talking to?	3	9
I guess I was just supposed to do whatever he wanted?	3	9
What if it was some girl?	3	9
That would depend on what kind of girl it was and what I knew about her.	3	9
You people.	3	9
I didn't do anything but turn him down.	3	9
He's a bully.	3	9
Lucky Strike can shut off our lights.	3	9
I think you know that this is the way this has to be.	3	9
You'll do fine.	3	9
Get me Lee Garner Jr.	3	9
I said I don't want salad.	3	9
Watch your tone, young man. Carla works for me, not you.	3	9
- What do you want instead? - You might as well call it a day.	3	9
Okay. Thank you.	3	9
- Hi, Daddy. - Hi.	3	9
How was your day?	3	9
Not good.	3	9
I didn't want to bother you with it, but that man dropped by today	3	9
from the governor's office. Carla met him.	3	9
Francine sent him over here.	3	9
They want to have a fundraiser, but her house isn't big enough.	3	9
I don't care, as long as I don't have to go. When is it?	3	9
Well, I should be going.	3	9
Soon. Next week, I think.	3	9
- A fundraiser for Rockefeller. - For the campaign.	3	9
- I'm gonna go lay down. Good night, Carla. - Good night.	3	9
- Good night, children. - Good night.	3	9
Bye.	3	9
Good night, Mrs. Draper.	3	9
If you're here, do I have to be here? Because I'm leaving.	3	9
- No, go ahead. - Good night, boss.	3	9
- Henry Francis. - Hello. I thought I'd get the service.	3	9
This is Betty Draper.	3	9
I know that. Listen, I shouldn't have come by like that.	3	9
- I hope I'm not calling too late. - No, you're not.	3	9
I checked with my husband about the fundraiser.	3	9
- The fundraiser? - Yes, we'd be glad to do that.	3	9
How's Tuesday the 17th? Can you make it then? Is that good for you?	3	9
Okay. I guess you're going through with this.	3	9
I had to.	3	9
I'll have my girl call you tomorrow to make it official.	3	9
I look forward to it. Let me know what's usually provided by the host.	3	9
Sure.	3	9
Goodbye.	3	9
Good night, Betty.	3	9
Rome, Tehran, Tokyo are magnificent destinations,	3	9
and that's really been the focus of almost every campaign you've had	3	9
up till now. How to lure the American traveler abroad.	3	9
What more do we need than a picture of Athens to get our hearts racing?	3	9
And yet the average American experiences a level of luxury	3	9
that belongs only to kings in most of the world.	3	9
We're not chauvinists. We just have expectations.	3	9
Well, now there's one word that promises the thrill of international travel	3	9
with the comfort of home. Hilton.	3	9
"""How do you say ice water in Italian? Hilton. """	3	9
"""How do you say fresh towels in Farsi? Hilton. """	3	9
"""How do you say hamburger in Japanese? Hilton. """	3	9
"""Hilton. "" It's the same in every language."	3	9
"Maybe fried chicken. I don't like the sound of ""hamburger"" and ""Hilton. """	3	9
"Besides, ""hamburger"" is already a foreign word."	3	9
We'll see.	3	9
It's good. Very good.	3	9
It's clever, yet friendly. Draws you in.	3	9
But what about the moon?	3	9
- Excuse me? - There's nothing about the moon.	3	9
Well, right now, that's not an actual destination.	3	9
That wasn't the point. I said I wanted Hilton on the moon.	3	9
I couldn't have been more clear about it.	3	9
Well, I'll admit I misunderstood that. I'm sure there's a way to fit that into this.	3	9
Well, isn't this something?	3	9
I'd like to speak with Don in private.	3	9
This is a good campaign, one of the best.	3	9
It's modern, it's witty, it's eye-catching. It will change your business.	3	9
Calm down. I'm going to speak very honestly with you.	3	9
I don't think folks do that often. Probably scared.	3	9
Or they trust my work.	3	9
You want me to just say yes to everything you do?	3	9
Most ad men believe that clients are the thing that gets in the way of good work.	3	9
I've never experienced that.	3	9
You did not give me what I wanted.	3	9
I'm deeply disappointed, Don.	3	9
This is a great campaign.	3	9
Fine. What do you want from me? Love? Your work is good.	3	9
But when I say I want the moon, I expect the moon.	3	9
- I said if he ran, I'd support him. - I haven't decided yet.	3	9
I voted for Kennedy. I'll probably vote for him again.	3	9
What a nice turnout.	3	9
- Where's Henry Francis? - I don't know. Someone's supposed to talk.	3	9
I don't know anything about Rockefeller. That's why I did this.	3	9
Well, I want to know how he's gonna deal with the South.	3	9
Do you know how bad it must be for the negroes	3	9
to descend on Washington like that just to be heard?	3	9
Segregation is uncivilized. It's that simple.	3	9
"You know what my father says about the South? ""It's not 1963, it's 1863."""	3	9
Thank you.	3	9
Mrs. Draper, I'm Elsa Kittridge and I work with Mr. Francis.	3	9
Pleasure to meet you. I assume he's been delayed.	3	9
Actually he asked that I address the group on behalf of the governor.	3	9
That's disappointing.	3	9
I mean, I don't think it's going to help your fundraising	3	9
when you promise one thing and deliver another.	3	9
Well, perhaps you're right,	3	9
but he seemed to think I was a better match to the group,	3	9
and I am extremely informed.	3	9
In fact, I'm the person who briefs Mr. Francis.	3	9
I think you'll see I won't embarrass you in front of your friends.	3	9
- Please, begin whenever you want. - No, you begin, dear.	3	9
Excuse me, my name is Betty Draper. Welcome to my home.	3	9
- We're going to listen to... - Elsa Kittridge,	3	9
Associate in the Governor's Information Office.	3	9
First I would like to dispel the rumor that there is a mandatory contribution tonight.	3	9
This is a taking of a pulse, an exchange of ideas.	3	9
Please see that we're not disturbed.	3	9
Hey!	3	9
Mr. Francis, do you need anything?	3	9
- No, Marjorie, I dropped something. - Where were you last night?	3	9
- Calm down. - Why didn't you come?	3	9
Why did you send that woman?	3	9
- I watched the door all night like a sap. - I'm sorry, but I wanted you to come to me.	3	9
- The ego. - Would you listen to me?	3	9
- You had to come to me. - And why is that?	3	9
Because you're married.	3	9
No, Henry.	3	9
What's wrong?	3	9
Please. We're locked in this office.	3	9
What? On the desk? On the couch?	3	9
- We should get a room somewhere. - No.	3	9
It's tawdry.	3	9
I'm sorry.	3	9
I'm very sorry. I started this.	3	9
I don't know what you want.	3	9
Goodbye.	3	9
- Mr. Sterling's here to see you. - Send him in.	3	9
I heard Conrad Hilton left this building in a huff yesterday.	3	9
Who told you that?	3	9
You've got your face so deep in Hilton's lap, you're ignoring everything else.	3	9
- Everything's under control. - You won't even let me meet the man.	3	9
What do you think accounts does, besides limit your brilliance?	3	9
I'd tell you, but I don't want to hurt your feelings.	3	9
Keep joking about it.	3	9
We've had two clients in one week leave here angry. Important clients.	3	9
Is that what you want this place to be known for?	3	9
That and some guy losing his foot in a lawnmower?	3	9
I want to put you on notice, you are in over your head.	3	9
These children,	3	9
unoffending, innocent and beautiful,	3	9
were the victims of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes	3	9
ever perpetrated against humanity.	3	9
You can leave it on your station. I don't mind.	3	9
- It's all right. - What was that?	3	9
The funeral service for the little girls in Birmingham.	3	9
It's so horrifying.	3	9
Are you okay? Do you need a day off?	3	9
No, I'm fine. Thank you.	3	9
I hate to say this, but it's really made me wonder about civil rights.	3	9
Maybe it's not supposed to happen right now.	3	9
- Hello, Mr. Draper. - Hello.	3	9
You just missed bedtime. They're probably still awake.	3	9
No, don't bother with dinner. We got Chinese takeout.	3	9
Listen, Marty needs me to look over this work.	3	9
Don't wait up for me.	3	9
I love you, too.	3	9
Betts.	3	9
What?	3	9
Hilton just called. I'm going in.	3	9
I didn't hear the phone.	3	9
Go back to sleep.	3	9
- Someone's going to see you. - Then let me in.	3	9
This is nice.	3	9
What can I do for you?	3	9
I don't know. I wanted to talk.	3	9
Right. Says the man as he unbuckles his pants.	3	9
What do you want me to say? You've been flirting with me for months.	3	9
- So what? - So, I can't stop thinking about you.	3	9
Because I'm new and different. Or maybe I'm exactly the same.	3	9
Tell me you've run past that stretch of highway in the past two weeks	3	9
and not thought of me,	3	9
not looked for me.	3	9
But then I have the luxury of that last half-mile home	3	9
where I go through every step of the future until it ends.	3	9
I know exactly how it ends.	3	9
So what?	3	9
You live two miles from here. Your daughter was my student.	3	9
I've seen your wife in the market.	3	9
I don't think you've done this before this way.	3	9
I want you.	3	9
I don't care. Doesn't that mean anything to someone like you?	3	9
- Butter. - And the apples are good now,	3	10
but not from the market.	3	10
I can go to Rodney Farms on Sunday. It's near church.	3	10
- Can't we go to Rodney Farms? - We'll see.	3	10
- Why don't we go to church? - We go to church.	3	10
On Christmas.  Carla goes every Sunday.	3	10
We don't need to go every week.	3	10
Anything else?	3	10
- It's early. Do you want a drink? - Yes.	3	10
- How was school today? - Good.	3	10
How come you never ask me?	3	10
 I do. It's just your answer is always longer, so I thought I would start with Sally.	3	10
When's Halloween?	3	10
Before Thanksgiving. Francine and Carlton have invited us,	3	10
but I think if we're going to be selling Daddy's house,	3	10
I don't know, it might be nice to have it there one last time.	3	10
Are you going to sleep here tonight?	3	10
No.	3	10
You're working too much.	3	10
- Betts, I don't have a choice. - No, that's not what I mean. I just...	3	10
I see how hard you're working.	3	10
Hello.	3	10
Inside.	3	10
- Were you grading papers? - Why?	3	10
I don't know if you're hungry, but I made date nut bread.	3	10
 Actually, I made three. Bake sale.	3	10
Your service called. Mr. Hilton was looking for you,	3	10
but he's probably in the air right now.	3	10
Thanks, Miss Farrell. That's good to know.	3	10
I thought so.	3	10
I want you to spend the whole night.	3	10
You couldn't possibly be asleep already.	3	10
This eight-year-old, Charlie,	3	10
looked up at me during art today and said,	3	10
"""How do I know if what I see as blue is the same as it is to you?"""	3	10
What did you say?	3	10
The truth. I don't know.	3	10
I never have,	3	10
but I love that he made me think about that again.	3	10
What would you have said?	3	10
I would have told Charlie	3	10
that my job is about	3	10
boiling down communication to its essentials,	3	10
and that I know that there is a blue	3	10
that at least 45% of the population sees as the same.	3	10
Maybe half those people think they're looking at yellow.	3	10
Maybe, but the truth is, people may see things differently,	3	10
but they don't really want to.	3	10
Do you feel bad about what you do?	3	10
Nobody feels as good about what they do as you do.	3	10
That's sweet.	3	10
I wish I could've known you at eight. I bet you were serious.	3	10
And I would've liked you.	3	10
Long curly hair.	3	10
No one has it anymore.	3	10
- Why don't you take her? - Because I said no.	3	10
- You'd rather not go than go with me? - What do you think Mr. Draper would say	3	10
if you showed up at the Sterling Cooper 40th with his secretary?	3	10
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	3	10
- Coffee? - Morning, Don.	3	10
Morning, fellas. Yes.	3	10
- Aqua Net, 9:00. - Get Peggy.	3	10
Don, if you could stand over there.	3	10
It's Paul Kinsey theater.	3	10
This was my thought.	3	10
Aqua Net is about hold, but it's also about beauty.	3	10
"So, we're driving. Two couples. I call it ""Double Date. """	3	10
The woman in the back's scarf blows off and her hair starts blowing.	3	10
- Her hairdo falls apart. - Oh, no!	3	10
And then the woman in front takes off her scarf	3	10
and hands it back to the woman in the back.	3	10
"- Take mine. - And he says, ""Are you sure, Marcia?"""	3	10
Marcia's hair is perfect.	3	10
And then her date gives her a knowing smile of admiration	3	10
on her confident smile.	3	10
"""Aqua Net. Arrive in style. """	3	10
"Too much story. Every time I hear, ""And then,"""	3	10
there's another chance for the ladies at home to misunderstand.	3	10
What if it's just the two couples, the wind is blowing,	3	10
the woman in the back has to put on her kerchief	3	10
and she just looks longingly at Miss Perfect in front?	3	10
"- Okay. - ""Arrive in style"" still works."	3	10
And at the end, you could see the can with a kerchief,	3	10
like a see-through one over it	3	10
and the wind blows it off to reveal the Aqua Net.	3	10
A kerchief in a can?	3	10
Don't use that, but very nice.	3	10
Well, great, then.	3	10
- What do you have for Western Union? - We don't meet until next week.	3	10
Hilton takes precedence,	3	10
so I need you two to be ready for me at a moment's notice.	3	10
And it has to be TV to compete with the phone company.	3	10
I love getting telegrams, but I never send them.	3	10
How is that supposed to help?	3	10
I've got it.	3	10
My goodness. This is where everyone is.	3	10
Allison, my dear, do you mind?	3	10
All the paperwork is through on your contract.	3	10
It is my pleasure to deliver your signing bonus personally.	3	10
You see, I don't just fire people.	3	10
So we finally have an answer to the question,	3	10
"""What makes Don Draper smile?"" $5,000 seems to be the number."	3	10
I don't know why it took two months.	3	10
Will your amigo Connie Hilton be attending the anniversary party Friday?	3	10
- In his dressiest Stetson. - Splendid.	3	10
You will be speaking last. It's prime time. Please prepare.	3	10
I'm sorry to interrupt. Mr. Pryce, your wife is here	3	10
and has requested your attention immediately.	3	10
- Where? - Your office.	3	10
- What's going on? - I'll find out.	3	10
No, it's okay.	3	10
- Mr. Kinsey to see you. - What was that?	3	10
Thank you, Olive. What?	3	10
I don't need you to put your little swirl on top of my idea.	3	10
- No one's keeping score. - I am.	3	10
And every time we work together, it looks like you carried the load	3	10
because you're spontaneous, and you're a girl,	3	10
and you're his favorite and you use Aqua Net.	3	10
- Are you nuts? He hates me. - That's rich.	3	10
Wearing a dress isn't gonna help you with Western Union.	3	10
You do your work. I'll do mine. Let the chips fall where they may.	3	10
Mrs. Pryce, your water.	3	10
- Thank you ever so much, John. - Will there be anything else?	3	10
- He's such a toad. - He is. He is. Darling, please, sit down.	3	10
No. I'm not going to let you force me to do anything anymore.	3	10
Am I to entertain your ballad of dissatisfaction,	3	10
or has something actually happened? Because I am at work, dear.	3	10
I'm so sorry.	3	10
I went to pick up my gown.	3	10
The queue for the taxi was 10 long with those fat ladies in their furs.	3	10
Finally I think I'm en route, but I see the park,	3	10
and I insist it's the wrong direction,	3	10
and he's obviously running up my fare, which he was.	3	10
- I'm so sorry, darling. - I had to stop here	3	10
because I'd already taken a $2.25 tour of Harlem	3	10
- and that was all the money I had. - We'll get you home right away.	3	10
Do you have enough cash to get me to London?	3	10
Because this is not my home.	3	10
- These things take time. - Not for you.	3	10
"If a superior demands that you be happy, you say, ""Yes, sir. Right away, sir. """	3	10
Go on. Let's have it all, shall we?	3	10
You like it here.	3	10
The smells and the noise and the criminals at every level.	3	10
I have made the best of this.	3	10
My salary is good. The company is flourishing.	3	10
My wife has a beautiful gown.	3	10
May I see it?	3	10
It's not London.	3	10
- It's not even England. - That's true.	3	10
I've been here 10 months and no one's ever asked me	3	10
where I went to school.	3	10
- I want to scream. - Don't.	3	10
Roll over.	3	10
- Just a minute! - Why did you answer?	3	10
I had to see you.	3	10
I called you from the bus station in New Haven	3	10
before I started hitching. You never answered.	3	10
I'm so sorry. Can you give me a minute?	3	10
- It's my brother. - Get rid of him for 15 minutes. I'll run out.	3	10
No, it's okay, Don. Come outside.	3	10
No. So there's a man in here. He doesn't need to know it's me.	3	10
I want you to meet him.	3	10
I don't want to ruin this.	3	10
It's okay.	3	10
I promise.	3	10
Danny, I'd like you to meet my friend Don.	3	10
- Sorry to interrupt. - Danny, be polite.	3	10
I really am sorry.	3	10
- What happened there? - Is it bad under there? Are you hungry?	3	10
- No. - Well, I should be going.	3	10
Listen, I know what it looks like, but I'm not a junkie.	3	10
Although apparently I'm too dangerous to push a cart in a public library.	3	10
- He has fits. - I'm sorry.	3	10
I interrupted you. It's a nice night.	3	10
- I'll see you in the morning, Suzy. - Stop it.	3	10
- I wish you the best. - You don't even know me.	3	10
- I'll call you. - Tomorrow.	3	10
He could've just stayed inside your bedroom.	3	10
I wanted you two to meet. You're my baby brother.	3	10
Well, he knows how to leave a room. Reminds me of Mom.	3	10
- He's just very private. - He's arrogant. His plans were interrupted.	3	10
You don't know him.	3	10
I'm going to get you another job. Someplace safe.	3	10
Safe.	3	10
Other people are the problem. Name such a place.	3	10
People are ignorant.	3	10
They're scared of things they don't understand.	3	10
I'm really hungry.	3	10
1923. We were giddy.	3	10
We didn't know the soup was gonna hit the fan,	3	10
- but we made it through. - All these guys are dead.	3	10
Except you, of course.	3	10
And Doug Thompson, but I wish he were. He let me eat a whole roll of Bolls Laxatives.	3	10
I thought they were candies. I want him to show up and keel over.	3	10
Damn it. I don't want to go to another funeral.	3	10
Well, I'm not really gonna kill him. I just would like to, that's all.	3	10
Fortieth anniversary. Forty would be an insignificant year	3	10
were it not the average lifespan of a man in this business.	3	10
I don't think it's a bad idea to have a chance to out-drink your clientele.	3	10
Who am I kidding? I don't want to go either.	3	10
Have to watch Don Draper accept an award for his humanity?	3	10
- Don is important. - You know, I found that guy	3	10
working in a fur company, night school.	3	10
And that girl, Betty.	3	10
I remember Mona said they looked like they were on top of our wedding cake.	3	10
- Screw him. - Have the party without me. I can't do it.	3	10
I won't.	3	10
Okay. Okay.	3	10
It's just a party. If you don't want to go, you don't have to go.	3	10
It's not like it's our company anymore anyway.	3	10
My God. Remember her?	3	10
It's 100,000 bucks...	3	10
- Can I? - If you do it right.	3	10
Hello, Draper residence.	3	10
Hello?	3	10
There's nobody there. They hanged up.	3	10
Hang it up.	3	10
Why'd they hang up?	3	10
Probably a wrong number. People do it all the time.	3	10
But I could hear somebody and they heard me.	3	10
My goodness, Sally Draper, try not to take everything so personally.	3	10
Jeez Louise.	3	10
The phone is cheap. It's everyday, and you can't trust it.	3	10
The telegraph is honest and solid and clear. It's old, but it's good.	3	10
Traditional.	3	10
Sorry about that, Olive.	3	10
Peggy.	3	10
- Peggy! - Hello?	3	10
- Did you see a girl come through here? - No, sir.	3	10
- I'm Paul, by the way. - I'm Achilles.	3	10
Achilles. Well, hello, Achilles.	3	10
- Are you okay? - Are you Greek?	3	10
- I'm an American citizen. - No, of course.	3	10
It's just, that's a mighty big name.	3	10
- How did that happen? - Well, it's been in my family for generations.	3	10
"When we have a party and someone says, ""Achilles,"""	3	10
all the men turn their heads.	3	10
- In fact, one Christmas... - Hush.	3	10
I've got it.	3	10
You've got what?	3	10
Achilles, I have thought of something very, very good.	3	10
- Glad to hear it. - It's truly great news.	3	10
- Yeah, your whole face changed. - Did it?	3	10
Well, I think I shall sleep very soundly tonight. I wish you the same.	3	10
Is that taken?	3	10
Hey.	3	10
I'll only stay for a stop. I tried to catch you on the platform.	3	10
- What are you doing here? - I needed to talk to you.	3	10
Did you call my house last night?	3	10
No, I didn't.	3	10
- This was a mistake. - Sit down.	3	10
I'm sorry.	3	10
You said you'd call me.	3	10
Your brother is there.	3	10
I don't care about your marriage or your work or any of that,	3	10
as long as I know you're with me.	3	10
I'm sorry.	3	10
I got him a job at the VA Hospital in Bedford.	3	10
He'll be pushing a broom, but it has nice grounds.	3	10
You can come by tonight. He'll be gone.	3	10
- Are you sure? - Stop it.	3	10
Scarborough! Briarcliff Manor!	3	10
Scarborough! Briarcliff Manor!	3	10
It was nice meeting you.	3	10
Mr. Kinsey.	3	10
Paul!	3	10
Sorry to wake you. It's 9:00 a. m.	3	10
- Good morning, Lois. - Good morning.	3	10
I need you to type something for me.	3	10
- Were you in here before? - No.	3	10
- So you haven't touched anything? - No.	3	10
You do that sometimes.	3	10
- What was it? - Does it look like I know?	3	10
I wrote it down.	3	10
I know I wrote it down.	3	10
Did you find it? It's always the last place you look.	3	10
My mother always said to retrace your steps if you lost something.	3	10
Good God, would you shut up?	3	10
"""In conclusion, with the help of Sterling Cooper,"	3	10
"""its ingenuity and influence,"	3	10
"""America is teaching business to the world. """	3	10
Very rousing, sir.	3	10
Churchill rousing or Hitler rousing?	3	10
Mr. Pryce's office.	3	10
Just a moment, please.	3	10
London calling. Mr. Ford.	3	10
- Harold. - Just calling for a status report	3	10
on our little party.	3	10
All is well, although as of late, Bert Cooper will be in absentia.	3	10
Well, that won't do.	3	10
We're flying across the pond. We expect all the flowers in the vase.	3	10
- What does that mean? - Look, Lane,	3	10
we've had interest in the company for some months	3	10
and this party is essential to attracting a second suitor.	3	10
For what purpose?	3	10
Did we reach you at a bad time? You seem foggy.	3	10
- Saint John here. - Hello.	3	10
Lane, Sterling Cooper is for sale.	3	10
But why?	3	10
We've reduced the staff and increased the revenue by 22%.	3	10
I think you've answered your own question. We need this party to encourage interest.	3	10
- Do your best, lad. - Yes, of course.	3	10
- Are you quite all right, sir? - Yes. That'll be all.	3	10
Henry Francis, please. It's Betty Draper.	3	10
How are you? What a nice surprise.	3	10
I was wondering if you called my home last night.	3	10
No. No, I didn't.	3	10
Well, we had a hang-up. I thought it might be you.	3	10
Really?	3	10
I'm terribly embarrassed.	3	10
Do you want me to call you?	3	10
- No. - But you thought it was me.	3	10
What are you laughing at?	3	10
I didn't call you and I'm not going to, but if you're gonna call me, call me.	3	10
Don't make up excuses.	3	10
I'm not playing a game here.	3	10
- Goodbye. - Goodbye, Betty.	3	10
Try to look at this from Monica's point of view.	3	10
- Do you mind? This is rather serious. - Go ahead.	3	10
Monica wants to get married with or without Jimmy...	3	10
It has come to my attention	3	10
that you're not attending the Sterling Cooper 40th anniversary.	3	10
I wouldn't have told Roger if I planned on it remaining a secret.	3	10
In Great Britain	3	10
we have a good deal of testimonials,	3	10
and the senior members are all equally unenthused.	3	10
It marks the passage of time. It's painful, I imagine.	3	10
I didn't get to where I am by dwelling on the past.	3	10
So think of the future, all of our clients, all of our staff,	3	10
the press, newspapers and trade publications.	3	10
Enjoy the fruit of your longevity.	3	10
You really pour the honey on, then you lick it off.	3	10
Well, if you care about Sterling Cooper at all,	3	10
remember that your absence will make everyone think you are ill.	3	10
Who told you I was vain?	3	10
Please.	3	10
It's obvious.	3	10
I want to show Mommy. Mommy!	3	10
- Maybe she's not here. - Carla.	3	10
- Are you feeling all right? - I'm fine.	3	10
I want you to take the children to the park. Don't come home...	3	10
Just... Dinnertime would be perfect. Take them to the library.	3	10
Hello.	3	10
I'm glad to see you.	3	10
Sorry again.	3	10
We were gonna leave after school and I am still here, obviously.	3	10
You want to wait here for me? He has to report tomorrow.	3	10
Let me do it. Let me drive him.	3	10
- Where are you going again? - Bedford, Mass.	3	10
- It's a long drive, Don. - And you'll have to come back alone.	3	10
Let me do this for you.	3	10
I don't want to say goodbye up there. It's gonna come out ungrateful.	3	10
There's $375 there, okay?	3	10
How many times have you done this?	3	10
Don't you need to gas up?	3	10
- No, we're fine. - So you're not gonna stop?	3	10
Do you need to stop?	3	10
I have some movie in my head where I give you the slip,	3	10
but I might as well tell you. I'm not going to Bedford.	3	10
Well, I am, so I guess you kind of have to.	3	10
Why do you care? You're just gonna go back and screw her.	3	10
I don't know if you're capable of understanding,	3	10
- but that job is important. - Did you get me the job?	3	10
- No. - So shut up.	3	10
I'm not retarded. Julius Caesar had epilepsy. He ran Rome.	3	10
Things didn't turn out so well for him.	3	10
I know what's waiting for me at that place. I'm 25 years old, Don.	3	10
I don't want to be cleaning toilets until I die.	3	10
Just pull over.	3	10
- Hold on. - What?	3	10
I'm older than you,	3	10
and I'm telling you it seems bad now, but you can still change things.	3	10
- Pull myself up by the bootstraps? - Does that just sound stupid to you?	3	10
How do I explain this?	3	10
I can't do anything that you can do.	3	10
Everyone knows, sooner or later, that there's something wrong with me.	3	10
They're kind and they try,	3	10
but then when I come to with piss in my pants,	3	10
they stare at me like I'm from another planet.	3	10
I am afflicted, okay?	3	10
It's not a question of will. I can't change that.	3	10
- Do you need money? - Always.	3	10
I swore to myself I would try to do this right once.	3	10
Do what?	3	10
I want you to call me if you ever need to.	3	10
And I want you to remember,	3	10
if something happens to you, your sister will never forgive herself.	3	10
You're not gonna tell her, are you?	3	10
That I let you out 20 miles outside of Framingham?	3	10
Take care.	3	10
I know he thought I was passing him off, but he means the world to me.	3	10
He knows that.	3	10
What was the place like?	3	10
- Nice. - Bullshit.	3	10
He'll be as good as he can be.	3	10
Don, I don't want to.	3	10
I don't.	3	10
It's okay.	3	10
- Coffee? - No.	3	10
Can you get my wife on the phone?	3	10
- Betty. - Where were you last night?	3	10
- I told you, I was with Hilton. - Well, I must have forgotten.	3	10
Well, did you remember to pick up my tuxedo?	3	10
Yesterday. It's in the closet.	3	10
I'll get home at 5:30. We should leave within the hour.	3	10
I don't know. I don't know if I'm going to go.	3	10
"- What's wrong? - ""What's wrong?"""	3	10
"""What's wrong?"""	3	10
I don't feel well.	3	10
Get into bed and grab a hot water bottle. You have seven hours.	3	10
It's all the clients and all the partners, and they're all expecting me to show up	3	10
with the glamorous, elegant, stunning Betty Draper.	3	10
I want to show you off, Betts.	3	10
Okay.	3	10
You ready? Don's expecting us.	3	10
I've got nothing.	3	10
- What a relief. Mine's garbage, too. - No, I had something,	3	10
something incredible, but I lost it.	3	10
I didn't write it down.	3	10
- I hate that. - It might've been the best idea I ever had.	3	10
I did everything. I talked to Achilles.	3	10
I spent last night recreating every detail of the evening,	3	10
hoping it would come back.	3	10
You know how it is. There was nothing and then there was it,	3	10
- and now it's nothing again. - I'm so sorry.	3	10
- How do you talk to Achilles? - He's a janitor with a very bad memory.	3	10
You know what the Chinese say?	3	10
"""The faintest ink is better than the best memory. """	3	10
Come on. We've failed before.	3	10
Okay, we really looked for advantages.	3	10
One of them is, phone calls happen every day.	3	10
"A telegram's a big deal. Something like, ""She's getting married."	3	10
"""Are you really just going to give her a call?"""	3	10
Sounds like you're talking to her parents. They should really be at that wedding.	3	10
Also, old people love them.	3	10
"- ""When you care, send one there. "" - That's a slogan, not an idea. Paul?"	3	10
- Mine aren't any better. - Damn it, Kinsey. What's your excuse?	3	10
- Don't yell at him. - Excuse me?	3	10
Tell him what happened.	3	10
No.	3	10
The dog ate my homework. I had a great idea and I lost it.	3	10
I didn't write it down.	3	10
I hate when that happens.	3	10
I keep thinking about that Chinese thing you said. What was it?	3	10
"""The faintest ink is better than the best memory. """	3	10
It just makes me think... You call someone on the phone,	3	10
"""Hello, I'm getting married"" or, ""Congratulations on the baby,"""	3	10
and then you hang up. It's gone.	3	10
It's different if you send a telegram. A telegram is permanent.	3	10
"Something like, ""A telegram is forever. """	3	10
"""You can't frame a phone call. """	3	10
My God.	3	10
That's the way to go. You two keep working on that.	3	10
When do you want it?	3	10
The party's tonight. Monday.	3	10
See? It all works out.	3	10
Betts, are you ready?	3	10
- The car's downstairs. - The driver's Chinese.	3	10
Ready, Betts?	3	10
Look how pretty Mommy is.	3	10
- Where are we going? - The Waldorf Astoria, Mummy.	3	10
Well, then we passed it. It's on Fifth Avenue.	3	10
It's on Park. Moved years ago.	3	10
That's right. That's right. When did they ever do that?	3	10
Enjoy the world as it is, Margaret.	3	10
They'll change it and never give you a reason.	3	10
Mummy, she's not Margaret, she's Jane. She's my wife.	3	10
- Does Mona know? - Yes, she knows.	3	10
You seem surprised that there's traffic. There's always traffic.	3	10
Calm yourself. We'll arrive when we arrive.	3	10
- They're selling the company. - What?	3	10
They're selling Sterling Cooper.	3	10
- When? - I have no idea.	3	10
- What happens to the Americans? - They'll go to the highest bidder.	3	10
I know you hate uncertainty,	3	10
but take comfort in the fact that we'll return to England.	3	10
I'm gonna keep going on and make Don Draper wait,	3	10
because God knows we've all waited for him.	3	10
As if being decorated for his service in Korea weren't enough,	3	10
his career has yielded even more awards.	3	10
The American Association of Advertising Agencies' Arthur Kudner Award,	3	10
Printers' Ink magazine's advertising gold medal,	3	10
the Advertising Writers Association of New York... I'm not reading all of these.	3	10
He's loyal, charming, quiet but not modest. Why should he be?	3	10
We have to thank his beautiful wife, Betty,	3	10
and his three children, for sharing him with us,	3	10
because as we all know, sometimes Sterling Cooper has gotten the lion's share.	3	10
Bert Cooper and my father, Roger Sterling Sr.,	3	10
bravely set this in motion 40 years ago.	3	10
And now let me introduce the man	3	10
who will stand alongside me for the next 40 years,	3	10
our creative director, partner, father, husband	3	10
and friend, Donald Draper.	3	10
Please. Please.	3	10
Please.	3	10
I'm very honored.	3	10
Sally! Bobby!	3	11
They sell it at Woolworths.	3	11
"There's a section that says ""Halloween costumes. """	3	11
You'll wear it once. Plus, it's made out of plastic and it's crap.	3	11
- I'm always gonna love Minnie Mouse. - I'm gonna be an astronaut.	3	11
Didn't you hear me?  The luggage.	3	11
- I'll go get it. - That's not the point. They don't listen.	3	11
There's more? It's a week.	3	11
We're going for a week? Are we gonna miss Halloween?	3	11
They have Halloween there. You'll go with your cousins.	3	11
Say goodbye to your father, then get the bags.	3	11
 They have a Woolworths in Philly, too.	3	11
- I only have $40. - Swing by the bank.	3	11
There should be at least $200 in your checking. That's plenty.	3	11
You have no more money?	3	11
Take care.	3	11
Roger, I think you remember...	3	11
- Annabelle. - You look wonderful.	3	11
You look exactly the same.	3	11
- This is Annabelle... What is it again? - Mathis.	3	11
I can't tell if you two know each other or not.	3	11
- Don Draper. - Hello.	3	11
Please, Mrs. Mathis, sit.	3	11
How the hell were you in town and not look me up?	3	11
I wasn't sure about coming back here. I'm running the company now.	3	11
 - You divorced what's-his-name? - No, David died,	3	11
and because of my father's will, the company went back to me.	3	11
- I'm sorry. - Fifty-one years old. Lung cancer.	3	11
That's too bad.	3	11
- So... - So, yes, if you're open to it.	3	11
Caldecott Farms, I'm sure you've heard,	3	11
had a public relations crisis followed by disastrous sales.	3	11
- I hadn't heard. - The Misfits, the movie. Clark Gable.	3	11
It was about horses being turned into dog food.	3	11
- There was an expos?. - We were singled out. I don't know why.	3	11
You don't know why? She owns a horse farm that makes dog food.	3	11
We had a 15% share of the market,	3	11
but now Benton & Bowles has dropped us for Gravy Train.	3	11
Well, that was a mistake.	3	11
People eat cow but they call it beef. Chicken is poultry.	3	11
- Pig... - We got it, sweetheart.	3	11
Well, there is no other word for horse meat. I thought maybe you could invent one.	3	11
- What do you think, Don? - I think it's a tall order.	3	11
- Do you have to use horse meat? - All dog food is horse meat.	3	11
People eat it all over the world. I've eaten it. It's delicious.	3	11
- It's like venison. - I've eaten it.	3	11
Well, I'll tell you what I'm telling the Avenue.	3	11
- Best idea gets my business. - How long do we have?	3	11
I'm in town until Friday, but only the big firms are rushing.	3	11
Well, I'm not gonna sit here and brag about how big I am.	3	11
Roger.	3	11
Bert, I have two simple rules.	3	11
I don't want to change the recipe. It's all meat.	3	11
And two, my father named it Caldecott Farms.	3	11
Don't change the name. Don't change the product.	3	11
- Got it. - Walk me out?	3	11
We had their business before, but her father was a son of a bitch.	3	11
You know, people spend more money on dog food than baby food.	3	11
I'll put the fellas on it.	3	11
- Is that really necessary? - You've never walked in high heels.	3	11
No, coming in here. What are you doing here?	3	11
I wanted to see you, and I need something new.	3	11
- I'll bet you do. - For my business.	3	11
Besides, you're married, aren't you?	3	11
- I am. - Still or again?	3	11
- You know it's again. Don't get cute. - I heard she's a teenager.	3	11
Probably too jealous to let you have a business dinner with me.	3	11
- Gonna need a reason. - Because I know you're good at this.	3	11
Advertising, I mean.	3	11
- Tomorrow night. Somewhere French. - Avec plaisir.	3	11
All the lights were on. I figured you'd be home.	3	11
I knew you were coming over. Thought it might be dark when I got home	3	11
and I didn't want the Mckays to see you turning on the lights.	3	11
That's very thoughtful.	3	11
I'm making spaghetti with cream and butter and cheese.	3	11
- And hot pepper? - Yes.	3	11
I had it like that in Little Italy. I love that place.	3	11
Believe it or not, I get treated very well there.	3	11
I wish I could take you there.	3	11
I know.	3	11
Don, I swear I'm not talking about our future.	3	11
- I entered into this with my eyes open. - I pushed you.	3	11
What does it matter?	3	11
Here we are, and I look at your life,	3	11
and even if I remove myself from the picture,	3	11
I see a man who is not happy.	3	11
I'm happy now.	3	11
What?	3	11
Okay.	3	11
Okay.	3	11
I'm going to lie down. Come get me when you want to.	3	11
Why did I decide to leave surgery? These last few months have been difficult,	3	11
but I found a reserve of strength in myself I didn't know I had,	3	11
and I realized there are other ways to heal people besides cutting them open.	3	11
What experience have you had with psychiatry?	3	11
- That's kind of personal. - Greg, remember what Steve said.	3	11
This is a field about the most intimate details in life.	3	11
More intimate than their organs?	3	11
You know, I'm curious why you won't answer the question.	3	11
What is your experience with psychiatry?	3	11
None personally, but my dad had a nervous breakdown.	3	11
- I didn't know that. - Yeah, no one was buying furniture.	3	11
My mom ran away for two weeks because he wouldn't get a Christmas tree.	3	11
A headshrinker got him through, but we weren't allowed to talk about it.	3	11
Greg, that's wonderful.	3	11
- It was a lot of things, Joanie. - No.	3	11
Answer like that. This is a talking profession.	3	11
The way you just were with me right now, so open, he's gonna love you.	3	11
The most important thing about an interview	3	11
is to express enthusiasm in a believable way.	3	11
No self-deprecating humor.	3	11
You're smart. You're funny. You're great to be around,	3	11
but you haven't decided if they're the right one.	3	11
- This isn't a beauty pageant. - Well, I've seen executives crash and burn.	3	11
I can't believe I never told you that.	3	11
I just	3	11
wanted more than I thought I would want.	3	11
But it'll pass.	3	11
Actually, I know for a fact it will.	3	11
I don't want it to pass.	3	11
One day I dropped the kids off at school and I saw you in the yard.	3	11
I kept wishing you could get in the car and drive away with me.	3	11
Just let it go.	3	11
I'll clear my schedule. We can go to Mystic or something for the rest of the week.	3	11
Mystic?	3	11
- I can think of someplace if you're serious. - I am.	3	11
Okay.	3	11
Damn it.	3	11
- Hello? - Roger, it's Joan.	3	11
- Joan Harris. - Jesus.	3	11
You're lucky I answered. Ginger's not in.	3	11
I know. She has a hair appointment the last Tuesday of every month.	3	11
- She does? - And I know that your lunch canceled.	3	11
What am I wearing?	3	11
So, how are things?	3	11
Mr. Hooker has rearranged the secretaries in the pool	3	11
- alphabetically. - By cup size?	3	11
- Well, I know where you'd be sitting. - You're making me sorry I called you.	3	11
I need a favor. I need help finding work.	3	11
- Something happen with Dr. Cut-Up? - Not at all.	3	11
He's pursuing his dream of becoming a psychiatrist,	3	11
but that means more training and I just don't want him moonlighting all the time.	3	11
- Why does it matter? - It doesn't. None of my business.	3	11
- Why don't you come back here? - Roger, I've been replaced,	3	11
and a secretary makes less money than if I was working at a department store.	3	11
I'm so glad you called me.	3	11
- I'm sorry it had to be for a favor. - No.	3	11
I like that you thought of me. You know, to ask.	3	11
You want to be on some people's minds. Some people's you don't.	3	11
- That's nice. - So, do you miss it here?	3	11
Are you asking if I miss you?	3	11
Well, I guess I am, because everything else is different.	3	11
- I should go. - Well, how do I work this?	3	11
If I think of anybody. Just give them your number?	3	11
Look at you, figuring things out for yourself.	3	11
Bye-bye, Joanie.	3	11
Look who's here.	3	11
I'm sorry I missed the funeral. My grandson was graduating.	3	11
It was beautiful.	3	11
Judy fixed lunch. We don't have to talk right away.	3	11
I don't have a lot of time.	3	11
Betty wants to know what the house is worth.	3	11
- I'm a lawyer. I'm not a real estate agent. - Well, the house was left to both of us,	3	11
and I don't understand why I shouldn't be able to buy it away from her	3	11
- at double what Dad paid for it. - They bought it in the late '20s.	3	11
Dad always said it was the top of the market.	3	11
Your father intended you to get as much money for it as you could,	3	11
if you were going to sell it.	3	11
Otherwise, somebody has to buy somebody out.	3	11
So, basically Dad gave it to Betty because he knew I didn't have any money.	3	11
This is ugly. You know that?	3	11
Milton, I need to speak to you in confidence.	3	11
I need your advice. I need complete confidentiality.	3	11
It's my husband.	3	11
I just found out some compromising facts.	3	11
He's been married before, and he...	3	11
Well, it's not even his real name, and he bought her a house, his ex-wife.	3	11
I need to know what to do.	3	11
I don't know him, Betsy. I met him at your wedding.	3	11
I know your father didn't want him in the will.	3	11
- So? - What do you want to do?	3	11
You want a divorce? In New York state, you need to prove adultery. Can you?	3	11
- Maybe. - I mean prove it in a court of law.	3	11
That's hard to do. Unless he wants out, but you're not gonna get anything.	3	11
You won't even be able to buy William out of the house.	3	11
You'll have to sell it.	3	11
And he can take the children.	3	11
That's my legal advice. You want the rest of it?	3	11
- Are you afraid of him? - No.	3	11
Is he a good provider?	3	11
He is, but that's not the point.	3	11
It's a lie so big, Milton.	3	11
I feel like I've been in some dream since I found out.	3	11
Just saying it out loud to you... This is the first time	3	11
I'm realizing it's true.	3	11
You have three small children together.	3	11
At least go home, give it a try.	3	11
That's what I'd tell my own daughter.	3	11
Damn it, Betts! This isn't right!	3	11
- Look, he waited. - This is number three.	3	11
What do you want?	3	11
I'm going to have one of those lovely wines.	3	11
Why did you have two? Are you nervous?	3	11
- She'll have one of those lovely wines. - Bordeaux.	3	11
Don wants to call in a focus group right away.	3	11
That's enough business.	3	11
I want to know everything that's happened in the last 20 years.	3	11
Longer.	3	11
It wasn't until years later that I realized	3	11
you were the only person I could remember that time with.	3	11
What do you want to remember?	3	11
What I was like at that age. Paris before the war.	3	11
Eating in cemeteries.	3	11
People were jumping out of windows and we were on vacation.	3	11
I don't remember much.	3	11
Are you trying to tell me when you saw Casablanca	3	11
- you didn't think about me? - You mean Peter Lorre?	3	11
You seemed so happy to see me, and now you're just being drunk.	3	11
Look, Annabelle. We were not in Casablanca.	3	11
The only similarity is that you left me for another man.	3	11
When she gets on the plane at the end?	3	11
That woman got on the plane with a man who was going to end World War II,	3	11
not run her father's dog food company.	3	11
You were adrift. You didn't do anything but spend money.	3	11
You walked around like you were hoping to be a character in somebody else's novel.	3	11
The boxing.	3	11
I'm not gonna sit here and listen to your reasons.	3	11
Believe it or not, I still remember them.	3	11
Jesus, where's the wine? I don't like the way you're looking at me.	3	11
- How am I looking at you? - With pity.	3	11
I finally found a beautiful, carefree girl, unconcerned about the future.	3	11
- I was more serious than you. - Well, I got mine.	3	11
I married Mona, joined the firm,	3	11
and then I got shipped off to the Pacific for the duration.	3	11
And when I came home, I went to work while you were watching Casablanca,	3	11
and I got blamed when we lost the account.	3	11
All I heard was my father said Bert Cooper had a screw loose.	3	11
Look, you're rich.	3	11
Let someone else take your horse meat and slap their label on it.	3	11
And do what?	3	11
- I don't want a whole bottle. - I'll help.	3	11
And I told him the closest we ever got to Hemingway	3	11
was sitting in a chair he once sat in. And that was the '20s, not the '30s.	3	11
And then he said he remembered me because I was the one	3	11
- who'd introduced him to peanut butter. - Yeah, I never understood that.	3	11
They had peanuts in Europe. No one ever thought of that?	3	11
- Look at us. - Will you stop?	3	11
Roger, do I look like a widow?	3	11
You look great.	3	11
You still want me.	3	11
So what?	3	11
I'm married.	3	11
Newlywed, honeymooning.	3	11
How could I have missed the window between Mona and her?	3	11
There really wasn't much of a window.	3	11
- Kind of overlapped. - I was there first.	3	11
We'll just take this and tack it onto that.	3	11
I'm gonna get you a cab.	3	11
Are you afraid I'll be disappointed? You were always good drunk.	3	11
Annabelle, let me get you a cab.	3	11
It's different with this girl.	3	11
I'm sorry.	3	11
Good night.	3	11
How'd it go?	3	11
I screwed up all my answers and I tried to talk about the articles,	3	11
but I couldn't remember anything. I made a fool out of myself.	3	11
- I am sure that's not true. - You weren't there.	3	11
Stop acting like you know everything.	3	11
- You'll have other interviews. - I don't want them.	3	11
I don't want to be a psychiatrist. It's not medicine.	3	11
I might as well work at a bank.	3	11
I don't care what you do, as long as you do something.	3	11
We need money.	3	11
I did everything I was supposed to do. Everything they told me.	3	11
College, med school.	3	11
I wanted to be a surgeon since I was that big.	3	11
I'm sorry, Greg.	3	11
- Maybe it's time to move on. - You don't know!	3	11
You don't know what it's like to want something your whole life,	3	11
and to plan for it, and to count on it and not get it! Okay?	3	11
Holy shit!	3	11
What the hell? You're insane, you know that?	3	11
Why isn't he wearing a white coat? He looks like a dog food salesman.	3	11
Dogs don't like uniforms.	3	11
Well, we're lucky. Everyone has an appetite today.	3	11
They said we should bring them hungry, but he does seem to like this.	3	11
How would you describe your dog's temperament?	3	11
She's picky, and she's nervous sometimes,	3	11
- but she's very smart. - And yours?	3	11
He's independent, you know?	3	11
He knows what he likes. He's pretty hard to fool.	3	11
- My God, they're describing themselves. - This your first group?	3	11
What if I told you your dogs were enjoying Caldecott Farms?	3	11
- What's it called? - I wouldn't like it.	3	11
- Bingo, stop. - I've never heard of it.	3	11
Well, you should. They make it out of ponies.	3	11
Goodness gracious, that's this one?	3	11
This is the first I'm hearing of this. I wish you would've told me.	3	11
- When people are protesting, I'm onboard. - Well, what brand does your dog prefer?	3	11
- Why would you do this to us? - It's inhumane.	3	11
- Bingo looks sick. - Turn it off.	3	11
- Would you prefer beef... - Could somebody get that?	3	11
- I can't turn it off. It's actually happening. - Turn off the sound.	3	11
I already know how people feel. It's your job to change that.	3	11
Any agency that does not change the name is stealing your money.	3	11
The product is good. It's high quality, dogs love it,	3	11
- but the name has been poisoned. - That name got us where we are.	3	11
- Do you think that was just luck? - I'm not saying a new name is easy to find,	3	11
and we will give you a lot of options, but it's a label on a can.	3	11
And it will be true, because it will promise the quality of the product that's inside.	3	11
Well, I'm gonna wait it out,	3	11
and not for these morons, but for another agency	3	11
- to solve my problem. - Jesus, Annabelle, let it go.	3	11
The name is done. It's unfair, but it's over.	3	11
- Annabelle! - Are you ready for the next group?	3	11
- I don't like the way you're speaking to me. - Everybody out.	3	11
- Is this about last night? - I don't even remember last night.	3	11
Well, you threw yourself at me and I turned you down.	3	11
I'm right. You want to hurt me.	3	11
No. No, I don't.	3	11
You want to know if it was a great time? It was.	3	11
Do you want to know if you broke my heart? Obviously.	3	11
Well, it was a mistake.	3	11
It's nice to hear, but it doesn't matter anymore.	3	11
It does to me.	3	11
When I was burying this man,	3	11
all I thought was, I'd have rather had my heart broken every day by you.	3	11
You were the one.	3	11
You weren't.	3	11
Well, you're lucky you found her.	3	11
Goodbye, Roger.	3	11
I think it's about four hours to Norwich, but the Norwich Inn might be a little past it,	3	11
and we can check in till midnight. We'll be fine.	3	11
I'll be right out.	3	11
Daddy?	3	11
- I'll be right back, Salamander. - Daddy!	3	11
- I left my hat in the car. - Get it later.	3	11
I need to talk to you.	3	11
- Go upstairs. - We want to say hi to Daddy.	3	11
Upstairs.	3	11
You're home early. What did William do now?	3	11
Not right now, Don.	3	11
Why didn't you just call the office?	3	11
I came home to feed the dog and change shirts.	3	11
- I have a client dinner in the city. - I need to show you something.	3	11
- What's going on? - Open this drawer.	3	11
Betts, that's my desk.	3	11
Open the drawer or I will.	3	11
Fine.	3	11
Betty, this is my desk. It's private.	3	11
Where did you get these?	3	11
You left them in the pocket of your bathrobe,	3	11
but I could have had a locksmith in here anytime I wanted.	3	11
I respected your privacy too long. Open it.	3	11
No.	3	11
You know I know what's in there.	3	11
I can explain.	3	11
You didn't have to look at my things.	3	11
Which things, Don?	3	11
The pictures covered with other people's names?	3	11
Is that you? Dick? Is that your name?	3	11
People change their names, Betts.	3	11
- You did. - I did. I took your name.	3	11
And so did this Anna woman, whoever she is.	3	11
- I can explain. - I know. I know you can.	3	11
You're a very, very gifted storyteller.	3	11
Betts, I...	3	11
I need a drink.	3	11
Are you thinking of what to say or are you just looking at that door?	3	11
I'm not going anywhere.	3	11
I'll get you a drink. Just sit down.	3	11
You bought her a house.	3	11
Where do you want me to start?	3	11
- What's your name? - Donald Draper.	3	11
- But it used to be Dick Whitman. - And who's that woman? Your other wife.	3	11
It wasn't romantic.	3	11
I ended up married to her because I ran away to join the army.	3	11
There was an accident,	3	11
and this guy was killed and I was injured.	3	11
But they made a mistake.	3	11
And all I had to do was be him and I could leave Korea.	3	11
Be who?	3	11
- Donald Draper. - You took his name?	3	11
Yes.	3	11
Isn't that against the law?	3	11
Yes.	3	11
I found out it was easier to be him	3	11
than to start over.	3	11
And it turned out he was married to that woman, so I took care of her.	3	11
And then I divorced her the minute I met you.	3	11
You divorced her on Valentine's Day, 1953,	3	11
three months before we got married. Why didn't you tell me?	3	11
- Why couldn't you tell me any of this? - When? The day we met?	3	11
On our first date? On our wedding night?	3	11
- Why did you need to know? - You don't get to ask any questions.	3	11
You have a family.	3	11
No, I don't.	3	11
All this time I thought you were some football hero who hated his father.	3	11
I knew you were poor. I knew you were ashamed of it.	3	11
And I see how you are with money. You don't understand it.	3	11
I was very poor.	3	11
Did you see her when you were in California?	3	11
I did.	3	11
And she reminded me that I loved you.	3	11
What would you do if you were me?	3	11
- Would you love you? - I was surprised that you ever loved me.	3	11
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?	3	11
- I don't know. - You obviously wanted me to know this	3	11
or you wouldn't have left your keys, you wouldn't have kept all of this in my house.	3	11
Say something.	3	11
I didn't think I had a choice.	3	11
And I don't know what the difference is.	3	11
This is our house.	3	11
- Those are our children. - Well, there's a big difference.	3	11
You lied to me every day.	3	11
I can't trust you. I don't know who you are.	3	11
Yes, you do.	3	11
We're not done.	3	11
Betts, I'm in here.	3	11
- How is he? - He kicked his blankets off.	3	11
Sit with me.	3	11
This was my father, Archibald.	3	11
But this...	3	11
That's not my mother.	3	11
My mother was a 22-year-old prostitute who died having me.	3	11
This woman,	3	11
Abigail, Archie's wife.	3	11
She raised me.	3	11
When I was 10,	3	11
Arch died and we moved.	3	11
And Abigail	3	11
took up with him.	3	11
Mack.	3	11
Uncle Mack.	3	11
He was nice to me.	3	11
What happened to them?	3	11
They're all dead.	3	11
Even Adam?	3	11
The little boy in all the pictures. I assume he's your brother.	3	11
He was my half-brother.	3	11
And he died.	3	11
He killed himself.	3	11
He came to me because he wanted help,	3	11
and I turned him away.	3	11
He didn't even want help, he just...	3	11
He just wanted to be a part of my life.	3	11
And I couldn't risk all of this.	3	11
He hung himself.	3	11
I'm sorry. I am.	3	11
Bob, how are you? Listen, I've got a favor to ask you.	3	11
I know this girl. Actually, you met her once.	3	11
Joan Holloway. Well, Harris. Redhead?	3	11
Yes, she's beautiful.	3	11
Anyway, she's expensive, but you're always complaining	3	11
about needing someone to whip your place into shape,	3	11
so think about it.	3	11
I want to help her out. She's important to me.	3	11
Jane's fine. Thanks for asking.	3	11
Don't be a stranger.	3	11
I'm sorry, Joanie.	3	11
And I'm gonna buy you another vase to put those in.	3	11
- I'm gonna buy you a lot of things. - It's not about buying things.	3	11
I know, I know, but I've been an ass,	3	11
feeling sorry for myself because I couldn't solve this problem.	3	11
And it was so easy, Joanie. The answer was right in front of me.	3	11
I joined the army, Joanie.	3	11
You're gonna be taken care of. We're gonna be taken care of.	3	11
And the best part is, I get to be a surgeon. They need them.	3	11
- You joined the army? - I know I should've asked you,	3	11
but I'll do six weeks of basic training. That's it.	3	11
I'll do my residency in New York.	3	11
- And then what? - And then I might have to go somewhere.	3	11
West Germany, maybe Vietnam, if that's still going on,	3	11
but a lot of docs don't have to go anywhere, especially if they have families.	3	11
And I'll go in as a captain. You know what that means?	3	11
You don't have to work anymore.	3	11
- I don't know what to say. - Joanie, please tell me	3	11
this will make you happy, because it will make me happy	3	11
to give you everything you want.	3	11
It's wonderful, Greg.	3	11
And no more soup. Get your coat. We're going out.	3	11
- We should. - That's my girl.	3	11
Do you want something?	3	11
Are you gonna have something?	3	11
- Daddy, are you going to trick or treat? - Yes, of course.	3	11
I'll see you tonight.	3	11
- I didn't think you were coming in today. - I canceled my plans.	3	11
Do you want me to reschedule your lunch with Jeff Stansbury at United Fruit?	3	11
No, I have plenty to do.	3	11
- Hello? - I stopped by earlier.	3	11
- No one answered. - I was running all morning.	3	11
- About last night... - What happened? Did you get caught?	3	11
It's more complicated than that.	3	11
So, I suppose I'm not going to see you anymore?	3	11
Not right now. No.	3	11
Are you okay?	3	11
Only you would ask about me right now.	3	11
Do I have to worry about my job?	3	11
No.	3	11
Okay.	3	11
I should go.	3	11
Goodbye.	3	11
Goodbye, Suzanne.	3	11
- He's home! Let's go! - You'll wake the baby.	3	11
- Do I look like a gypsy? - Yes.	3	11
Let's go, let's go!	3	11
- Do you want anything? - No.	3	11
Should I take the carriage or just carry him?	3	11
It's cold out there.	3	11
You can stay here with him or I can.	3	11
No.	3	11
Good.	3	11
What's taking so long?	3	11
- Trick or treat! - Trick or treat!	3	11
Well, hello there. Look at this.	3	11
We've got a gypsy and a hobo.	3	11
And who are you supposed to be?	3	11
Mr. Campbell.  Mr. Campbell.	3	12
I got your hot cocoa.	3	12
Wonderful.	3	12
I just got back from lunch, and Mr. Pryce wants to see you.	3	12
- It's instant. - It's from the diner.	3	12
I don't know how you can tell.	3	12
You can tell because they use water instead of milk.	3	12
It's warmer outside. It's ridiculous.	3	12
The building will take care of it. They always do.	3	12
Sorry about that. This really is hitting the spot.	3	12
Come in.	3	12
 Have a seat.	3	12
I believe I have what is rather disappointing news.	3	12
It's been decided that Mr. Cosgrove	3	12
will be made senior vice president in charge of account services,	3	12
and you will be made head of account management.	3	12
Really?	3	12
This is not to ignore that you've distinguished yourself	3	12
and been of great service to the company.	3	12
What is it based on? Our billings are neck and neck.	3	12
In fact, I think I've done a lot with what I was given in this arbitrary scheme.	3	12
It's become apparent	3	12
that you are excellent at making the clients feel their needs are being met,	3	12
but Mr. Cosgrove has the rare gift of making them feel	3	12
as if they haven't any needs.	3	12
 - I see. - I improved your title.	3	12
And you tell your clients there'll be no need to be deprecating.	3	12
- Bert and Roger know about this? - This is under my authority.	3	12
And I have to commend you on taking it as well as you have.	3	12
- I hope this was a difficult decision. - It was.	3	12
There you go.	3	12
- Where are you going? - I don't feel well.	3	12
Why did you pick that place?	3	12
I don't know why a lunch counter is any better than eating at your desk.	3	12
Well, you could've joined me for a drink.	3	12
I can drink at my desk if I want to, and I'm not out $1.25.	3	12
I'm sorry I'm not as stimulating a lunch companion as Doug.	3	12
- It's Duck, and I work most lunches. - Well, I don't like his aftershave.	3	12
I can smell it on you, and I can smell it in the bathroom in the morning.	3	12
What's wrong with him?	3	12
Nothing. I don't even know why I'm weighing in on men right now.	3	12
I think it's good that you're being picky, finally.	3	12
Well, there's nothing around but married ones.	3	12
I mean, we can't all throw caution to the wind.	3	12
But Duck's not married.	3	12
Then why are you with him?	3	12
- Well, this is me. You working late tonight? - I don't know yet.	3	12
- Okay. - Bye.	3	12
Wow. Van Cleef. How very Jane Siegel-Sterling.	3	12
- They're blue and they're new. - She's trying.	3	12
You always take her side.	3	12
I do not.	3	12
She started giving me advice.	3	12
"""Don't go to bed angry. Let them do what they want."	3	12
"""Dress sexy. """	3	12
And all I kept thinking about was Daddy. It's disgusting.	3	12
Doesn't she know that? That she ruined my life?	3	12
Your father had a part in it.	3	12
You don't think I know that?	3	12
- Brooks is different than your father. - I don't want to get married.	3	12
Everything's pointing to the fact that I shouldn't, and everybody knows.	3	12
Brooks knows. His mother knows. Do you know what she said to me?	3	12
She said in India, if the wedding doesn't take place at the appointed hour,	3	12
they burn the bride.	3	12
Just because she went to India doesn't mean she's not an idiot.	3	12
And Jane. If she's coming,	3	12
I'm not going.	3	12
She's coming, because your father's coming and he paid for everything.	3	12
You're having the wedding. The bride will not be burned.	3	12
Turn those earrings into a tea service or something.	3	12
- Aren't you listening to me? - I am,	3	12
and you're babbling like a little fool. Go to your room.	3	12
- What? - You heard me.	3	12
You want to act like a child, I'll treat you like one.	3	12
Would somebody get that?	3	12
- Hello? - Daddy?	3	12
Are you alone?	3	12
- Yes, what's wrong? - Nothing's right.	3	12
My bridesmaids are supposed to give me something blue and something new.	3	12
- Or Mommy. She should know that. - Who?	3	12
I don't like her, Daddy, and I've told you I don't want her to be there.	3	12
- Honey, put your mother on the phone. - He wants to talk to you.	3	12
You have to keep Jane under control.	3	12
Well, first of all, tell the bride that everything is copacetic.	3	12
We both agree that she's nuts and she should shut up.	3	12
Your father said that he's sorry and that Jane will stay out of your way	3	12
- and that we're both tired of the drama. - He said all that?	3	12
I'm not playing chicken anymore. If she wants to cancel the wedding,	3	12
I'll take the deposit out of her inheritance.	3	12
- He said the wedding's off. - Fine.	3	12
You mean that? You're not worried about India?	3	12
- Why are you doing this? - Do you want to cancel it or not?	3	12
No.	3	12
Then go eat something. I'm not taking that dress in again.	3	12
Why did Jane get her such an expensive gift?	3	12
I didn't even know they saw each other.	3	12
- Of course you didn't. - I forbid it.	3	12
- Can't wait to get her out of here. - Everything okay?	3	12
Goodbye.	3	12
Goodbye.	3	12
Jane! Get in here, now.	3	12
- I didn't know you were home. - I overdid it at lunch,	3	12
as did you, I heard.	3	12
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I just wanted to make amends.	3	12
I got her a beautiful present.	3	12
Why the hell are you even talking to her? You're screwing things up!	3	12
I'm tired of the awkwardness, and I'm trying to be nice.	3	12
And I don't know what kind of world you live in,	3	12
- but I am the good person here. - You're not good,	3	12
because you didn't listen to me and you really upset her.	3	12
Everything you do is for her.	3	12
I'm your wife.	3	12
And guess what? I live here and I get to do what I want to do,	3	12
so stop trying to tell me that you know better.	3	12
- You'd better not have locked that door. - Go away!	3	12
Or what? You'll commit suicide?	3	12
- Peter, what are you doing home? - I got fired.	3	12
What happened?	3	12
Lane told me Kenny is senior something of something accounts and I'm not.	3	12
I'm account something.	3	12
I couldn't even hear him. All I saw was his frog-like mouth flapping.	3	12
- So, did he ask you to leave? - No.	3	12
I have to ask this, but did you lose your temper?	3	12
No, I didn't.	3	12
That's good. That's very good.	3	12
Do you remember if he said anything about how much they want you to stay?	3	12
- No. - That's good, too. So it didn't come up.	3	12
Trudy, stop it with the Ellery Queen.	3	12
- I'm going to call Duck. - No, you're not.	3	12
They would have fired you if they wanted to fire you.	3	12
You need to wait and see how it goes.	3	12
He basically said I care too much about my clients and they notice it.	3	12
How could that be bad?	3	12
Peter, you hold all the cards.	3	12
It's going to be fine.	3	12
I thought you'd left.	3	12
- I'm here. - I see.	3	12
- Well, thank you. - I've done it before.	3	12
Go back to bed.	3	12
- Do you want anything? - No. I'll be in, in a bit.	3	12
- It's got to be 100 degrees in here. - You ask the building for heat, you get heat.	3	12
Mr. Herman on line one.	3	12
- Hello? Can you give me a minute? - No.	3	12
I'm right around the corner at the Elys?e, room 531.	3	12
- I'm in the middle of something. - Pee wee, sweetheart, it's been three weeks.	3	12
You can get room service. I think they have a Monte Cristo sandwich. You love that.	3	12
I'm having lunch with Kurt and Smitty.	3	12
They're a couple of homos. Tell them you have plans.	3	12
- It's kind of short notice. - Come on, Creative, be creative.	3	12
I have to go to the printer.	3	12
- I know a nooner when I hear one. - You're disgusting.	3	12
No, Bob did.	3	12
Bob?	3	12
I was hoping to catch you on your way to lunch.	3	12
Too late.	3	12
- I must say I'm surprised. - Frankly, I was a little suspicious...	3	12
I found out yesterday that head of accounts is going to Kenny and his haircut.	3	12
- I heard. - This is the first time he's invited her here...	3	12
- Can you turn that off? - Not really.	3	12
Did you ask him why he invited her?	3	12
He said something about not wanting her to actually have to get involved.	3	12
- Were you consulted? - After the fact.	3	12
- What does it mean? - It's not good.	3	12
I know it's not good. There's no future for me here.	3	12
- How did you do it? You made your job up. - I didn't.	3	12
I looked at other agencies and saw that they had TV departments	3	12
and wondered why we didn't.	3	12
Well, there's no such thing in the accounts field.	3	12
- There's marketing. - That's a research job.	3	12
- Is this official? - Yes.	3	12
I'm afraid we can't hire Mr. Charcot.	3	12
Well, at least you had the guts to send me a memo.	3	12
- He's far too expensive. - Salvatore Romano is gone.	3	12
There is no one in charge of the art department.	3	12
I haven't heard a complaint from any of the clients.	3	12
- Jesus! It's hotter in here than in my office. - That's because you're overexcited.	3	12
Do you want me to walk you through a delivery schedule?	3	12
This is Walter Cronkite in our newsroom,	3	12
and there has been an attempt, as perhaps you know now,	3	12
on the life of President Kennedy.	3	12
He was wounded in an automobile driving from Dallas Airport into downtown Dallas	3	12
along with Governor Connally of Texas.	3	12
They've been taken to Parkland Hospital there,	3	12
where their condition is as yet...	3	12
My God, how much have you been smoking in here?	3	12
Sorry about that.	3	12
- I'm glad you ran over. - Me too.	3	12
I don't understand. I can't run my department without an art director.	3	12
- You want to call Saint John? - Bert Cooper still has a say around here.	3	12
Hello. What?	3	12
If they wanted to fire you, they would've fired you.	3	12
I'm gonna die at this desk, unnoticed.	3	12
Do you have any idea what I've done for this company?	3	12
- What are you doing? - Christ!	3	12
- Somebody shot the president. - Turn on the TV.	3	12
What?	3	12
...top of the president's car was down.	3	12
They drew their pistols, but the damage was done.	3	12
- Oh, my God. Unbelievable. - The president was slumped over	3	12
in the backseat of the car, face down,	3	12
then Governor Connally, after slumping to the left for a moment,	3	12
lay on the floor of the rear seats.	3	12
- Oh, my God. - Dear God.	3	12
Is he dead?	3	12
What the hell is going on?	3	12
Every person listening at this moment has flashed back to that day in April, 1945,	3	12
when Franklin Delano Roosevelt...	3	12
Excuse me, Chet, here is a flash from the Associated Press, dateline Dallas.	3	12
Two priests who were with President Kennedy	3	12
say he is dead of bullet wounds.	3	12
There is no further confirmation, but this is what we have on a flash basis...	3	12
- Is he okay? - They just said he died.	3	12
Two priests in Dallas who were with President Kennedy	3	12
say he is dead of bullet wounds.	3	12
- Oh, lord. - There is no further confirmation.	3	12
This is the only word we have indicating the president may, in fact, have lost his life.	3	12
It has just moved on the Associated Press wires from Dallas.	3	12
The two priests were called to the hospital to administer the last rites...	3	12
- Oh, my goodness. ... of the Roman Catholic Church,	3	12
- and it is from them we get the word... - I know.	3	12
...that the president has died,	3	12
that the bullet wounds inflicted on him as he rode in a motorcade	3	12
through downtown Dallas have been fatal.	3	12
We would remind you there is no official confirmation of this from any source as yet.	3	12
Bill, just moments before you brought the flash,	3	12
I had word from the hospital	3	12
that the vice president, Lyndon Johnson, and his wife had just left the hospital,	3	12
been rushed away into a...	3	12
Did you give me a hickey?	3	12
- I don't think so. - I told you I don't like that.	3	12
I get questions from my mother.	3	12
Listen, there was a news story that was on right before you came in.	3	12
- It's been distracting me. - You didn't seem distracted.	3	12
- I just want to see what's going on. - What's going on?	3	12
Because it was only on October the 24th that our ambassador to the United Nations,	3	12
Adlai Stevenson, was assaulted in Dallas leaving a dinner meeting there.	3	12
From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official,	3	12
President Kennedy died at 1:00 p. m. Central Standard Time,	3	12
2:00 Eastern Standard Time...	3	12
- Jesus. - Oh, my God.	3	12
...some 38 minutes ago. - What happened?	3	12
Vice President Lyndon Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas.	3	12
- I've gotta call my kids. - We do not know	3	12
to where he has proceeded.	3	12
Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly	3	12
and become the 36th President of the United...	3	12
President Johnson is under heavy guard and was whisked away from the hospital...	3	12
It's ruined.	3	12
- President Kennedy, we are now informed... - It's all ruined.	3	12
It's gonna be ruined.	3	12
...five-year-old boy and myself	3	12
were by ourselves on the grass there on Palmer Street,	3	12
- and I asked Joe to wave to him... - Betts?	3	12
...and Joe waved and I waved, and the man...	3	12
That's all right, sir. Go ahead and tell it.	3	12
As he was waving back, he was... The shot rang out, and he slumped down...	3	12
- Where's your mother? - She's not feeling well.	3	12
He was slumping down and the second shot went off and just knocked him down.	3	12
- I can't stop crying. - No, sir, I did not see the man who did it.	3	12
All I did was look in the man's face when he was shot there...	3	12
Why are the kids watching this?	3	12
What am I supposed to do, Don? Am I supposed to keep it from them?	3	12
...that it hit him and he went all the way down in the car.	3	12
Take a pill and lie down. I can handle the kids.	3	12
...fell on him in hopes that there wasn't a maniac around.	3	12
I'm sorry, I can't help you more, but I won't forget it.	3	12
- Turn this off. I'll make us some dinner. - A Polaroid picture	3	12
taken by another witness, Mary Moorman of Dallas,	3	12
showing the president slumped over in the car.	3	12
Just as Mary started to take the picture, the president came right even with us,	3	12
- two shots... We looked at him... - You two, look at me.	3	12
Two shots rang out and he grabbed his chest.	3	12
Everything's gonna be okay.	3	12
...on his face and fell across, towards Jackie...	3	12
- We have a new president... - And she...	3	12
...and we're all gonna be sad for a little bit. ... fell over on him	3	12
"and said, ""My God, he's shot!"""	3	12
And then on Monday there's gonna be a funeral.	3	12
Are we going to the funeral?	3	12
...more shots rang out, but by that time the motorcade had sped away.	3	12
What prompted you to take the picture at that particular instance?	3	12
Well, that's the only chance I had.	3	12
For the nation and the world,	3	12
Mrs. Rockefeller and I join with all New Yorkers	3	12
and every American in extending heartfelt...	3	12
...chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba, a pro-Castro organization,	3	12
where he had been arrested on disturbance of the peace charges.	3	12
He denied he was a communist, said he was a Marxist,	3	12
and claimed there was quite a difference between the two.	3	12
Police in Dallas have just announced...	3	12
- You should get ready. It's almost 2:00. - Really, Don?	3	12
...has gunpowder traces on both hands, indicating he'd recently used a rifle,	3	12
the type of weapon that killed Mr. Kennedy yesterday.	3	12
As we told you a short time ago, Oswald has refused...	3	12
He's 24 years old.	3	12
In Washington, the body of the late president	3	12
lies in the East Room of the White House...	3	12
- Come on, Betts. ... as official Washington and members of...	3	12
Are you sure they haven't canceled it? It said in The Times they were doing that.	3	12
I'm not gonna call Roger to find out.	3	12
If we go in and it's off, we'll grab dinner or something.	3	12
...third-floor living quarters of the White House...	3	12
- I can't sit in front of the TV all day. - Fine.	3	12
...ailing Mr. Kennedy stricken by a stroke two years ago...	3	12
Just stay here until Carla comes.	3	12
...greatly, increasingly failing health for the last...	3	12
After the terrible news had reached us,	3	12
- 60,000 Berliners... - Can you see bags?	3	12
- I don't understand this. Here we are. ... gathered with torches in their hands.	3	12
Lyndon Johnson, more of the same.	3	12
Nobody voted for him. It felt for a second like everything was about to change.	3	12
You should get your coat and your scarf. I know it's far, but I really feel like walking.	3	12
Why are we going?	3	12
Because it's your boss's daughter's wedding.	3	12
It's business, Pete, and there's a system. You always say that.	3	12
It's one thing to go to this wedding and act like I don't hate them.	3	12
It's another thing to go and act like the president hasn't been murdered.	3	12
Maybe they'll cancel it, but we have to show.	3	12
...in the White House today and tomorrow.	3	12
Though it is known that they have lost their best...	3	12
- Have you been drinking? - The whole country's drinking,	3	12
and not to celebrate some spoiled brat's wedding.	3	12
We are mourning together with his widow...	3	12
- They'll never cancel. You know why? ... with his children,	3	12
- his parents, brothers and sisters. - Because they're happy.	3	12
You should've heard some of the things people said yesterday.	3	12
Like what? What did they say?	3	12
"""The man made a lot of enemies,"" things like that."	3	12
That's awful. I don't care what your politics are, this is America.	3	12
You don't just shoot the president.	3	12
Edwin Walker, who...	3	12
Chet Huntley was talking about Jackie and those kids	3	12
and how she'd just lost that baby,	3	12
and Harry Crane was looking at his paperwork,	3	12
calculating how many commercials weren't going to be aired.	3	12
...this prepared statement be handed to newsmen...	3	12
I'm not going.	3	12
You can go and say I'm sick, if you think it's that important.	3	12
"""... demonstrates the internal threat that can never be underestimated. """	3	12
No, you're right.	3	12
"""Our sympathy for the Kennedy family is no less than it is"	3	12
"""for the millions of people who have sustained equal losses"	3	12
"""in the fight for freedom. "" Then General Walker's statement went on..."	3	12
I got a call from Leona, this girl I used to work with at the phone company.	3	12
My friend Francine called me. Don couldn't get through.	3	12
Well, the system was completely overloaded.	3	12
It's annoying that people think the operators were watching TV.	3	12
They were as frustrated as anyone.	3	12
The maitre d' has reorganized the seating.	3	12
If you are at an even-numbered table, take these first six.	3	12
If you are at an odd-numbered table, the left side of the room.	3	12
Maestro, do you mind? Thank you.	3	12
Look, everybody, grab your plate and come on up to the front here.	3	12
Sit wherever you feel like,	3	12
and please feel free to have the prime rib and the fillet of sole.	3	12
Help yourself. I mean that. There are no waiters.	3	12
Three months after Roosevelt died, we bombed Hiroshima.	3	12
That's how we got over it.	3	12
I say we hang Lee Oswald, and then we take care of Texas. Hell, the whole South.	3	12
What did everyone think of the sweetbreads?	3	12
You were right, Mommy. Okay?	3	12
- Problem solved. - Hardly.	3	12
- They just told me the cake's not coming. - Shit.	3	12
Of course.	3	12
I have to say, on some level, Harry has a point.	3	12
I think he wanted attention. He obviously didn't fit in.	3	12
Congratulations.	3	12
You are so beautiful, like Natalie Wood or something.	3	12
Daddy, I really wish you could've gotten to see the ceremony.	3	12
It's okay. We understand. We're honored you're here.	3	12
- I heard the church was packed. - Those weren't our guests.	3	12
Have a seat.	3	12
Just sit anywhere.	3	12
I'm so happy for you.	3	12
I would like some legal representation,	3	12
but these police officers have not allowed me to have any.	3	12
I don't know what this is all about.	3	12
- Did you kill the president? - No, sir, I didn't.	3	12
- People keep asking me that. Sir? - Did you shoot the president?	3	12
How would you know that's what a monster looks like?	3	12
Naturally, if I work in that building, yes, sir.	3	12
Did you see The Times? He lived in Russia.	3	12
- I thought he just visited. - Would you visit?	3	12
- I'm just a patsy. - Did you shoot the president?	3	12
- There you are. What are you doing here? - They're about to interview Oswald.	3	12
Hey, somebody go buy a cake.	3	12
- Let's keep it quiet and we'll all get it! - Hold it down.	3	12
Has the gentleman been identified?	3	12
Yes, sir, he's been identified for killing the officer.	3	12
I need you out there. I'm about to give my toast.	3	12
I've heard your toast a million times. The president is dead.	3	12
And I'll tell you something else, our table has no one at it.	3	12
I consolidated the tables.	3	12
- Would you keep an eye on her? - Absolutely.	3	12
We better get back in there.	3	12
- We want to say this... - Jane.	3	12
...that this investigation has been carried on jointly by...	3	12
This toast is going to be much shorter than it was supposed to be.	3	12
Obviously, we're all in a different mood.	3	12
Can someone please get my wife out of the kitchen?	3	12
I have something very nice to say about her. But while we're alone...	3	12
I want to say something nice about my ex-wife.	3	12
Mona, you're a lioness.	3	12
And thank you for resisting the urge to eat your cub.	3	12
This could've been an awful day,	3	12
but here we are, not watching TV, but together watching the two of you.	3	12
To Margaret and Brooks Hargrove.	3	12
The adults, we all wanted to be strong for you,	3	12
but your spirit, your love, your hope is giving us strength.	3	12
And I promise you now, if you can make it through a day like today,	3	12
marriage is a cakewalk.	3	12
To many years of happiness.	3	12
- Cheers. - Cheers.	3	12
We invite the father of the bride and the bride to share the dance floor.	3	12
Sorry about that.	3	12
Now, if there are any other fathers and daughters...	3	12
You know what? Everyone, please join them.	3	12
- Do you want to dance? - I don't know.	3	12
- Want me to teach him how to dance? - He's a great dancer.	3	12
She's happy.	3	12
That's because she doesn't know his net worth just dropped by half.	3	12
Stop it, Daddy.	3	12
Hey.	3	12
Everything's gonna be fine.	3	12
How do you know that?	3	12
You'll see.	3	12
Why do you keep looking at that woman?	3	12
What are you talking about?	3	12
- Are you ready? - Did Jennifer fall in?	3	12
- She'll be right out. - See you Tuesday.	3	12
He was so handsome, and now I'll never get to vote for him.	3	12
Hey.	3	12
You want me to cut you out of that dress?	3	12
I'm making a phone call.	3	12
- Hello? - So what's new?	3	12
- It's incredible, isn't it? - Yes.	3	12
Margaret got married today.	3	12
That's right, I forgot. Poor thing.	3	12
Joanie, I wish you could've seen it. Oh, my God, what a disaster.	3	12
I'm sorry.	3	12
She pulled through. They pulled through. I pulled through.	3	12
I can't believe how quiet it is out there.	3	12
Not everywhere. Greg just called. He's working the night shift at the ER.	3	12
People are still getting sick.	3	12
Car accidents are happening. Babies are being born.	3	12
Well, I'm glad he's not home. I had to talk to you.	3	12
Nobody else is saying the right thing about this.	3	12
My God, you're really upset.	3	12
What's that about?	3	12
Because there's nothing funny about this.	3	12
Well, hang in there, red.	3	12
You too.	3	12
- Bye-bye. - Goodbye.	3	12
Put him on a standby of indeterminate length, will you?	3	12
Let me have it. I want it.	3	12
Being led out by Captain Fritz.	3	12
There is the prisoner. There is Lee Oswald.	3	12
He's been shot.	3	12
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - What happened?	3	12
Lee Oswald has been shot.	3	12
They shot him. The police were walking him through the building	3	12
- and some man ran up and shot him. - What?	3	12
Detectives have their guns drawn.	3	12
- What is going on? - Oswald has been shot.	3	12
There is no question about it. Oswald has been shot.	3	12
- Please, leave me alone. - Betts?	3	12
...here in the basement of Dallas police headquarters.	3	12
What happened?	3	12
- Do you know where he is at present? - No, sir, I don't.	3	12
- Can you give us some indication... - Nothing. Go upstairs.	3	12
The family, incidentally, asked that there be no flowers,	3	12
but there have, nevertheless, been flowers.	3	12
People either didn't hear or chose to ignore it,	3	12
and one room or two rooms in the White House have had to be set aside	3	12
to hold them. The casket, incidentally,	3	12
will remain closed at all times during all ceremonies...	3	12
I'm going out.	3	12
- Where? - For a drive.	3	12
Let me drive. I'll get the kids. We'll all go somewhere. That's a good idea.	3	12
No. I need to clear my head.	3	12
...airports, four of them around town...	3	12
- I'm so glad you could see me. - Where does your husband think you are?	3	12
I don't care. He's been lying to me for years. I couldn't be in that house.	3	12
Then I saw you yesterday. I didn't know you were going to be there.	3	12
I hoped you would be there.	3	12
Derby day, it seems like 100 years ago.	3	12
And then this morning, seeing that man shot to death...	3	12
What is going on?	3	12
It will be okay. We've lost a lot of presidents and we're still standing.	3	12
I wish I could believe you. I can't believe anything right now.	3	12
Have you thought that there are other ways to live?	3	12
Listen. I'm not in love with the tragedy of this thing.	3	12
It's not Romeo and Juliet. I want it to happen.	3	12
I have three children.	3	12
I'll know more when the primaries start to shake out in spring,	3	12
- but I can leave the campaign right now. - I don't want you to do that.	3	12
You don't have to answer me now,	3	12
but I want to marry you.	3	12
- I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything.	3	12
I told you.	3	12
But if you search your heart, you'll know that I can make you happy.	3	12
I should go.	3	12
I wish I could take you to the movies right now,	3	12
that some theater was playing your favorite movie.	3	12
Singin' in the Rain.	3	12
Well, just think about that.	3	12
This is made possible by special equipment, and it will move at one-fourth speed.	3	12
So we would like to show you the slow motion of the shooting	3	12
of Lee Harvey Oswald now.	3	12
They just stood there.	3	12
No security. The most wanted man in America.	3	12
Why even have a trial? Just throw him over to the mob.	3	12
Now you can see the two detectives, one in a light suit, one in a dark,	3	12
bringing Oswald out.	3	12
The camera changes its lens for a close-up of Oswald.	3	12
The shot has been fired. You cannot hear it in this version of the tape.	3	12
Oswald falls. The man with the hat moves in on him.	3	12
He's grabbed by the man in light.	3	12
- You're not going into work tomorrow? - No, of course not.	3	12
- It's a national day of mourning. - You're going to go in Tuesday.	3	12
There's another happy thought.	3	12
Those people don't care about you. And honestly, what's the difference?	3	12
What are you saying?	3	12
You did everything they asked you to do, but you don't owe them anything.	3	12
...minutes past 2:00 Eastern Standard Time, we were advised	3	12
that Lee Harvey Oswald was dead. Now Ruby is under arrest...	3	12
You should start gathering your clients. They'll follow you wherever you go.	3	12
...is the operator of two nightclubs in Dallas...	3	12
The only other president buried there is William Howard Taft,	3	12
though, of course, there are many other heroes of perhaps lesser renown.	3	12
That is the Lee... Robert E. Lee Mansion.	3	12
Its name, Arlington, has been given to the cemetery and, in fact, to the county.	3	12
- Francine has the kids. - The president's brother, Robert Kennedy,	3	12
and the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara...	3	12
- I don't know where to begin. - What?	3	12
I want to scream at you for ruining all of this.	3	12
But then you try to fix it and there's no point.	3	12
There's no point, Don.	3	12
You're very upset. I understand.	3	12
I know it's painful, but it's going to pass.	3	12
- I don't love you. - Betts, don't.	3	12
- You're distraught. - That's true,	3	12
but I don't love you anymore.	3	12
- I know that. - Stop it.	3	12
- I kissed you yesterday. - Kennedy's remains...	3	12
I didn't feel a thing.	3	12
...the public allowed to pass through and pay its respects.	3	12
There will be a little roped...	3	12
You'll feel better tomorrow. You'll see.	3	12
You can't even hear me right now.	3	12
You're right.	3	12
...on Monday it will be taken	3	12
to the St. Matthew's Cathedral, which is on Rhode Island Avenue in Washington,	3	12
for the funeral.	3	12
This, I think, is the largest Catholic cathedral in town.	3	12
It is, as you see, draped in black.	3	12
It's been open all day. Great numbers of people have stopped...	3	12
- Morning. - Morning, Daddy.	3	12
Good morning.	3	12
- Where are you going? - I have to go to work. I'm sorry.	3	12
- It's cold outside. - I'm fine.	3	12
Peggy.	3	12
What are you doing here?	3	12
I don't know. Aqua Net.	3	12
It doesn't shoot till after Thanksgiving.	3	12
We'll be okay.	3	12
What do you have?	3	12
- What are you doing here? - The bars are closed.	3	12
My roommate invited over half the building so they could watch TV	3	12
and write condolence letters to Jackie.	3	12
Then I went to my sister's and my mother was crying	3	12
and praying so hard.	3	12
There wasn't room for anyone else to feel anything.	3	12
The funeral's already started.	3	12
I was going to watch in Cooper's office. Is that okay?	3	12
Yes.	3	12
Are you coming?	3	12
Sorry I'm late.	3	13
That's okay. I was occupied. How are you today, Don?	3	13
I'm well, Connie.  Thank you. How are you?	3	13
I'm afraid I have some serious business to discuss. Have a seat.	3	13
I was at McCann Erickson yesterday, and they let me know	3	13
that effective January 1 they're buying Putnam, Powell & Lowe.	3	13
What?	3	13
I'm sorry, but that means I'm going to have to move	3	13
- my New York properties elsewhere. - Why?	3	13
Because P.P.L. Owns Sterling Cooper. You're all gonna be part of McCann.	3	13
- So we're all gone. - Sterling... I don't know.	3	13
 Cooper will definitely be put on an ice floe.	3	13
But you're a prize pig. You'll make more money, pick up stock.	3	13
You won't have to live and die with every account.	3	13
Bullshit. It's a sausage factory. I turned them down three years ago.	3	13
This happens all the time, Don. It's business.	3	13
I'd ask them to put you on the Caribbean hotels,	3	13
but I don't think I'm gonna stay there much longer.	3	13
- You come and go as you please. - Yes, I do.	3	13
And you don't give a crap that my future is tied up in this mess because of you?	3	13
You wanted my account, and you were lucky to get it.	3	13
And you wanted to play with me.	3	13
"Kick me around, knock me down to size while you called me ""son. """	3	13
I get it now, Connie. It's business.	3	13
You know,	3	13
 I got everything I have on my own.	3	13
It's made me immune to those who complain and cry because they can't.	3	13
I didn't take you for one of them, Don.	3	13
Are you?	3	13
- Some other time we'll try again. - Yes.	3	13
Have a nice holiday.	3	13
Sixty-nine cents a bushel.	3	13
- That's half last year. - We ain't gonna make it.	3	13
It's as fair a shake as we could get,	3	13
considering that Allotment Act made no allotment for wheat.	3	13
You were supposed to get us a good deal.	3	13
There's a surplus. What the hell's he supposed to do?	3	13
- Well, I ain't selling at that. - You've got no choice.	3	13
Sure I do. I've got a silo. Store it till winter when the price goes up.	3	13
- How you gonna pay your mortgage? - That's none of your concern.	3	13
- Settle down. We're all in this together. - No, we ain't, thanks to you.	3	13
- I take care of mine. You take care of yours. - Damn it, Whitman, this is a cooperative.	3	13
No more.	3	13
Now get out of my kitchen.	3	13
What's so urgent that you had to wake me?	3	13
Conrad Hilton told me P.P.L. Is being sold and us along with it.	3	13
- So you knew about this? - No, but it makes sense.	3	13
- All that short-term thinking. - So what do we do?	3	13
There's nothing to do. I have a contract. You have a contract. Roger has a contract.	3	13
So that's it?	3	13
You're losing your business and you don't care?	3	13
- I lost my business last year. - Well, do something about it.	3	13
If Sterling Cooper is for sale, why don't we buy it from P.P. L?	3	13
We could put everything back the way it was.	3	13
Young men love risk because they can't imagine the consequences.	3	13
And you old men love building golden tombs	3	13
and sealing the rest of us in with you. You're done. You know that, right?	3	13
So I should just throw away my fortune?	3	13
I don't have the rest of my life to earn it back.	3	13
- I understand. I'll let you get back to sleep. - Why do you care?	3	13
Because I'm sick of being batted around like a ping-pong ball.	3	13
Who the hell is in charge? A bunch of accountants trying to make $1 into $1.10?	3	13
I want to work. I want to build something of my own.	3	13
How do you not understand that? You did it yourself 40 years ago.	3	13
That's true.	3	13
But I'm not sure you have a stomach for the realities.	3	13
Try me.	3	13
Well, we're gonna need accounts.	3	13
American Tobacco, that's most of Sterling Cooper, but that's Roger.	3	13
I understand that.	3	13
Did Hilton tell you when this blessed event is supposed to take place?	3	13
New Year's Day.	3	13
- We have to talk to Roger now. - You talk to him.	3	13
Do you want to do this or not?	3	13
Honey...	3	13
Honey, he probably feels bad about the president getting shot on his watch.	3	13
Now, stop reading the paper. She's obsessed.	3	13
It's the most interest that girl's ever had in a book depository.	3	13
McCann is buying P.P.L.,	3	13
and is absorbing Sterling Cooper along with it.	3	13
- What? - Conrad Hilton told me this morning.	3	13
Christ. From one john's bed to the next. What a joke.	3	13
Don and I have been discussing the idea that we buy the company back.	3	13
- Really? Why? - Because we don't want to go to McCann.	3	13
And now you're sniffing around because I have a golden pork chop	3	13
dangling from my neck.	3	13
It's more than that. You know Bert's done for.	3	13
Now it's about Bert, huh?	3	13
I want to see what you look like with your tail between your legs.	3	13
You sold your birthright so you could marry that trollop.	3	13
Here we go. This is your pitch? Well, move along.	3	13
I'm not gonna throw it all away because he doesn't want to work at McCann.	3	13
You want to work there?	3	13
You don't value what I do any more than they do.	3	13
I was wrong. I learned that with Hilton. I can sell ideas, but I'm not an account man.	3	13
You're not good at relationships, because you don't value them.	3	13
- I value my relationship with you. - You do now.	3	13
I do.	3	13
I'm sorry. I've got points, stock.	3	13
If I'm useless, so be it.	3	13
There's a deck chair somewhere with my name on it.	3	13
You're right, Roger. If you've lost your appetite, you should retire.	3	13
Of course, I've seen that before. So have you. Men my age, even younger,	3	13
they play golf, go on vacation, lose their appetite.	3	13
In three years...	3	13
Join or die? Jesus, Bert, he was doing better.	3	13
- You know it's true. - You're still gonna outlive me.	3	13
We have to try.	3	13
So you do want to be in advertising after all.	3	13
Go upstairs.	3	13
- Daddy just got home. - I'll be up.	3	13
- Do you want me to go, too? - Please sit down.	3	13
I made an appointment with a divorce attorney,	3	13
and I suggest you do the same.	3	13
Come on, Betts. What are you doing seeing a lawyer?	3	13
I want to be civilized about this. Please don't act surprised.	3	13
You haven't been yourself.	3	13
Maybe you need to see a doctor. A good one this time.	3	13
Because I'd have to be sick to want out of this?	3	13
You've had a tough couple of weeks. We all have.	3	13
I've had a tough year.	3	13
I felt I should tell you rather than just let you get a phone call at work.	3	13
Well, forget it. I'm not gonna let you break up this family.	3	13
I didn't break up this family.	3	13
Lane, please shut the door and have a seat.	3	13
Certainly.	3	13
We know McCann Erickson bought P.P.L.,	3	13
and we know that makes Sterling Cooper chattel.	3	13
Who told you that?	3	13
Someone outside of this building who knows.	3	13
Well, they're wrong.	3	13
Lane, we've worked next to each other for a year.	3	13
Don't act like a stranger. We've got tea.	3	13
Well, I suppose you'll find out soon enough,	3	13
but your information isn't completely correct.	3	13
Only Sterling Cooper is being sold. P.P.L., well, will remain P.P.L.	3	13
That doesn't change our plans. We want to buy back the company.	3	13
We're willing to offer the purchase price plus 12%.	3	13
- It's worth more than that now. - What did you get?	3	13
I'm not going to say, but more than that.	3	13
I apologize you had to find out this way. Believe me, it wasn't my decision.	3	13
I've quite enjoyed it here.	3	13
Well, they've only got me for a year. You for what? Three?	3	13
We'll make another run at it.	3	13
The only grounds for divorce in this state are absence of a spouse,	3	13
incurable insanity, life imprisonment or adultery.	3	13
Well, he hasn't been faithful.	3	13
Do you have any witnesses or corroboration?	3	13
Not really.	3	13
It wouldn't matter anyway, with both parties at fault.	3	13
- No. We haven't... We aren't... - Ken. Ken, what are you doing?	3	13
You think the governor needs another scandal on the ticket?	3	13
I am sorry for presuming, Mrs. Draper. That was wrong.	3	13
- So what do I do? - I know it's hard to understand,	3	13
but the state of New York doesn't want anyone to get divorced.	3	13
That's why people go to Reno. It's painless.	3	13
I met my second wife. You stay there for six weeks to establish residency.	3	13
Mr. Draper doesn't even need to go, just consent.	3	13
I see.	3	13
We need to discuss what you want in terms of settlement.	3	13
- Whatever I'm entitled to. - Give us a second.	3	13
- You don't need what he can provide. - Henry, I have three children.	3	13
I'll take care of them, and I'll take care of you.	3	13
I don't want you owing him anything.	3	13
We want to get this done as soon as possible.	3	13
- Saint John, I'm glad I caught you. - What is it?	3	13
Mr. Sterling, Cooper and Draper have learned of the sale.	3	13
- What do they know? - It was a mixture of truth and half truth.	3	13
They knew about McCann, but they were under the belief	3	13
that P.P.L. Was being sold as well.	3	13
- And what did you tell them? - That they were wrong.	3	13
They even wanted to bid for Sterling Cooper.	3	13
12% above our purchase price.	3	13
Listen, I apologize, Lane. Obviously the news is getting out.	3	13
- What news? - P.P.L. Is being sold as well.	3	13
What? Why wasn't I told?	3	13
Didn't seem pertinent. Trying to keep our company calm as well as theirs.	3	13
- Well, where's my place in this? - With McCann, I suppose.	3	13
There, there, Lane. They know you're essential to the transition.	3	13
- And then what? - You'll prove yourself irreplaceable.	3	13
You always do.	3	13
Lane.	3	13
- Yes? - Don't be disheartened.	3	13
- I'll put in a good word for you. - Thank you.	3	13
No, thank you.	3	13
We've got a month till winter, then we'll be set.	3	13
This is what I showed the man from the bank today.	3	13
What are they gonna do? Sell this place?	3	13
The bank's gonna get their payday right after me.	3	13
We got nothing, and we're about to have less.	3	13
Fine! I'll sell.	3	13
I'll sell my crop for nothing. Dick.	3	13
- What are you doing? - I'll drive it to Chicago tonight.	3	13
You're drunk.	3	13
Go. He can barely stand.	3	13
Calm down.	3	13
Whoa! Here.	3	13
Calm down.	3	13
It ain't gonna rain.	3	13
Pa! Daddy! Daddy!	3	13
Your guests have arrived.	3	13
Close the door. Have a seat.	3	13
- What's he doing here? - You're gonna read us your will?	3	13
- I want the Cadillac. - I couldn't sleep.	3	13
And I thought, why don't we go to McCann directly?	3	13
- Because you can't. It's done. - You're not even gonna ask?	3	13
I did, yesterday.	3	13
And you were right. P.P.L. Is being sold, so it seems we're all going to McCann.	3	13
They cut you loose.	3	13
I want you to find out what the price was and give us a shot.	3	13
Enough. I should fire you for even trying to involve me in this conspiracy.	3	13
Go ahead. It's the only thing you did well here.	3	13
- Don, let it go. - I did a great many things here.	3	13
Have another. It's 9:30, for God's sake.	3	13
Jesus, that's right.	3	13
You have absolute authority to fire anyone.	3	13
Fire us.	3	13
Fire us. Sever our contracts. Let us go.	3	13
- Can you do that? - Why would I?	3	13
Because once this sale goes through,	3	13
you'll be thrown overboard, and you'll be a corpse knocking against their hull.	3	13
Nothing good ever came from seeking revenge.	3	13
Nonsense. We'll make you a partner.	3	13
I should think this is worth more than that.	3	13
So we're negotiating.	3	13
- We'll put your name on the door. - I don't know.	3	13
- Do you know how to do what he does? - I don't.	3	13
It could be done, but getting you, us, out of here isn't the difficult part.	3	13
- We need accounts. - Let's say we have Lucky Strike.	3	13
And although that's, let's see, $23 million in billings...	3	13
Twenty-four.	3	13
- We'd still need another third for cash flow. - Well, I can't take anyone else	3	13
or Lee Garner, Sr. Won't think that he's special. What about Hilton?	3	13
- No. - Can we get any of our other accounts?	3	13
We'll get them.	3	13
If I were to send a telex in at noon today that you've all been sacked,	3	13
it's after close of business in London.	3	13
It would remain unnoticed until Monday morning there, 2:00 a. m. Here.	3	13
That gives us today and the weekend to first gather accounts	3	13
and then a skeleton staff to service them. And of course we would have to obtain	3	13
all the materials required for continuity of service.	3	13
Obtain? We have to steal everything.	3	13
Anyone approached must be a certainty.	3	13
If news spreads, they'll lock us out.	3	13
Do we vote or something?	3	13
Well, gentlemen, I suppose you're fired.	3	13
We'll, it's official. Friday, December 13th, 1963.	3	13
Four guys shot their own legs off.	3	13
Allison, Mr. Pryce has requested an office-wide memo.	3	13
"""The office is closed this weekend. All work suspended. Carpet cleaning. """	3	13
- Can you get me Mr. Campbell? - He didn't come in today. He's sick.	3	13
Call his house. It's important. Peggy, my office.	3	13
What do I bring?	3	13
Shut the door. Sit down.	3	13
I know we have to roll out Western Union by New Year's.	3	13
- I don't have art. There's no one there. - They're selling the company.	3	13
- Again? - I'm starting a new agency.	3	13
I need you here Sunday evening to get your things	3	13
and to help us collect whatever accounts we end up taking.	3	13
- Really? - Yes.	3	13
- Who else is going? - Why do you need to know that?	3	13
- Because it's important. - I can't tell you.	3	13
Peggy, we are being bought my McCann. Do you know what that means?	3	13
You just assume I'll do whatever you say.	3	13
Just follow you like some nervous poodle.	3	13
- I'm not gonna beg you. - Beg me? You didn't even ask me.	3	13
Fine, I'm asking you.	3	13
I've had other offers, you know,	3	13
that came with a sales pitch about opportunity.	3	13
Everyone thinks you do all my work.	3	13
Even you.	3	13
I don't want to make a career out of being there so you can kick me when you fail.	3	13
- I guess I'll have to talk to Kurt and Smitty. - I guess so.	3	13
- Where the hell are my pajamas? - Will you please relax?	3	13
Trudy, I called in sick today because I had my interview with Ogilvy.	3	13
- I have to look sick. - You do.	3	13
- What a pleasant surprise. - Sorry to drop in.	3	13
- How are you? - Better than my husband.	3	13
And how are you? We've been calling all day.	3	13
- May I take your coats? - We're fine.	3	13
I'm going to change the sheets.	3	13
- Is everything okay? - McCann bought P.P.L., and us.	3	13
- What? Again? - We need to talk to you. It's serious.	3	13
We're not firing you.	3	13
Am I getting a few more adjectives added to my title?	3	13
- Don't bother. I have other plans. - Peter, may I speak to you for a moment?	3	13
Pete, we're starting a new agency. We're here to talk to you about joining us.	3	13
Wait a minute. They're letting you go?	3	13
Keep it to yourself, but I'm taking American Tobacco.	3	13
We need another 7-10 million in billings for cash flow or something.	3	13
What do you have in your saddlebag so far?	3	13
I don't have a saddlebag. I don't know what you're talking about.	3	13
Pete, I don't blame you for bailing out, the way you've been treated.	3	13
- So Kenny turned you down? - We haven't spoken to Ken yet.	3	13
And yes, we want your accounts, but we also want your talent.	3	13
Really? And what are my talents?	3	13
- You'll do what it takes. - No.	3	13
I want to hear it from him.	3	13
It's not hard for me to say, Pete. You saw this coming. We didn't.	3	13
In fact, you've been ahead on a lot of things.	3	13
Aeronautics, teenagers, the negro market...	3	13
We need you to keep us looking forward.	3	13
I do, anyway.	3	13
I want to be a partner, and I want my name in the lobby.	3	13
There's not gonna be a lobby.	3	13
North American Aviation, Secor Laxatives, Gillette, jai alai, maybe Pampers.	3	13
That's close to 8 million already. I don't think you get conditions.	3	13
We'll make you a partner if you can deliver by Sunday.	3	13
Sunday?	3	13
We'll leave the name and the title as a goal. Like it or not, that works with you.	3	13
I'd like to say I'll think about it, but I don't think that's an option, is it?	3	13
I'm not really sick.	3	13
Welcome aboard.	3	13
- Good night, Trudy. - Good night, gentlemen.	3	13
- What if I come up short? - That's not an option.	3	13
Good night.	3	13
I want you to call Hubert Adams at Secor. His number's in my Rolodex.	3	13
I threw it under the bed. Try him at home.	3	13
Tell him I'll meet him at the St. Regis at 7:30 and sound like a secretary.	3	13
I have to get dressed.	3	13
- I can't believe he was gonna leave. - That little shit.	3	13
Look, they still have a picture of Kennedy up.	3	13
Although, what are they gonna do? Take it down and put up Lyndon Johnson?	3	13
Not in this place.	3	13
I've acted like I've started a business my whole life, but I inherited it.	3	13
I need an attorney.	3	13
- Divorce. - So it's true, huh?	3	13
- What are you talking about? - Henry Francis.	3	13
- Who? - Jesus.	3	13
- Right when things were almost normal. - I need you to tell me what you know.	3	13
Margaret's friends with his daughter.	3	13
- Are they sleeping together? - I don't know.	3	13
It came from his daughter. He talks about her.	3	13
It sounds like it's serious. I was gonna tell you. No, I wasn't.	3	13
I thought you knew.	3	13
I'm sorry I told you. Believe me.	3	13
I am sorry about that.	3	13
Wake up.	3	13
- He's sleeping. - I don't care.	3	13
Who the hell is Henry Francis?	3	13
No one.	3	13
- Stop it. Stop it! - Who the hell is he?	3	13
- Why do you care? - Because you're good,	3	13
and everyone else in the world is bad.	3	13
- You're drunk. - You're so hurt.	3	13
So brave with your little white nose in the air.	3	13
- All along you've been building a life raft. - Get out.	3	13
- You never forgave me. - Forgave what?	3	13
- That I've never been enough? - You got everything you ever wanted.	3	13
Everything! And you loved it.	3	13
And now I'm not good enough for some spoiled mainline brat?	3	13
That's right!	3	13
You won't get a nickel.	3	13
And I'll take the kids. God knows they'll be better off.	3	13
I'm going to Reno,	3	13
and you're going to consent, and that's the end of this.	3	13
Don't threaten me. I know all about you.	3	13
You're a whore.	3	13
You know that?	3	13
I want you out of the house.	3	13
Hold the elevator.	3	13
- They called you in, too? - Yes, they did.	3	13
- I'll admit it. I'm a little scared. - Of what?	3	13
- Why are you here? - I don't know. Cooper called me.	3	13
First they're cleaning the carpets, now they're not. Why are you here?	3	13
Work.	3	13
Hey, everybody, Harry Crane is here.	3	13
Relax, Pete, we're expecting him.	3	13
- What's going on? - Why are you here?	3	13
I'm sorry, what's going on?	3	13
P.P.L. Has been sold to McCann. We're starting a new agency.	3	13
We'd like you to join us as our new head of media.	3	13
- Are you kidding? - Yes. Yes, we are. Happy birthday.	3	13
We need your answer.	3	13
- I should really call my wife. - Mr. Crane... Harry.	3	13
This matter is secret and time-sensitive. If you turned us down and elect to be	3	13
a mid-level cog at McCann Erickson,	3	13
we'll have to lock you in the storeroom until morning.	3	13
I'm sure you understand.	3	13
Pete.	3	13
We were hoping you could decipher these job sheets.	3	13
- Where exactly are these materials? - I never look at these.	3	13
Can't we just take everything?	3	13
That's good thinking, but we don't know where anything is.	3	13
No one knows how this works?	3	13
Let me make a phone call. I'll take care of this.	3	13
- No. No more conspirators. - I'll be discreet.	3	13
Where's Don?	3	13
What did we do?	3	13
- Nothing. - Then why are we in the living room?	3	13
We want to tell you something, because...	3	13
Well, it's going to be a little bit of a change. Your father is going to be moving out.	3	13
Now, we'll still be living here, and he'll come to visit.	3	13
- Then why is he going? - Because...	3	13
It'll just be temporary.	3	13
- Like when you lived in the hotel? - Yes.	3	13
It'll be different.	3	13
- Is it because I lost your cufflinks? - No, it has nothing to do with you.	3	13
That's not what I mean.	3	13
- I love you both. You know that. - Then why are you going?	3	13
I'm not going.	3	13
I'm just living elsewhere.	3	13
That's going. You say things and you don't mean them,	3	13
- and you can't just do that. - Sally, sweetheart.	3	13
- Go away. - Sally, stop it.	3	13
You said you'd always come home.	3	13
I will.	3	13
It's just a different home.	3	13
Will you be here for Christmas?	3	13
- You'll get to have two Christmases. - I only want one.	3	13
Did you make him leave?	3	13
No. We both decided it.	3	13
You made him sleep in Gene's room, and it's scary in there.	3	13
Listen to me, both of you.	3	13
I will be here. You can call me, and I will answer and I will be here.	3	13
- Sally. Sally. - Let her go.	3	13
Please don't go. I don't want you to.	3	13
Nobody wants to do this.	3	13
But I need you to be a big boy.	3	13
- You look awful. - Can I come in?	3	13
Do you want anything?	3	13
Yes, I do.	3	13
You were right.	3	13
I've taken you for granted and I've been hard on you,	3	13
but only because I think I see you as an extension of myself.	3	13
And you're not.	3	13
- Well, thank you for stopping by. - Please. Sit down.	3	13
Do you know why I don't want to go to McCann?	3	13
Because you can't work for anyone else.	3	13
No.	3	13
Because there are people out there who buy things, people like you and me,	3	13
and something happened.	3	13
Something terrible.	3	13
And the way that they saw themselves	3	13
is gone.	3	13
And nobody understands that.	3	13
But you do.	3	13
And that's very valuable.	3	13
Is it?	3	13
With you or without you, I'm moving on.	3	13
And I don't know if I can do it alone.	3	13
Will you help me?	3	13
What if I say no?	3	13
You'll never speak to me again.	3	13
No.	3	13
I will spend the rest of my life trying to hire you.	3	13
Mrs. Harris, what a pleasure to see you.	3	13
- What is she doing here? - I said I'd be discreet.	3	13
- Tell them what to do. - I made a list and I called some movers.	3	13
Can you read these? Do you know where this stuff is?	3	13
Yes. Of course you'll need the job bags on all these accounts.	3	13
We'll also need logo files, all the film we can find	3	13
- and negatives which aren't actually here. - There you go.	3	13
Very good. Now I can pack.	3	13
- Sorry I'm late. - Hi.	3	13
Joan. What a good idea. Well, you're here. Who did you bring?	3	13
North American Aviation, Secor, jai alai, Samsonite.	3	13
- Clearasil. - Really?	3	13
- I made it. - Where do we start?	3	13
- Well, I'd start in the art department. - It's locked.	3	13
Great.	3	13
I'll start in my office.	3	13
Joanie, I can't read your writing.	3	13
"It's perfectly clear. ""Correspondence. """	3	13
I'm tired. Peggy, can you get me some coffee?	3	13
No.	3	13
Did you wash your hands?	3	13
Hold the elevator.	3	13
Greg is gonna kill me.	3	13
I'm at the Roosevelt, but I'll need you to find me an apartment.	3	13
- Furnished? - For the time being.	3	13
I'm sorry. Good night.	3	13
Go ahead, fellows.	3	13
How long do you think it'll take us to be in a place like this again?	3	13
I never saw myself working in a place like this.	3	13
Don't bother.	3	13
We've been robbed!	3	13
He's waiting on the line. It's his third attempt.	3	13
Saint John, how are you?	3	13
What in God's name is going on over there?	3	13
I think at this point it should be very clear.	3	13
You're fired. You're fired for costing this company millions of pounds.	3	13
You're fired for insubordination! You're fired for lack of character!	3	13
Very good. Happy Christmas. Mr. Hooker.	3	13
I've been sacked. Please have my office and things put in storage at this address.	3	13
- What's happened? - You're a sharp boy. You'll figure it out.	3	13
So let's see. I have Peggy and Pete sharing the desk.	3	13
Don, we'll replace one of these couches with a table for you,	3	13
and we're adding two additional phone lines.	3	13
Media will be in the bedroom with the television.	3	13
Accounts gets the bed.	3	13
And no one is to come to this office.	3	13
If you have meetings, please take them elsewhere.	3	13
I don't want them in the lobby or the bar of this hotel.	3	13
Well, look at that.	3	13
Good morning. Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.	3	13
How may I help you?	3	13
Yes, Harry, it's room 435.	3	13
He didn't leave a note. Nothing.	3	13
Where is he?	3	13
I just heard from John Deere. Pete tried to poach them on Saturday.	3	13
He must have gone with Draper.	3	13
Damn it.	3	13
Sure. Everything's exactly the same.	3	13
Don and I will both be on the account. Thanks, Bill. Okay, bye-bye.	3	13
- Hello, everybody. - Lovely! What are you doing here?	3	13
I brought lunch. There's every kind of sandwich imaginable and a cake.	3	13
- Thank you, Trudy. - Isn't this exciting?	3	13
It is.	3	13
- This looks great, Trudy. - I know how you boys and girls can be.	3	13
- There's food. - Thank God.	3	13
Draper residence.	3	13
It's me.	3	13
I'm not sure where I'm staying right now, but I'll be working out of the Pierre.	3	13
Okay.	3	13
Listen, Betts, I want you to know I'm not gonna fight you.	3	13
Thank you.	3	13
I hope you get what you always wanted.	3	13
You will always be their father.	3	13
Okay.	3	13
Well, goodbye.	3	13
Goodbye.	3	13
Really?	3	13
You know, if you leave your shoes outside the door here, somebody polishes them.	3	13
Hello, Don.	3	13
- How was your morning? - Very productive.	3	13
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)	4	1
JACK: Who is Don Draper?	4	1
Excuse me?	4	1
Who is Don Draper?	4	1
What do men say when you ask that?	4	1
Well, they usually take a minute to think about it,	4	1
and then they do something cute.	4	1
One creative director said he was a lion tamer.	4	1
I don't want to do that.	4	1
In the third person?	4	1
I don't know.	4	1
 Knockout wife, two kids, house in Westchester.	4	1
Take the train, maybe take your car	4	1
now that you can afford it.	4	1
And who told you that?	4	1
Anything? I mean, now's your chance.	4	1
Well, as I said before, I'm from the Midwest.	4	1
We were taught that it's not polite to talk about yourself.	4	1
Obviously your Glo-Coat floor wax commercials	4	1
caused a bit of a squeal.	4	1
On the creative side, anyway.	4	1
What made you think of this idea?	4	1
I wanted it to be indistinguishable from the movies.	4	1
I wanted people to be watching it and say,	4	1
"""What's happening in the story right now? Oh! It's something else."""	4	1
 It's not an ad.	4	1
At least not for the first 30 seconds of it.	4	1
Very good, then. I think I have all I need.	4	1
It's only a few hundred words,	4	1
but on the bright side, the picture may be bigger than the article.	4	1
Oh.	4	1
You all should meet. This is Jack Hammond from Advertising Age.	4	1
Roger Sterling and Pete Campbell.	4	1
I hope we're not interrupting this crisp and engaging portrait you're painting.	4	1
(CLATTERS)	4	1
Steady there.	4	1
What happened there?	4	1
Korea.	4	1
We're grateful for your sacrifice. Peter.	4	1
Jack. Well, it's nice to meet you all.	4	1
Yeah, I'd love to bend your ear when I finish my book.	4	1
Certainly.	4	1
Don, it was a pleasure.	4	1
I look forward to the article. We all do.	4	1
My uncle lost his leg hitching a trailer.	4	1
He used to ask me to scratch his toes. He didn't have any.	4	1
We don't have time, Roger.	4	1
One quick pop, Louise.	4	1
All right. Where is this party? The Sheraton?	4	1
A wooden leg.	4	1
They're so cheap they can't even afford a whole reporter.	4	1
I'm Peter Campbell, and I'm assuming you're Jim.	4	1
Yeah. PETE: And this must be Murray.	4	1
Bob. Murray stayed in Portland.	4	1
Too bad. Missing jackhammer season.	4	1
Roger Sterling.	4	1
And you must be Donald Draper.	4	1
Don.	4	1
Bob.	4	1
We're very, very excited you had time to meet with us, Don.	4	1
Murray told us Y&R had done Glo-Coat.	4	1
Turns out everybody in New York,	4	1
except him, knows it's you.	4	1
And I think they're a little jealous.	4	1
Can't tell who the client is here.	4	1
I know a little,	4	1
but what we need to know, what Don needs to know is,	4	1
what exactly is your concern?	4	1
Well, I must say I'm getting tired of saying this today.	4	1
Next time, just have one meeting.	4	1
(BOTH LAUGH)	4	1
We at Jantzen have had a steady 25% bite of the apple.	4	1
But the two-piece is most of our concern.	4	1
You have a great bikini.	4	1
I've spent some time with the catalog,	4	1
and I would say no concerns at all.	4	1
It's not a bikini.	4	1
Bikini is underwear you wear to the beach.	4	1
We make a two-piece bathing suit.	4	1
We're a family company.	4	1
And nowadays it's tough to make a dent	4	1
if your ads don't look like a girlie magazine.	4	1
Do you want women who want bikinis to buy your two-piece,	4	1
or do you just want to make sure	4	1
women who want a two-piece don't suddenly buy a bikini?	4	1
My Lord.	4	1
That question just tied a knot in my brain.	4	1
(CHUCKLES)	4	1
Our competitors get bigger the smaller they make that swimsuit.	4	1
We don't do that.	4	1
We would like to find a way without playing in the gutter.	4	1
And that's just who our customers are.	4	1
Right now.	4	1
I love how they sit there like a couple of choirboys.	4	1
You know one of them is leaving New York with VD.	4	1
Where the hell have you been?	4	1
ROGER: What's the problem?	4	1
Don! Can you give me a minute?	4	1
I don't mind waiting.	4	1
(PHONES RINGING)	4	1
How'd it go?	4	1
Get back to work.	4	1
How was your interview?	4	1
Count to 100 and buzz me.	4	1
COOPER: You missed Jeff Atherton.	4	1
He came here expressly to see you.	4	1
I'm sorry, I didn't know he was coming,	4	1
and I don't know who that is.	4	1
You have no idea how tiny this place looks to a stranger.	4	1
Did you tell him about the second floor?	4	1
I refuse to be any part of that charade.	4	1
I wanted an office downtown. We overspent.	4	1
We could have got a lot more for our money.	4	1
And we could have had a conference table.	4	1
Atherton thought the lack of a conference table was deliberate.	4	1
He felt that a circle of chairs	4	1
demands a conversation.	4	1
About why there is no table.	4	1
(SIGHS)	4	1
They loved you. What exactly is the problem?	4	1
Well, first of all, they're prudes.	4	1
Second of all, Y&R was standing in the hallway when we left.	4	1
You've been on a cattle call before.	4	1
When the competition was fair.	4	1
Every hour of my time has to be accounted for	4	1
in the growth of this company.	4	1
Get me in a room where I have a chance.	4	1
In the end, it's going to come down to big versus small.	4	1
There's two firms in the middle,	4	1
Kenyon & Eckhardt and D'Arcy.	4	1
They'll cancel each other out.	4	1
Y&R has six floors of creative.	4	1
They can throw bodies at this account for weeks.	4	1
We don't have that kind of firepower.	4	1
We don't have to. We're the scrappy upstart.	4	1
You don't say that to the clients, do you?	4	1
(INTERCOM BUZZING)	4	1
SECRETARY: Your accountant is waiting.	4	1
Send him in.	4	1
Creatively, Y&R is not capable	4	1
of living in this neighborhood.	4	1
You know why?	4	1
Because you don't work there.	4	1
(MOCK URGENCY) John.	4	1
(MOCK URGENCY) Marsha.	4	1
John.	4	1
Marsha.	4	1
John.	4	1
Happy Thanksgiving.	4	1
Ooh! My mother's gonna be over the moon.	4	1
Enjoy it.	4	1
It's the last thing we're going to get from them.	4	1
What?	4	1
Did you kill Sugarberry?	4	1
That's a third of my work.	4	1
Stop jumping to conclusions.	4	1
I guess when Kreutzer said they were going to send us all hams,	4	1
he really meant one in a cardboard box with no note.	4	1
It's about as subtle as an atomic bomb.	4	1
Maybe they're cheap.	4	1
Do you honestly think this is a good sign?	4	1
The work was old-fashioned.	4	1
And whose fault is that?	4	1
Well, testing at four supermarkets in Queens.	4	1
How much were they spending? Nothing.	4	1
If the test was a success,	4	1
they would have gone national,	4	1
and it could be a big account.	4	1
Damn it!	4	1
I thought we were getting on a streak.	4	1
Does this mean I'm down to two days a week?	4	1
Don hated the work.	4	1
Put the ham on his desk.	4	1
He's probably having Thanksgiving dinner alone in there.	4	1
That's not nice.	4	1
(FEIGNING SHOCK) Marsha!	4	1
I'm serious.	4	1
I have a life insurance policy.	4	1
It's a company policy.	4	1
It pays the company, not the family.	4	1
What do you think?	4	1
It wouldn't be bad to have a little security for the kids.	4	1
According to this, I'm already a wealthy man.	4	1
Uncle Sam will take a healthy bite.	4	1
He already has.	4	1
And the only other issue is the house.	4	1
What about it?	4	1
Well, October 1st, she was supposed to be out.	4	1
It seemed so far away when we agreed to that.	4	1
Get her and him out of there and sell it.	4	1
I can call Ben Michaelson and have him draft a doozy.	4	1
Start World War III?	4	1
You're carrying a mortgage, plus insurance,	4	1
and taxes for a house you don't live in.	4	1
Leave it alone.	4	1
So how are your balls? Are you enjoying yourself?	4	1
Come on.	4	1
"""I don't want it like this. I want it like that."	4	1
"""Not too much of that, just a little like this."""	4	1
And then they look at it, and they don't like it.	4	1
Two of their test markets are in Jewish neighborhoods.	4	1
They're idiots.	4	1
How much does it cost for us to buy all the product?	4	1
Too much, and we'd have to do it every day.	4	1
So how much does it cost for us to get	4	1
100 women to line up at one store one afternoon,	4	1
clean them out once?	4	1
One hundred people? Do you know how big a line that is?	4	1
People would talk about it.	4	1
It's a PR stunt. We don't do that.	4	1
Why not?	4	1
Because you can't charge for it.	4	1
So what? (SIGHING)	4	1
Two women fighting over one ham,	4	1
but they have to really fight.	4	1
They have to get arrested or something.	4	1
Because it's the last ham.	4	1
We don't have to write a play.	4	1
It's Thanksgiving. They're shopping, the stakes are very high.	4	1
Old Chuck Dewey could probably get a story in the Daily News	4	1
for a case of something.	4	1
$25 per actress. We could get Gladys what's-her-name.	4	1
Who's the old lady who never takes off her mittens?	4	1
I don't have any money.	4	1
John!	4	1
Marsha!	4	1
I can use my expense account	4	1
if I say they're whores.	4	1
Top-shelf liquor, what's that gonna run?	4	1
Harry gets a case a month	4	1
for sticking his nose up some guy's ass at NBC.	4	1
Should I run it by Don?	4	1
Really?	4	1
We'll see. I'll call casting.	4	1
(DOOR OPENS)	4	1
Good. I got you when you're vulnerable.	4	1
(SNIFFS)	4	1
What do you need?	4	1
Someone white to carve our turkey.	4	1
(DON SIGHS)	4	1
I can't, Roger. I have plans.	4	1
You told me that.	4	1
Then you told me you had the kids the day after.	4	1
But you never said no to Jane's friend Bethany.	4	1
No.	4	1
I was thinking the other day	4	1
about what happens when you leave here,	4	1
and it made me very upset.	4	1
I could say the same thing.	4	1
I'll paint you the picture that's in my mind,	4	1
but if it's true, I might kill myself.	4	1
I've hardly been a monk.	4	1
Forget that she knows Jane. This girl's terrific.	4	1
She looks like Virginia Mayo, she's 25,	4	1
Mount Holyoke gymnastics team.	4	1
See her this weekend.	4	1
You hit it off, come Turkey Day, maybe you can stuff her.	4	1
(CHUCKLES)	4	1
Sweetheart, 8:00 Saturday night, Jimmy's La Grange.	4	1

Roger.	4	1
They have chicken Kiev.	4	1
The butter squirts everywhere.	4	1
Hello, Mr. Draper.	4	1
Hello, Celia.	4	1
I made you some pork chops. They're good cold, too.	4	1
I look forward to it.	4	1
But you don't eat nothing.	4	1
Have you seen my shine kit?	4	1
I put it on the top of the closet.	4	1
(CHATTER ON TV)	4	1
The children coming this weekend?	4	1
No. You need to put things back where you found them.	4	1
I didn't want to leave it in the middle of the floor.	4	1
Okay, good night. You have a good weekend.	4	1
And eat something.	4	1

(DOOR CLOSES)	4	1
(CHATTER ON TV)	4	1
So how do you know Jane?	4	1
Before you ask me all the questions,	4	1
you have to let me finish one glass.	4	1
I don't have to ask you any questions.	4	1
I think I'm actually nervous.	4	1
I haven't done this since college.	4	1
Not that it was so long ago, although it seems like it.	4	1
I borrowed a dress.	4	1
You sat down so fast I didn't get a good look.	4	1
Do you want to see it?	4	1
(GIGGLES)	4	1
I can't believe I did that.	4	1
It's hard to believe there are two girls who can wear that.	4	1
Don, I want to lift a shadow off this evening.	4	1
I know this is your first date.	4	1
First that Roger was involved in.	4	1
Oh, of course. I'm sure. It's just...	4	1
I'm breaking a lot of my rules seeing a divorced man.	4	1
But Jane has made you her personal cause.	4	1
And there are so many real problems in the world.	4	1
I know. The world is so dark right now.	4	1
The country?	4	1
My goodness, you've made me feel very serious all of a sudden.	4	1
I don't know if I can make you feel better about the world.	4	1
One of the boys killed in Mississippi,	4	1
Andrew Goodman, he was from here.	4	1
A girlfriend of mine knew him from summer camp.	4	1
Is that what it takes to change things?	4	1
What do you do?	4	1
I'm an actress.	4	1
But right now I'm a super in the opera.	4	1
And what is that?	4	1
A supernumerary.	4	1
We're the actors that fill the stage.	4	1
Like the chorus?	4	1
No singing.	4	1
I do a lot of mock drinking. I'm a wench.	4	1
I'm a courtesan. Part of a harem.	4	1
It depends on the opera.	4	1
That is truly fascinating.	4	1
I love the music, and I love backstage.	4	1
Our costumes are as good as the singers'.	4	1
And I love the stories.	4	1
They're very romantic.	4	1
Have you been?	4	1
I have.	4	1
But only for business, so I've never enjoyed it.	4	1
Well, then you must come as my guest.	4	1
They give the supers tickets	4	1
instead of paying a decent wage.	4	1
WAITER: Madam?	4	1
I don't even need to look. Chicken Kiev.	4	1
They make you wear a bib.	4	1
Come on. Let's have some fun.	4	1
Two chicken Kievs.	4	1
The Barbizon.	4	1
I bet that would make a great opera.	4	1
It would.	4	1
"Well, I guess this is ""good night."""	4	1
Okay.	4	1
Good night.	4	1
So am I gonna see you at Roger and Jane's for Thanksgiving?	4	1
It's tempting, but I have plans.	4	1
Oh, I'm sure the holidays must be very complex.	4	1
It may have been a while since you've had to pick up on messages,	4	1
but I want to see you again.	4	1
How about right now?	4	1
I stopped the meter.	4	1
We can start it again. It'll be like I just picked you up.	4	1
Will you please take a weak no?	4	1
Let's see where we are New Year's Eve.	4	1
If it's meant to be, it'll keep.	4	1
Let me walk you in.	4	1
No. I know that trick.	4	1
(SIGHING)	4	1
Waverly and 6th Avenue.	4	1
I think you both really acquitted yourselves well.	4	1
She doesn't know when to stop.	4	1
You don't know when to stop.	4	1
My objective was to get the ham.	4	1
No one told you to hit me. That wasn't part of it.	4	1
The important thing is that...	4	1
Oh. Here's Mr. Campbell.	4	1
I've been assured that you ladies can look for your names	4	1
and perhaps your picture in Monday's Daily News.	4	1
What section?	4	1
It's the Daily News. It's one big section.	4	1
All in all, not a bad way to spend a Sunday.	4	1
Can you go back to the market and get me some aspirin?	4	1
We probably shouldn't have any more contact for the time being.	4	1
(PILLS RATTLING)	4	1
Shall we?	4	1
We really appreciate your talent	4	1
and, of course, your discretion.	4	1
You hurt me. Ow! Ow! Ow!	4	1
Ladies, ladies, ladies!	4	1
Daisy!	4	1
Walk her to the train.	4	1
Are you okay, dear? Yeah.	4	1
Let's get you in a cab.	4	1
Morning.	4	1
Welcome back. How was Los Angeles?	4	1
Very hard to leave.	4	1
I would love a vacation.	4	1
It wasn't a vacation.	4	1
I had a lot of tsuris with Lucy and Desi.	4	1
Has someone been using my office?	4	1
Mr. Sterling doesn't have a television.	4	1
I'm calling a meeting for 11:00. No, make it 1:00.	4	1
Do we have a table yet?	4	1
1:30, and no.	4	1
Hi. Yes?	4	1
Do you know where the Secor rough cut is?	4	1
PEGGY: I got it!	4	1
Don't you want to know why?	4	1
I sold the Jai Alai TV special.	4	1
Really?	4	1
ABC, they're moving towards	4	1
all these eccentric sporting events, go-karts.	4	1
Well, that's very exciting.	4	1
Can you get someone to track down a cup of coffee for me?	4	1
And I'd love a grapefruit juice.	4	1
And, Joan, that is my news.	4	1
I won't even tell people after it's aired.	4	1
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	4	1
Don, can I speak with you for a minute?	4	1
Morning.	4	1
Lane, would you excuse us for a minute?	4	1
Of course.	4	1
Good morning, Don.	4	1
You know, no one who's ever been associated with an actual event	4	1
has thought it's been portrayed honestly in the newspaper.	4	1
"""Donald Draper, or Don as he is known,"	4	1
"""perhaps in an attempt to appear humble,"	4	1
"""is a handsome cipher."	4	1
"""One imagines somewhere in an attic"	4	1
"""there's a painting of him that's rapidly aging."""	4	1
For a guy from Ad Age, he can really write.	4	1
He also says you're married.	4	1
Jesus.	4	1
He never asked me that. Did he check any facts?	4	1
You didn't give him any facts.	4	1
He had to make some assumptions.	4	1
My job is to write ads,	4	1
not go around talking about who I am.	4	1
Who knows who you are?	4	1
This was supposed to be an advertisement for the firm.	4	1
Why do you have so many copies?	4	1
I bought one to read.	4	1
I was going to buy one to frame in reception, and then I read it.	4	1
I just wanted to get them all before anyone else did.	4	1
It'll be lining bird cages by Friday.	4	1
This is a missed opportunity.	4	1
You turned all the sizzle from Glo-Coat into a wet fart.	4	1
Plus, you sound like a prick.	4	1
Well, it's done.	4	1
I learned a valuable lesson.	4	1
Stay away from one-legged reporters.	4	1
Yeah, I was thinking about that.	4	1
Who is he to criticize anybody?	4	1
Just so you don't kill yourself,	4	1
there was some good news.	4	1
Jane's friend found you to be charming.	4	1
Although a little grabby in the car.	4	1
That is good news. Thank you.	4	1
She liked you. Maybe you should have fondled Peg-Leg Pete.	4	1
They raise you up and they knock you down.	4	1
I don't know what I could have done differently.	4	1
I believe that you were being modest, but he didn't.	4	1
I'm sorry, but after the year you've had,	4	1
it's just not appropriate anymore.	4	1
He's expecting us!	4	1
Is Joey coming? I'm here.	4	1
Oh.	4	1
Why can't you come to our office?	4	1
Do you want to hear what Sugarberry said or not?	4	1
Shoot.	4	1
It was uproarious. First it's Darryl,	4	1
and he tells me about how they stared at the article all day yesterday,	4	1
worrying about a lawsuit.	4	1
So I hang up and debate whether or not to tell Don, throw myself on my sword.	4	1
And then Kreutzer calls to tell me other papers picked up the story.	4	1
"And I think, ""He knows it's us,"" but how could he?"	4	1
And he said everyone, especially Darryl, was very excited.	4	1
And then he gets Christian.	4	1
He's sorry someone got hurt,	4	1
but more people will taste their ham now, and they'll love it.	4	1
(CHUCKLES)	4	1
It's beautiful.	4	1
How do you put something like this in your book?	4	1
You can't. We can't even charge them.	4	1
Well, it wouldn't be a bad idea for them	4	1
to increase their media budget.	4	1
Seize the moment.	4	1
With more crappy ads?	4	1
Hopefully not. You use it.	4	1
"""The winner of the ham battle is you."""	4	1
Can you imagine?	4	1
Lane's dentures would drop out of his head	4	1
if we came in with an additional buy.	4	1
"""Our hams are worth fighting for."""	4	1
A cartoon pilgrim and an Indian in a tug of war with the ham.	4	1
Old ladies will smile.	4	1
Why didn't you pitch that two months ago? It's good on its own.	4	1
A slogan's nothing when you have a good idea.	4	1
Black crayon. I need it in an hour.	4	1
Chop-chop, Joey.	4	1
Clara, could you get Darryl for me at Sugarberry?	4	1
Tell him it's urgent.	4	1
I may need you.	4	1
(INTERCOM BUZZES)	4	1
SECRETARY: Horace Cook, Jr. It's urgent.	4	1
Ho-Ho. How was Tijuana?	4	1
I have to say, it's a very flattering picture.	4	1
And I don't think I'd mind being described that way.	4	1
Mr. Crane, you're a salesman.	4	1
You do not want to be known as mysterious.	4	1
There'll be no further discussion.	4	1
I just got off the phone with Ho-Ho. Jai Alai is leaving.	4	1
What? It's over.	4	1
Bullshit. I just sold a TV special to ABC.	4	1
Well, apparently Don didn't mention them in the article.	4	1
I didn't mention anyone. That's the reporter's job.	4	1
Spectacular.	4	1
What the hell's Ho-Ho doing reading Ad Age?	4	1
Fix it.	4	1
Todd got all the partners from CGC to call,	4	1
and they worked them up and down.	4	1
They told him we laugh about him.	4	1
I don't!	4	1
Get him on the phone, get him in here	4	1
or camp out in his driveway.	4	1
He hung up on me.	4	1
I think he was crying.	4	1
How much was left in Ho-Ho anyway?	4	1
We'll survive with Jai Alai off our list.	4	1
We will survive, but for how long?	4	1
The loss of Jai Alai	4	1
makes Lucky Strike 71% of our billings.	4	1
It's an untenably insecure position.	4	1
Harry, why don't you call and pretend like you don't know any of this.	4	1
Give it an hour so he'll take the call.	4	1
I wish we really had a second floor	4	1
so I could jump off it.	4	1
I'm going to have to get you another interview.	4	1
The Wall Street Journal.	4	1
And what do I do differently?	4	1
I told him the truth.	4	1
Who gives a crap what I say anyway?	4	1
My work speaks for me.	4	1
Turning creative success into business is your work.	4	1
And you've failed.	4	1
It'll pass.	4	1

Oh, Grandma Pauline, I told you Mother's was at noon. We already ate.	4	1
Well, you're supposed to overeat on Thanksgiving.	4	1
Thank you.	4	1
Jamie, you'll have something?	4	1
We missed dessert.	4	1
You're next to your father.	4	1
Put up some coffee, dear.	4	1
Hi, Daddy.	4	1
Isn't that sweet?	4	1
We didn't forget you.	4	1
What do you say?	4	1
Thank you. Thanks.	4	1
After you eat.	4	1
The traffic was simply murder.	4	1
That's because that's what's become of this country.	4	1
Everyone has two Thanksgivings to go to.	4	1
Maybe we have twice as much to be thankful for.	4	1
Don't you like the food, dear?	4	1
No.	4	1
Sally Draper, that's rude.	4	1

to get in a fight over a Sugarberry ham.	4	1

I'm here.	4	1
Well, one of them pressed charges	4	1
against the other for assault.	4	1
It's $80 bail and $100 apiece to keep their mouths shut.	4	1
And it has to happen today.	4	1
Call Pete!	4	1
Do you think you're my first call?	4	1
Hello. I'm so sorry to bother you.	4	1
I ought to let you twist in the wind.	4	1
It still worked out.	4	1
You'll be very happy.	4	1
I'm not happy.	4	1
And I don't think it's funny or cute.	4	1
You run something like that by me first.	4	1
I would have kept you from looking like an idiot,	4	1
or worse yet, making me look like one. Is that what you want?	4	1
You want people to think we're idiots, Peggy?	4	1
Hey, there's no reason for name-calling.	4	1
She's been agonizing.	4	1
Who are you?	4	1
I'm her fiance.	4	1

Why'd you bring him up here if you didn't want him involved?	4	1
I know. I'm sorry, Don.	4	1

We haven't found the right place for the kids.	4	1

It was going great until it wasn't.	4	1
Thanks for the ham.	4	1
I should have told you.	4	1
Since when do you have a fiance?	4	1
I don't.	4	1
But you didn't have to do that that way.	4	1
You brought him with you because you thought I wouldn't embarrass you.	4	1
At least I'm thinking ahead.	4	1
Doesn't always work, does it?	4	1
You need to think a little bit more	4	1
about the image of this agency.	4	1
Well, nobody knows about the ham stunt,	4	1
so our image remains pretty much where you left it.	4	1
I won't need you in the Jantzen presentation.	4	1
Now you're being spiteful.	4	1
No, I just think it would be better	4	1
not to have a girl in the room.	4	1
You know something?	4	1
We are all here because of you.	4	1
All we want to do is please you.	4	1
Why don't I put them in the pantry?	4	1
Christmas is around the corner.	4	1
PAULINE: Put them in the basement.	4	1
Did the children like their gifts?	4	1
They did.	4	1
It's nice the holiday is memorable in some other way.	4	1
I'm sorry a little girl spoiled your Thanksgiving.	4	1
Next time I'll tell her not to get sick.	4	1
I've raised children in my life, Henry.	4	1
They're terrified of her.	4	1
You don't know any of the people you're talking about.	4	1
Well, I know what you see in her.	4	1
And you could have gotten it without marrying.	4	1
Why can't you give her a chance?	4	1
She loves you.	4	1
She's a silly woman.	4	1
Honestly, Henry.	4	1
I don't know how you can stand living in that man's dirt.	4	1
DON: You go to the swimming pool, you go to the beach,	4	1
take off your robe, you head into the cabana.	4	1
There's no other way to slice it,	4	1
you're getting undressed.	4	1
Can I put my feet on this?	4	1
Pretend like it's your living room.	4	1
Thank you.	4	1
What separates a bathing suit from underwear?	4	1
The cut and the print of the cloth	4	1
and some sort of gentlemen's agreement.	4	1
"""So well built, we can't show you the second floor."""	4	1
I think that's a little suggestive.	4	1
Good. That's what I was going for.	4	1
A wink, but it's not a leer.	4	1
We don't want a wink.	4	1
I think I explained our product is for modest people.	4	1
Modest people want to be stimulated, too.	4	1
This draws them in in a way	4	1
that will make your competitors seem crude and obvious.	4	1
Plus, they'll be dying to see the suit.	4	1
They'll be dying to see the girl.	4	1
And for all we know, she's not even wearing a top.	4	1
You'll get them into the store.	4	1
Isn't that the point?	4	1
It's not wholesome. It's not...	4	1
Did I tell you we're a family company?	4	1
I think I know what you're looking for.	4	1
A couple of women bouncing a beach ball,	4	1
little girl in front of them building a sandcastle.	4	1
Your competitors are gonna keep killing you	4	1
because you're too scared of the skin	4	1
that your two-piece was designed to show off.	4	1
Well, it's somehow dirtier not seeing anything.	4	1
You need to decide what kind of company you want to be.	4	1
Comfortable and dead, or risky and possibly rich.	4	1
All I know is we don't want that.	4	1
Well, gentlemen, you were wondering	4	1
what a creative agency looks like,	4	1
there you have it.	4	1
Hope you enjoyed looking in the window.	4	1
Give me a minute.	4	1
ROGER: Where are you going?	4	1
Control yourself. Cool off.	4	1
And hopefully Campbell can talk them	4	1
into hearing a few more ideas in a week or so.	4	1
What? No. That's not the point.	4	1
Out. Get out.	4	1
Don. Excuse me?	4	1
Get your things and get out of my office now.	4	1
Come on. Let's go. (SNAPPING FINGERS)	4	1
Call Bert Cooper's man at The Wall Street Journal.	4	1
(DON SLAMS DOOR)	4	1
There's always a name in every partnership	4	1
that defines who they are.	4	1
In the case of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,	4	1
would you say that's Donald Draper?	4	1
Yes.	4	1
Really?	4	1
Last year, our agency was being swallowed whole.	4	1
I realized I had two choices.	4	1
I could die of boredom or holster up my guns.	4	1
So I walked into Lane Pryce's office and I said,	4	1
"""Fire us."""	4	1
Two days later, we were operating out of the Pierre Hotel.	4	1
Within a year,	4	1
we had taken over two floors of the Time-Life Building.	4	1
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)	4	1
I'm worried that's gonna hit the ceiling.	4	2
We always get a tall one.	4	2
Not taller than the living room.	4	2
Let's go back to the other one	4	2
And stand next to it.	4	2
Hey, Sally. Sally.	4	2
Hello.	4	2
- It's Glen. - I know that.	4	2
Well, you all just walked right by me when you came in.	4	2
Sorry.	4	2
What are you doing back here?	4	2
 My mom got married and now I'm supposed to live with him.	4	2
I saw your new dad. My mom said that would happen.	4	2
After they're married awhile, they'll have a baby.	4	2
You should probably ask for something big now.	4	2
Hi. Are you getting a tree?	4	2
No, I'm working.	4	2
- What do you do? - I bring twine over.	4	2
I get to cut it.	4	2
- Wow. - Yeah, I made it.	4	2
Those are good colors.	4	2
We're leaving as soon as I find you.	4	2
- Bye, Glen. - Maybe I'll call you.	4	2
- Good time, bad time? - Yes.	4	2
You've got a resume	4	2
 From the girl you met at the Ziegfeld theater.	4	2
- File it. - Al Weaver at Johnson wax	4	2
Requested another print of glo-coat.	4	2
And you got this very important piece of mail.	4	2
Open it.	4	2
dear daddy, Bobby thinks this is going to the north pole	4	2
But we should keep up the roos.	4	2
- R-double-o-s. - Too much television.	4	2
Bobby says he knows that he doesn't deserve	4	2
A heath Kit radio because of what happened	4	2
With leaving the freezer open in the garage	4	2
But maybe Santa could choose from a bicycle, a better pellet gun,	4	2
A clock radio, a transistor radio,	4	2
A drum set and a bicycle.	4	2
I left that freezer open.	4	2
baby gene wants a fireman.	4	2
I don't know what that means.	4	2
Adorable.	4	2
and I would like the gold necklace	4	2
That you can put your initials on that we saw at Macy's.	4	2
And most of all, I'd like you to be here on Christmas morning	4	2
To give it to me, but I know you can't be.	4	2
I'm sorry.	4	2
So a drum set, a fire truck...	4	2
The necklace is $30.	4	2
It's s. B.D.... Sally Beth draper.	4	2
And...	4	2
Get her some Beatles 45s	4	2
And him a transistor radio too.	4	2
Um, the girls went to Joan	4	2
And I don't want to undermine her,	4	2
But are we allowed to bring a friend to the Christmas party?	4	2
Lane scaled it back	4	2
To a glass of gin and a box of Velveeta.	4	2
We're tightening our belts.	4	2
But you will be getting a bonus,	4	2
Even if I have to see to it myself.	4	2
Well, thank you.	4	2
I didn't want to have to write a letter to Santa.	4	2
- Do you want this? - Sure.	4	2
Send him in.	4	2
Ready Freddy.	4	2
It's been too long.	4	2
Nah, just long enough.	4	2
You look good. Have a seat.	4	2
Jeez.	4	2
It looks like an Italian hospital in here.	4	2
I know, I know. Jane got a decorator.	4	2
I feel like with my hair you can't even see me in here.	4	2
- Something brown? - Maybe later.	4	2
What time is it? Oh, look at that.	4	2
So I thought it'd be best if I broached this opportunity in person.	4	2
Well, don't be fooled by the setup here.	4	2
It's Potemkinville.	4	2
Well, maybe I can help.	4	2
I walked out of j.W.T.	4	2
With a present under my arm... pond's cold cream.	4	2
It's $2 million, but they'll never even notice it's gone.	4	2
How the hell did you do that?	4	2
Suffice it to say	4	2
The client and I are in a fraternity together.	4	2
I can't handle the account myself,	4	2
But I'm clean and sober now...	4	2
16 months without a drop.	4	2
- So when you said maybe later? - What am I gonna say?	4	2
Look, if it doesn't work out, you can keep the account.	4	2
What am I gonna say?	4	2
Yes.	4	2
There is one little caveat.	4	2
Name it.	4	2
I feel like I'm getting sucked into that thing.	4	2
I don't want Pete Campbell near this.	4	2
I was surprised you took him along.	4	2
No comment.	4	2
Sugarberry has been selling hams for 30 years at a fairly steady rate	4	2
While doing in everything they could to create sales,	4	2
And then we do this in a month.	4	2
We have to give them time to reconcile that.	4	2
- Freddy! - Ballerina.	4	2
I feel like the tin man.	4	2
Good to see you.	4	2
How are you, Freddy?	4	2
Couldn't be better.	4	2
I was just talking about you.	4	2
Freddy here just ran in from the yard	4	2
With a $2-million account in his mouth.	4	2
- Pond's cold cream. - Well, that explains why you look so good.	4	2
A little early for that, isn't it, don?	4	2
Very funny.	4	2
The pedigree of this account is that it was boosted.	4	2
And I'll need to maintain my personal contact to it creatively.	4	2
If that's all right with you, don.	4	2
If you don't mind working with this old thing over here.	4	2
I was counting on it.	4	2
- Oh, none for me. - Oh.	4	2
- When can you bring 'em in? - I'll be handling this one, Pete.	4	2
Well, Freddy, I hate to bring this up,	4	2
But I do believe it's on everyone's mind.	4	2
We all want to know if you can be Santa at the Christmas party.	4	2
It's the role I was born to play.	4	2
Francis residence.	4	2
Can Sally come to the phone?	4	2
Who may I say is calling?	4	2
Stanley. I have a question about homework.	4	2
Sally, there's a young man on the phone... Stanley.	4	2
- Hello? - It's Glen.	4	2
Oh, hi.	4	2
Don't you wanna know why I said my name is Stanley?	4	2
I guess.	4	2
Because this is private.	4	2
- Where are you? - Where do you think?	4	2
I'm down the street at my mom's.	4	2
How come you didn't move?	4	2
I don't know.	4	2
I hate it here. I really really do.	4	2
Why?	4	2
I won't tell anybody.	4	2
Every time I go around a corner,	4	2
I keep thinking I'll see my dad.	4	2
Sorry.	4	2
- They're not gonna get back together, you know. - Glen?	4	2
Especially now that she's doing it with somebody else.	4	2
- Doing what? Glen!	4	2
Well, don't worry.	4	2
One day they'll wake up and they'll want to move.	4	2
You'll see. I've gotta go. Bye.	4	2
Goodbye.	4	2
- Who's Stanley? - A boy.	4	2
We will soon be charging clients for this service	4	2
And Dr. Atherton will in turn be charging us.	4	2
Significantly less.	4	2
Bert and I have been meaning to work together for years.	4	2
Out in the open at least.	4	2
Very good then. Shall we dim the lights?	4	2
No, beginning the presentation with the film is a mistake.	4	2
Audiences will listen to anything in anticipation.	4	2
See what I was talking about?	4	2
Simply said, we believe that at the motivational research group,	4	2
We have brought the science of consumer evaluation	4	2
To a point of precision like that of a surgeon's scalpel.	4	2
No doubt, with the help of minds like Dr. Faye Miller,	4	2
With whose work you are already unknowingly familiar.	4	2
Faye helped develop the indelible image	4	2
That has become the standard of feminine hygiene advertising...	4	2
The carefree gal in white pants.	4	2
It's right up there with the polio vaccine.	4	2
Beyond demographic information...	4	2
Salary, age, marital situation...	4	2
We've tried to find a way to select prospects	4	2
Who can really provide insight.	4	2
This test is our beginning.	4	2
Take a minute, fill it out	4	2
And please take a cookie.	4	2
What's it mean if we don't?	4	2
That you're a psychopath.	4	2
The point of this exercise is	4	2
To familiarize you with our methods.	4	2
The point of the cookies is that everyone should be rewarded for their time.	4	2
These questions have been designed	4	2
To get at what subjects really want	4	2
Instead of what they say they do.	4	2
What are the real feelings that exist below the surface?	4	2
For example, how would you describe your father?	4	2
No matter what the answer,	4	2
It creates a level of intimacy for the next question,	4	2
who makes decisions in your household?	4	2
There's some pencils if you need them.	4	2
I apologize. I have an appointment.	4	2
That is yours to keep.	4	2
- Is that work? - No, it's me. It's kind of silly.	4	2
Tell me when they pull the curtains so I can get out of here.	4	2
- Do you want ice? - Yes.	4	2
- What are you doing? - Oh.	4	2
Saint Vincent's junior staff Christmas party.	4	2
- At 8:00 in the morning? - Well, the shift just ended and we have to do it soon,	4	2
Because Christmas and new year's we're overrun with suicides.	4	2
- Well, uh... - Phoebe.	4	2
And you're don. I know.	4	2
- I hope we haven't met. - Well, I'm right across the hall.	4	2
We wave to each other.	4	2
You met my friend Sarah. She fell on the stairs.	4	2
Maybe you weren't in uniform.	4	2
Don't pretend that you've never noticed me.	4	2
You always grunt when you put your keys in the door.	4	2
It's not good, which is why I am inviting you to my party.	4	2
I really appreciate the invitation, Phoebe,	4	2
But I'm late for work.	4	2
So you should thank me for waking you.	4	2
Tallulah Bankhead, she's glamorous.	4	2
She seems more uncompromising than a movie star,	4	2
You know, because she's on Broadway.	4	2
She never got off Broadway because she's not beautiful enough.	4	2
Shame on you. Come on.	4	2
A little backstage at the makeup mirror with pond's.	4	2
A big bouquet of roses, opening night.	4	2
the choice of professionals.	4	2
It's good, right?	4	2
All of their research says that they're trying to get young women.	4	2
Well, young women look up to older women.	4	2
For beauty tips? Are you joking?	4	2
I know the client. This thing is rigged.	4	2
- That's what he wants. - It's not just about the client.	4	2
People are looking at everything we do here.	4	2
Have you seen our work? It's very different than this.	4	2
- Frederick van Rumsen! - Von.	4	2
Boy oh boy, were you missed at lunch.	4	2
Cal Rutledge from pond's. What a cut-up.	4	2
- What do you mean? - I mean I've got to go lay down.	4	2
- I can't believe that's his job.	4	2
Hello. Can you tell him Mr. Rumsen's on the phone?	4	2
- Interrupt him. - What's wrong?	4	2
Calvin, do you have anything to tell me?	4	2
Uh-huh.	4	2
Did you just have lunch with Roger sterling?	4	2
So you have nothing to say?	4	2
Hey hey, don't do that.	4	2
It's okay.	4	2
Pull yourself together.	4	2
First baptist church, 79th and Broadway.	4	2
- I've gotta go. - Is everything okay?	4	2
What, you can't put two and two together?	4	2
Listen, cutie, wrap your head around	4	2
Finding the right famous face	4	2
Or my other thing about the t zone.	4	2
I want 10 tags apiece,	4	2
Then I narrow it down and then we go to don.	4	2
Are you serious?	4	2
I'll do 'em too. Don't worry.	4	2
I'm sure yours'll be better because you're girlier.	4	2
Lee garner Jr.	4	2
Put him through.	4	2
- Caroline, did he say what it was about?	4	2
Well, hello, Lee. How's palm beach?	4	2
Beautiful. Heading back there in a couple of days.	4	2
Back? Where the hell are you?	4	2
In town doing a little Christmas shopping.	4	2
Yeah, I'd love to see you now that I know you're in town.	4	2
Caroline!	4	2
- How about dinner tomorrow? - Christmas party.	4	2
How about lunch? We're having a Christmas party.	4	2
Why am I getting my invitation so late?	4	2
Because I thought you were out of town.	4	2
Huh. Madison Avenue office Christmas party?	4	2
I've seen the movies. You find me.	4	2
Okay. 3:00?	4	2
- No, 4:00. - 5:00.	4	2
Shit. Go get Lee.	4	2
I'm looking forward to it.	4	2
You won't be disappointed.	4	2
Oh.	4	2
I just got off the phone with Lee garner Jr.	4	2
He's going to stop by. We're going to have to have a Christmas party,	4	2
- A real one. - How did that happen?	4	2
It happened. In fact, he was offended	4	2
That we hadn't invited him already.	4	2
Uninvite him.	4	2
Take him to the four seasons. He can have three entries.	4	2
This man doesn't care about food.	4	2
I know that you've lived your life from a bottomless pocket,	4	2
But there's a very real system of money coming in versus money going out.	4	2
Overtime, supplies being used carelessly,	4	2
Leaving the lights on, parties... it adds up.	4	2
Listen, Olivier, aren't you the one who's always talking about	4	2
How lucky strike is 99% of our business or something?	4	2
69% if we land pond's cold cream.	4	2
We have pond's and I hate the way you say percent,	4	2
- Do you know that? - What about our other clients?	4	2
We have no other clients.	4	2
If Lee garner Jr. Wants three wise men flown in from Jerusalem,	4	2
He gets it. Caroline!	4	2
Get Joanie in here. You want something? I brought it from home.	4	2
- Yes? - There's been a small adjustment	4	2
To the scale of our Christmas party.	4	2
- Lower or higher? - Lee garner Jr. Will be joining us.	4	2
I trust you will make the appropriate improvements.	4	2
Well, I don't. We need to change its rating	4	2
From convalescent home to Roman orgy.	4	2
Maalox.	4	2
I want a bartender and a tree.	4	2
Screw him. I love Christmas.	4	2
You love Christmas parties.	4	2
We're going to need more employees,	4	2
So I'm going to allow everyone escorts, even the girls.	4	2
New York food... deli and Chinese...	4	2
And some kind of gift for Mr. Garner.	4	2
You're off-limits.	4	2
I don't think he's the one who needs to be reminded.	4	2
Oh, come on.	4	2
He was all over you the time you wore that red dress...	4	2
The one with the bow in the back that makes you look like a present.	4	2
- You have an incredible memory. - Yeah, I think about it a lot...	4	2
That dress, I mean.	4	2
- Could you wear it? - Stop it.	4	2
I didn't mean it that way.	4	2
All I was saying was this is the office and that's life.	4	2
This is good	4	2
And that's life.	4	2
What a nice surprise.	4	2
Sheila at the station baked them.	4	2
Sheila. Who's Sheila?	4	2
Huh. She's 60 years old.	4	2
You see how shaky the icing is?	4	2
Hey, knock it off.	4	2
Why? Is Rasputin home?	4	2
Shh. She'll hear you.	4	2
I want to lie down. I'm tired.	4	2
Uh-huh. My bed is covered with work.	4	2
- That's kind of symbolic. - How is my face?	4	2
Fresh, dewy, well cared for?	4	2
Let me get a better look.	4	2
You taste like soap.	4	2
I'm in the middle of a seven-day beauty plan.	4	2
Can't we just	4	2
Get undressed and lie together again?	4	2
That was a bad idea.	4	2
How long is this gonna go on?	4	2
Oh, I'm sorry you feel you've put in the time.	4	2
- We're not doing anything. - We're doing some things.	4	2
We're not doing anything I can't do myself.	4	2
Mark.	4	2
I told you I want you.	4	2
In fact I want you so much I wanna wait.	4	2
And I told you there's nothing to be afraid of.	4	2
I want to be your first.	4	2
You're so old-fashioned.	4	2
No, I'm not.	4	2
In Sweden, they make love	4	2
The minute they feel attracted.	4	2
And it's healthier, because you can find,	4	2
You know, the perfect person.	4	2
Because making love is a very important part of a life with someone.	4	2
The most important. In Sweden, anyway.	4	2
Where did you hear that?	4	2
I read this article, the Swedish way of love.	4	2
It's very enlightened.	4	2
You're never going to get me to do anything Swedish people do.	4	2
All you have to do is take a couple of steps that way.	4	2
- I brought you cookies. - Huh.	4	2
I think you should go home.	4	2
And I want you to think about that.	4	2
Sorry. Everybody leaves	4	2
The moment you have to clean up.	4	2
I might have a vacuum.	4	2
Where the hell are you coming from?	4	2
- Work. - Where do you work?	4	2
The white horse tavern?	4	2
Did you have a party or something?	4	2
- I hate parties. - And you hate Christmas.	4	2
- I got it. - I don't hate Christmas.	4	2
I hate this Christmas.	4	2
Of course you have heat.	4	2
Can I get you something?	4	2
Come on. You're going to bed.	4	2
Look where we are.	4	2
- You're good with that. - My father was a drunk.	4	2
If you don't behave yourself,	4	2
I'm not gonna take your shoes off	4	2
And you're gonna wake up with sores on your heels.	4	2
How can you stand going to a hospital every day?	4	2
I love working at the hospital...	4	2
People coming into the world,	4	2
People leaving it.	4	2
Everything happens there.	4	2
Good night, don.	4	2
Good night!	4	2
Against the wall, please. Megan.	4	2
The bar looks good. I need you to get	4	2
The chafing dishes and the sternos.	4	2
Then call Peking house and move the delivery from 4:00 to 3:30.	4	2
- They're always late. - Yes, Joan.	4	2
That one.	4	2
On the short list I've got Tallulah, Jessica Tandy,	4	2
Barbara Stanwyck and Doris day.	4	2
- Different types. - I don't even understand your list.	4	2
What's wrong with Elizabeth Taylor?	4	2
Isn't it about making old ladies look good?	4	2
Nothing makes old ladies look good.	4	2
But pond's does. That's the point.	4	2
If young girls started using it,	4	2
Maybe they'd find a husband and they wouldn't be so angry.	4	2
All I was trying to say is that I've used the stuff	4	2
And I think there's something about the experience	4	2
Of putting it on and looking in the mirror.	4	2
If we were to go another way, that's not a bad idea.	4	2
Indulging yourself, right?	4	2
No, if you use pond's, you'll get married.	4	2
That's not what I was saying.	4	2
Or we could go the other way.	4	2
If you don't use it, then you'll never get married.	4	2
Which is better?	4	2
You know what? Just write 'em down.	4	2
No, I'm not writing that down.	4	2
I'm sorry if I hit a nerve there, precious.	4	2
You know, Freddy, I have brought your name up 100 times	4	2
In the last year to come in and freelance, for me,	4	2
But everybody is right about you.	4	2
You and your grand dames, your portable typewriter	4	2
And your desperate spinsters...	4	2
You're old-fashioned. You know that?	4	2
- Miss Olson? - Yes?	4	2
Everybody's leaving to get dressed for the party.	4	2
- Do you need me right now? - No, you can go.	4	2
I... I'm...	4	2
I'm sorry, Freddy.	4	2
Don't worry about it.	4	2
Is Violet coming?	4	2
She wouldn't miss it.	4	2
- Oh, thank you, dear. You know Peter.	4	2
He'd rather spend every waking second right here in the city.	4	2
Who'd want to miss Christmas in New York? 5th Avenue...	4	2
Chestnuts roasting on a greasy man's open street cart.	4	2
My goodness.	4	2
We're going to the Bahamas and there's nothing else to it.	4	2
Harry spent so much time in Los Angeles,	4	2
- I figured I'd treat him to the mountains. - Stowe.	4	2
What about you, don? Do you have any plans?	4	2
Yes, heading to Acapulco.	4	2
- Are you taking anyone special? - No.	4	2
- Well, it's your own fault. - Yes, I pity him,	4	2
Marooned in that sea of bikinis.	4	2
- merry Christmas.	4	2
- Nice to see you again. - And you as well, sir.	4	2
- Don. - Okay. Don.	4	2
We're going to get something to drink.	4	2
Where the hell is he?	4	2
They are children,	4	2
And they can't accept the fact	4	2
That others have to make decisions for them.	4	2
So we are not part of this herd you're talking about.	4	2
You're from Great Britain.	4	2
I'd think you'd be familiar with the perils of socialism.	4	2
Civil rights is the beginning	4	2
Of a slippery slope.	4	2
If they pass Medicare,	4	2
They won't stop until they ban personal property.	4	2
Storm our houses and rape our wives.	4	2
Mmm. Mmm.	4	2
Man your battle stations!	4	2
Nice dress. Where's Mr. Holloway?	4	2
Saving lives.	4	2
Everyone, ladies, come on, let's go.	4	2
Don't forget it's a party.	4	2
Please please.	4	2
I walked in here five minutes ago, no one did anything.	4	2
Merry Christmas, Lee. That's quite a tan.	4	2
I work at it. When can we expepe something for lucky strike	4	2
As good as let me out of here!	4	2
Well, glo-coat told me to swing for the fences.	4	2
Well, I didn't know I had to ask, Donny.	4	2
We have gifts, girls and games,	4	2
But first I'm going to get you some food.	4	2
Well, that's a good idea, red.	4	2
I've been drinking all day.	4	2
Don't turn on the lights, shithead.	4	2
Come on.	4	2
If you hear anything, run. Don't worry about me.	4	2
Whoo!	4	2
Megan, can you get Mr. Garner a drink?	4	2
- Where's Santa? - He didn't show,	4	2
But he did leave some presents.	4	2
- Joan. - Well, I could've sworn	4	2
I conga'ed by a suit.	4	2
- You want to be Santa? - Hell no.	4	2
How about you, Roger?	4	2
I would but I'm allergic to velvet.	4	2
Come on. You'll do great.	4	2
- Are you serious? - Damn straight.	4	2
I don't think so.	4	2
I'll do it. I'd love to be Santa.	4	2
- Yes. - Oh, come on.	4	2
It'd take three of you to fill that suit.	4	2
Besides, everybody knows Santa's got white hair.	4	2
Put it on, Roger.	4	2
Come on, Lee.	4	2
Put it on.	4	2
He's a hell of a sport.	4	2
Everybody just stay there.	4	2
- Call the police. - Is somebody in the house?	4	2
Maybe it's a bear.	4	2
Hello?	4	2
I'm guessing it's kids.	4	2
Let me look around the house.	4	2
- Hello? - Just stay here.	4	2
Where's your lovely wife, lane?	4	2
She and my son are in London.	4	2
I shall be joining them soon enough.	4	2
Mine's in Florida. I guess we'll suffer through, eh, Jeeves?	4	2
- Mmm. Ho ho ho!	4	2
Merry Christmas!	4	2
It's hard to tell if he's father Christmas or father time.	4	2
Merry Christmas!	4	2
That's a big bag, Roger.	4	2
Don't want you to have a third heart attack.	4	2
Right, honey?	4	2
What have we here?	4	2
What do all the good boys and girls want for Christmas?	4	2
- Lucky strike! Thank you.	4	2
You're welcome. Don't smoke those all at once.	4	2
And I have a very special present	4	2
For a little boy who knows he's been naughty.	4	2
Lee.	4	2
You didn't need to do that.	4	2
Yes, we did.	4	2
Look at that.	4	2
It's a Polaroid.	4	2
Thank you.	4	2
It reminds me of when I was a kid.	4	2
Remember that?	4	2
You'd ask for something, you'd get it	4	2
And it made you happy.	4	2
Merry Christmas!	4	2
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart. - Merry Christmas, don.	4	2
Ho ho ho!	4	2
There's eggs in my bed!	4	2
You can sleep in our room if you want.	4	2
My room's fine.	4	2
- Anybody home? - Not for much longer.	4	2
I can't leave until Geoff and Bert Cooper	4	2
Figure out how to take food from children.	4	2
Well, if anyone can do it...	4	2
How many Christmas parties do you have to go to?	4	2
I pity you. Please, sit down.	4	2
No, I just want to make sure there were no problems.	4	2
You really are a full-service company.	4	2
It's just you didn't take the test	4	2
And I know you're the creative shaman around here,	4	2
But you walked out of my presentation.	4	2
I'm disappointed.	4	2
I thought you came in to flirt, but you came in to fight.	4	2
You have to know I found out all I could about you.	4	2
Your work is very interesting	4	2
And I guess I was hoping you thought mine was.	4	2
It's not personal. I just don't think	4	2
You can learn much about people that way.	4	2
I learned a lot about you.	4	2
You're the kind of man who doesn't want to take the test.	4	2
I'm sorry. I just don't see	4	2
How knowing about my childhood is gonna help sell floor wax.	4	2
I saw that ad.	4	2
It's all about somebody's childhood.	4	2
Look, we're both in the same business.	4	2
I'm not embarrassed to say	4	2
It's about helping people somehow to sort out their deepest conflict.	4	2
And what is that?	4	2
In a nutshell,	4	2
It all comes down to what I want versus what's expected of me.	4	2
- That's true. - I know it's true.	4	2
You would've known it's true if you'd stayed for my presentation.	4	2
Want to get some dinner or something?	4	2
No thank you.	4	2
But apology accepted.	4	2
Look, I know the holidays are hard in your situation,	4	2
But don't worry. You'll be married again in a year.	4	2
What?	4	2
I'm sorry.	4	2
I always forget... nobody wants to think they're a type.	4	2
Merry Christmas.	4	2
Merry Christmas.	4	2
Harry. Your turn.	4	2
Sorry sorry sorry.	4	2
Shit.	4	2
I don't see anything.	4	2
Oh. Here they are.	4	2
- I got 'em. - Great.	4	2
Be right there.	4	2
- Forgot his keys. - I'll give you a half an hour	4	2
- And then we'll meet you at Chumley's. - Make it an hour.	4	2
- Might have to get some food in him. - He's pathetic.	4	2
Hello?	4	2
- I'm really sorry. - It's okay.	4	2
Switched my plans a little bit.	4	2
I'm getting you aspirin. Don't say no.	4	2
Top right cabinet.	4	2
- How about some food? - No.	4	2
- Thank you. - Okay.	4	2
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.	4	2
Don't.	4	2
Don't what?	4	2
You smell so good.	4	2
I feel dizzy.	4	2
My goodness.	4	2
I know.	4	2
Oh! I'm supposed to meet somebody.	4	2
Oh.	4	2
I should really go.	4	2
You sure?	4	2
Yes.	4	2
I, uh...	4	2
I understand. It's okay.	4	2
Okay.	4	2
See you tomorrow, I guess.	4	2
Freddy.	4	2
I'm sorry I'm at your desk.	4	2
It was the cleanest spot in the office.	4	2
Are you okay? You didn't come to the party.	4	2
Oh.	4	2
It's been my experience	4	2
That when they give you that Santa suit,	4	2
There's usually a bottle already in the pocket.	4	2
Oh.	4	2
Thank God.	4	2
I don't want to worry that every time I hurt your feelings	4	2
You're gonna start drinking again.	4	2
Then why don't you stop hurting my feelings?	4	2
I'm sorry.	4	2
I'm sorry I said you were old-fashioned.	4	2
And I'm sorry I said you wanted to get married.	4	2
I do want to get married.	4	2
Well, you've got to work less and find somebody.	4	2
I have a boyfriend.	4	2
Is it serious?	4	2
I don't know yet.	4	2
He won't leave me alone.	4	2
It was that way with Violet.	4	2
Insatiable.	4	2
Oh.	4	2
Oh. Freddy, I don't want to talk about this.	4	2
Hey, you brought it up.	4	2
I haven't done much work on this, I have to be honest.	4	2
I need to get some coffee.	4	2
Fine.	4	2
I don't want to be alone on new year's eve.	4	2
My two cents?	4	2
If you're gonna marry him, you can't do anything.	4	2
He won't respect you.	4	2
What if I don't know?	4	2
Well, you can't lead him on.	4	2
That is physically very uncomfortable.	4	2
It's not a joke.	4	2
Did you enjoy the fuhrer's birthday?	4	2
May he live for a thousand years.	4	2
Oh, my father used to say this is the greatest job in the world	4	2
Except for one thing... the clients.	4	2
Good morning.	4	2
Did you make it home last night?	4	2
I did. I did.	4	2
Come inside.	4	2
- What's all this? - For your children.	4	2
I bought them the other day,	4	2
But I finally got them wrapped.	4	2
Thank you.	4	2
Want me to get the door?	4	2
No.	4	2
Do you need some coffee?	4	2
I had some.	4	2
It was quite a party.	4	2
- I really overdid it. - Me too.	4	2
I, uh...	4	2
Thank you for bringing my keys.	4	2
I really appreciate it.	4	2
I've probably taken advantage of your kindness	4	2
On too many occasions.	4	2
Excuse me?	4	2
I just wanted to say thank you for bringing my keys.	4	2
Okay.	4	2
I know we talked about how tough things are for the firm,	4	2
But I wanted you to know...	4	2
Well, here's the bonus we talked about.	4	2
Merry Christmas.	4	2
Thank you.	4	2
Anything else for right now?	4	2
No.	4	2
Hey.	4	2
- Are you all right? - Yeah, of course.	4	2
Do you feel different?	4	2
Remind me, when did you stop taking the pills?	4	3
They ran out on the 2nd.	4	3
I'd say I would expect to be fertile again at the end of the cycle,	4	3
although from my experience, it's more likely a month.	4	3
All this time I've been afraid to skip one, but it could take a month?	4	3
Why don't you join him for basic training? It would boost the men's morale.	4	3
From what I remember, San Antonio is lovely this time of year.	4	3
We don't know when he's going.	4	3
You've been married two years, Joan? Most gals your age don't wait.	4	3
We have a plan.	4	3
JoJo, I know it's none of my business,	4	3
 but I only went to Korea because they made me.	4	3
I didn't have a choice or a wife.	4	3
All I want to know is if my husband and I can start a family...	4	3
When my husband and I can start a family.	4	3
Go get them.	4	3
-Walter. -Yes?	4	3
I just want to make sure that...	4	3
Well, you know I've had a couple of procedures.	4	3
I just want to make sure they don't affect anything.	4	3
A couple? I only remember one.	4	3
There was one before that. Should I be worried?	4	3
Was the other performed by a physician?	4	3
She said she was a midwife.	4	3
Well, you got pregnant subsequently, and I know everything went fine here.	4	3
 And, physically, everything looks fine.	4	3
"Like the song says, ""Whatever will be, will be."""	4	3
Happy New Year.	4	3
-Good morning, Mr. Draper. -Good morning, Allison.	4	3
Coffee?	4	3
Yes, please.	4	3
I'm glad I caught you before you left.	4	3
The flight's not until 12:30.	4	3
Well, still, you've got to tight the tourists for a taxi,	4	3
and then if you hit traffic, Triborough Bridge,	4	3
somebody's always running out of gas, and I think you know who.	4	3
So I saw, on your way to Acapulco, you have 24 hours in Los Angeles.	4	3
What do you want?	4	3
The Brown Derby, Bill Asher. He'll probably try to cast you.	4	3
-Morning, Don, Harry. -Hello.	4	3
-Am I interrupting? -No.	4	3
I'll see you at the traffic meeting this afternoon.	4	3
We're still doing that? Why?	4	3
Just go to England already. Stop feeling guilty.	4	3
Take two weeks. You'll be twice as happy.	4	3
I'm happy when I'm working.	4	3
And I'm sure another day and a half of work will not come close	4	3
to the amount of fiddling about you did in Los Angeles this year.	4	3
Okay. Happy New Year, Don.	4	3
There you are. Please make sure he signs these.	4	3
If I don't see you, happy New Year.	4	3
Enjoy your family.	4	3
-Would you like to sign these now? -Might as well.	4	3
So, what will you be doing?	4	3
Don't worry. I'll be here till the bitter end.	4	3
No, I mean for New Year's.	4	3
I'm gonna go see my sister in Paterson over the weekend,	4	3
and, I don't know, probably Times Square.	4	3
I always wondered who did that.	4	3
It was a little scary last year,	4	3
but I think we'll have a whole bunch of girls this time.	4	3
-And sailors. -I'm sure.	4	3
But for the rest of the week, if you want me or someone else on your desk	4	3
-for West Coast hours, I can arrange that. -I'll be fine.	4	3
Well, I'll let you know when you should leave.	4	3
Thank you.	4	3
Why is the door shut?	4	3
I don't like pipe smoke. He's very considerate.	4	3
-Could you tell him I'm here? -What is this regarding?	4	3
Sorry to bother you, but since Roger's not here,	4	3
I am sending Caroline uptown to get me some fried chicken for lunch,	4	3
and I know you like it. Interested?	4	3
I am.	4	3
Breast? Thigh?	4	3
One of each.	4	3
I wanted to ask you, I would like to put in a request now	4	3
for a few days off the second week of January.	4	3
But you have New Year's off.	4	3
My husband's a doctor. His schedule's not flexible.	4	3
Why don't you go home and ask him how he would feel	4	3
about some nurse asking for a holiday immediately following a holiday?	4	3
I would be happy with two days.	4	3
Our financial planning and expense budgets for next year,	4	3
I'll need you to assist me.	4	3
We can do it now. No one Knows why we're here anyway.	4	3
Because there's work to do.	4	3
And I understand that all men are dizzy and powerless to refuse you,	4	3
but consider me the incorruptible exception.	4	3
Fried chicken indeed.	4	3
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.	4	3
Now don't go and cry about it.	4	3
Excuse me?	4	3
I said, don't go and cry about it.	4	3
Hey.	4	3
Get off my porch.	4	3
You actually came.	4	3
What the hell happened to your leg?	4	3
It's broken. It didn't work that well to begin with.	4	3
How are you?	4	3
You just need a little R&R.	4	3
What happened?	4	3
Here's the lesson. Don't fry eggs in bare feet.	4	3
Sit down.	4	3
-What do you want? -Half of what you have.	4	3
You've got a leak.	4	3
I fixed the roof. It just needs a little makeup.	4	3
Call a painter.	4	3
I don't know. Once it stopped smelling, I kind of forgot about it.	4	3
I wondered whose car that was. Hello, Dick-	4	3
-Hello, Patty. it's been too long. -Stephanie.	4	3
Stephanie. Last time I saw you, you didn't have front teeth.	4	3
They're helping me while I'm in my fragile state,	4	3
although no one asked them to.	4	3
Can I get you something?	4	3
No, we live in South Pasadena. It's a long drive.	4	3
-Are you staying? -Just for the night.	4	3
-Here? -Patty,	4	3
remember you told me to tell you if you were intruding?	4	3
Try to keep her off her feet.	4	3
The cast isn't stable, and we don't need any more accidents.	4	3
Aunt Anna, I just left everything on the bed. I don't Know where things go.	4	3
You can tell by looking.	4	3
She's never gotten over me flunking home-ec.	4	3
Dick, fix her a drink.	4	3
-Are you drinking age? -Yes, but don't bother.	4	3
Stephanie is studying Poli Sci at Cal. She should be studying music.	4	3
Berkeley? Are you sitting in?	4	3
I agree with what they're doing, but somebody's gotta go to class.	4	3
-Steph, are you ready? -Why don't you two stay for dinner?	4	3
Glenn and I have a bridge game at the Dicksons',	4	3
and he's expecting a dinner of his own.	4	3
Good, 'cause I only want her to stay.	4	3
How will she get home?	4	3
I have a car.	4	3
Or she'll spend the night. You can get her in the morning.	4	3
Okay, you figure it out. Good night, sweetheart.	4	3
You know I'm very grateful.	4	3
-If I don't see you, Dick, happy New Year. -Happy New Year.	4	3
I'm going to wash the road off me,	4	3
and then we are going to that place with the beer and abalone.	4	3
Perfect. Sounds like there's towels all over the bed.	4	3
Why am I staying?	4	3
I wanted him to meet you, and I know you've got grass.	4	3
Hello.	4	3
Come over here.	4	3
Is that your dinner?	4	3
I love your chicken.	4	3
How was the doctor?	4	3
Everything's good.	4	3
Good. I have to go.	4	3
Let me at least heat it up. You can take it with you.	4	3
Peabody's offered his place in the Poconos for the 14th and 15th.	4	3
Greg, I can't get away, not then.	4	3
Jeanie, I have to work New Year's. I had to trade it for January.	4	3
Then get one of the Jewish docs to do it. You worked on their holiday.	4	3
Jeanie, you don't think I'd rather be smelling perfume than Lysol?	4	3
Tell me what you want me to do.	4	3
Because it's not your problem, too?	4	3
Why don't you just not show up?	4	3
I'll lose my job.	4	3
-We'll make it. -Until when?	4	3
Until I leave for basic,	4	3
and then it's just a couple of weeks, and then I'll be home.	4	3
And then you're going to Vietnam.	4	3
We don't know that.	4	3
That makes me feel better.	4	3
Just keep marking off the days on the calendar	4	3
while I keep planning for our future.	4	3
I'll see you tomorrow when you're on your way out.	4	3
You don't even know when you're going!	4	3
Soon.	4	3
So I'd say Laura was the worst roommate.	4	3
She had a nervous breakdown-	4	3
One morning, she's reading the Bible instead of her psych book.	4	3
The next morning she woke me up, leaning over me with this crazy smile	4	3
"and said, ""Morning, Stephanie. Have you heard the good news?"""	4	3
There are worse things.	4	3
No, there aren't.	4	3
Where did you go to school, Dick?	4	3
I strung together a few nonconsecutive years	4	3
in night school, City College.	4	3
A self-made man.	4	3
What's it like taking off your suit and returning to the wild?	4	3
I really don't like how political you're getting.	4	3
I'm not political. I just don't understand who's in charge.	4	3
You're in charge.	4	3
Trust me. I work in advertising.	4	3
You're kidding me.	4	3
It's pollution.	4	3
So stop buying things.	4	3
Don't think that's not possible.	4	3
I'll say this in terms you'll understand.	4	3
I will be right back after this brief message from Jan and Dean.	4	3
I like to think I had a bit of a hand in that.	4	3
You and God.	4	3
Young people are gonna save us.	4	3
How would you feel about me bringing the kids out this spring?	4	3
Really?	4	3
You know how badly I've wanted to meet them.	4	3
So what, I'll be their aunt?	4	3
Wait till they tell Betty that.	4	3
You told me you told her everything. She'll understand.	4	3
I don't think she'll ever understand.	4	3
You had to know she'd be hurt.	4	3
After I told her, I felt relieved.	4	3
I kept thinking how small it was compared to how long it went on.	4	3
-Small? -I know. I know.	4	3
It's just...	4	3
I could tell.	4	3
The minute she saw who I really was,	4	3
she never wanted to look at me again.	4	3
Which is why I never told her.	4	3
Dick.	4	3
I'm sorry she broke your heart.	4	3
I had it coming.	4	3
I thought I'd play something so you two could dance.	4	3
How the hell am I gonna dance?	4	3
I don't know how you ever danced to this.	4	3
Come on.	4	3
Keep your hands at 10:00 and 2:00.	4	3
So you picked this song because it's old?	4	3
That doesn't mean it's bad.	4	3
It's kind of corny.	4	3
I think it sounds like she's inviting us to a very beautiful place	4	3
where there's no surfing at all.	4	3
Have you ever been there?	4	3
No.	4	3
But every time I hear this song, I want to go.	4	3
I know for a fact you did not break that leg making eggs.	4	3
I used to love sitting, and now that I have to, I hate it.	4	3
I should get home.	4	3
I'll drive you. I'll put the top up.	4	3
That's okay. I'll hitch.	4	3
I do it all the time.	4	3
You'll get picked up by some creep.	4	3
I guess this is safer.	4	3
So, are you married or divorced?	4	3
Couldn't I just be single?	4	3
No. I mean, I'd be surprised.	4	3
I'm divorced.	4	3
Do you go on those dates where you sit there	4	3
and ask each other questions?	4	3
It's a means to an end.	4	3
But nobody knows what's wrong with themselves,	4	3
and everyone else can see it right away.	4	3
-Thank you very much. -it's my pleasure.	4	3
So, what time's your flight tomorrow?	4	3
Noon.	4	3
Unless you think I should change it.	4	3
What are you doing?	4	3
I don't know.	4	3
You're so beautiful and young.	4	3
Anna and I never had a romantic relationship.	4	3
But you love her.	4	3
For lots of reasons.	4	3
And in a very different way.	4	3
I have to tell you something,	4	3
and I probably shouldn't.	4	3
I promised I wouldn't,	4	3
but I see you two together, and I know I have to.	4	3
Okay.	4	3
Anna is...	4	3
She has cancer-	4	3
-What? -it's why she broke her leg.	4	3
It's in her bones. it's all over her body.	4	3
I'm sorry.	4	3
Cancer. Shit.	4	3
I'm so sorry.	4	3
Of course she's not gonna say a damn thing.	4	3
She doesn't know.	4	3
What?	4	3
The doctors said she doesn't have long, so there's no reason to tell her.	4	3
Some quacks out in Pedro? What are you going to do about it?	4	3
My mom got a consultation.	4	3
Your mother does not get to decide that.	4	3
Please don't make me sorry that I told you.	4	3
I didn't want you to leave here and not know.	4	3
Good morning.	4	3
I woke up in a panic because I thought I might've missed you-	4	3
But it doesn't look like you're ready to go.	4	3
-I thought I'd stay a little longer, if it's okay. -Hell yes.	4	3
Stay as long as you want.	4	3
We'll see.	4	3
If I had rolled over on this, I would've had to smoke the dress.	4	3
How'd you sleep?	4	3
I was feeling no pain, as they say.	4	3
In fact, I don't know if I would've woken up if I hadn't heard that jet fly by.	4	3
"And I thought, ""Oh, my God. Dick left already."""	4	3
There's all kinds of aircraft here, you know.	4	3
If we stay up tonight and we get lucky, we'll see something you'll remember.	4	3
If we keep smoking that.	4	3
I've seen UFOs.	4	3
There was a lot going on during the missile scare,	4	3
but it was different.	4	3
You saw a UFO?	4	3
You don't have to do that, you know.	4	3
I want to.	4	3
I'm not gonna fight watching Dick Whitman paint my living room in his shorts.	4	3
I'm so damn proud of you.	4	3
I count on it.	4	3
Does that scare you?	4	3
The idea of another civilization on another planet	4	3
smart enough to find a way to get here?	4	3
It doesn't scare me, but the odds are against it.	4	3
Well, I saw something once,	4	3
and I'm telling you, it knocked me sideways.	4	3
I started thinking of everything I was sure was true	4	3
and how flimsy it all might be.	4	3
You don't need to see a UFO to know that.	4	3
That's not a great way to think about things.	4	3
I know everything about you, and I still love you.	4	3
Are you just gonna paint that corner?	4	3
'Cause a patch of new paint is just as bad as a stain.	4	3
What the hell is going on?	4	3
You're gonna get arrested.	4	3
No, you are. That's breaking and entering.	4	3
I thought you had a flight to catch.	4	3
I changed my plans.	4	3
You just can't keep your pants on, can you?	4	3
You never know what's gonna set her off.	4	3
-I need to talk to you. -I bet.	4	3
I heard your car pull up at 2:30. She's half your age.	4	3
What's your plan?	4	3
Just gonna let her wake up one day in agony and you tell her it's over?	4	3
I'm going to assume	4	3
that you've done everything in your limited means,	4	3
but I'm here now.	4	3
She's gonna see some real doctors, and she's not gonna live in the dark.	4	3
We showed the X-rays to specialists, everybody.	4	3
It's very advanced.	4	3
Specialists? You don't think she knows something's going on?	4	3
She had polio. She's been going to doctors since she was eight. Maybe...	4	3
I don't know.	4	3
She hasn't let on, so this is the way it's gonna be.	4	3
I understand you feel guilty, but don't.	4	3
Go to Acapulco. There's nothing for you to do here.	4	3
She is very important to me.	4	3
I'm gonna do what I have to.	4	3
You have no say in the affairs of this family.	4	3
You're just a man in a room with a checkbook. I'm sorry.	4	3
Please do the decent thing.	4	3
The longer you're here, the more likely you are to say something.	4	3
She thinks you brought the pot, I bet.	4	3
If it wasn't for my niece, we'd have killed each other by now.	4	3
She means well, and she's family.	4	3
I wouldn't have picked her.	4	3
I'm just saying not everybody has that.	4	3
You have your kids. I bet that's better.	4	3
It's different.	4	3
I have to tell you something.	4	3
What's wrong?	4	3
I have to go.	4	3
I'm sorry.	4	3
I thought I could stay, but I can't.	4	3
I don't care.	4	3
I want you to.	4	3
I want you to do everything you want to do.	4	3
I'll bring the kids out at Easter.	4	3
We'll go to Catalina, see the bison.	4	3
Acapulco.	4	3
Do you think there's more Mexicans here or there?	4	3
Joan.	4	3
Open it.	4	3
They're beautiful.	4	3
It's so encouraging to see someone happily married around here.	4	3
Peggy, why don't you go home?	4	3
I'll tell everyone you have something important to do.	4	3
Really? I have to buy a dress.	4	3
New Year's Eve, big group of girls, you'll want to stand out.	4	3
No, I'm spending it with Mark. My boyfriend?	4	3
Happy New Year.	4	3
Excuse me.	4	3
"-""Darling, I've been an ass. Kisses, Lane""? -What?"	4	3
I am not your darling, and I don't want your kisses.	4	3
-What? -I thought American men were bad enough,	4	3
but none of them has ever so consistently	4	3
made me feel like a helpless, stupid little girl.	4	3
Calm down. I did send you flowers, but I also sent flowers to my wife in London.	4	3
The sentiments were very different, I assure you. Sandy!	4	3
-Is everything okay? -Yes.	4	3
Just get back to work. Sandy!	4	3
Did it ever occur to you how sensitive these deliveries were?	4	3
How often do I send flowers?	4	3
I ordered the flowers from Rhinelander's.	4	3
They assured me they were going to contact your florist in London,	4	3
and somehow they mixed them up. It's not my fault.	4	3
Sandra, everyone makes mistakes,	4	3
but the fact that you're the kind of person who cannot accept blame is egregious.	4	3
I don't know what that means.	4	3
It means I can't believe I hired you.	4	3
You had one simple task.	4	3
I don't even know if I can call to apologize.	4	3
What exactly did Mrs. Harris' note say?	4	3
"It said, ""Joan, forgive me. Lane."""	4	3
You're fired. Go get your things. You'll be paid through the end of the year.	4	3
Those instructions you understood!	4	3
I'll have Megan clean this up.	4	3
What are you doing?	4	3
You inspired me.	4	3
Would you like to sign your work?	4	3
-Really? -Pick a spot on the wall.	4	3
You should swim as much as you can there.	4	3
It'll clear your head.	4	3
But no cliff diving.	4	3
Hey. You'll be fine.	4	3
You'll make the best of it. You always do.	4	3
You know you can call me if you need anything.	4	3
Goodbye, Anna.	4	3
Goodbye, Dick.	4	3
Mn Draper?	4	3
Mr. Draper?	4	3
-Happy New Year. -Happy New Year.	4	3
Hey, what are you doing up?	4	3
I figured since we missed it here, we could celebrate it in Hawaii.	4	3
Look at that.	4	3
I'm sorry. I ate dinner at 3:00.	4	3
A bowl of cottage cheese in the cafeteria?	4	3
How about a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice?	4	3
Sure.	4	3
The nurses spent five minutes trying to get this girl's contact lenses out.	4	3
She was screaming.	4	3
It turns out her friend was the one with the contact lenses.	4	3
God!	4	3
-Oh, God. -Let me see.	4	3
-I cut it really bad, Greg. It really hurts. -Jesus.	4	3
Hold this.	4	3
-Just take me to the hospital. -Sit down.	4	3
Greg, you don't have to do this.	4	3
Would you stop?	4	3
Isn't there some medical ethical law against operating on your wife?	4	3
I want you to calm down.	4	3
For me, this is like, I don't know, filing some papers is for you.	4	3
I do it all the time.	4	3
I don't do that anymore. I have other people do that.	4	3
It's really throbbing. Let me get my coat.	4	3
Hey, since when have we had that bird's nest on the ceiling?	4	3
I usually save that for kids.	4	3
Now, don't move.	4	3
One hillbilly says to the other,	4	3
"""You wanna play 20 questions?"""	4	3
"The other hillbilly says, ""What is that?"""	4	3
"He says, ""I write something on a piece of paper,"	4	3
"""and you get 20 questions to guess what it be."""	4	3
"So he takes out a piece of paper and writes ""donkey dick"" on it."	4	3
The other hillbilly takes a second to think	4	3
"and asks, ""Can I eat it?"""	4	3
"The other hillbilly says, ""I might reckon you could."""	4	3
The other one says,	4	3
"""Is it donkey dick?"""	4	3
Cohen told me that.	4	3
Come on. it's fine.	4	3
I'm not crying 'cause it hurts.	4	3
Everything's gonna be okay.	4	3
When?	4	3
Jeanie.	4	3
I can't fix anything else,	4	3
but I can fix this.	4	3
Hello?	4	3
Hello?	4	3
I thought you were in Acapulco.	4	3
I didn't feel like it.	4	3
You should be in England with your family.	4	3
Too much to do. They'll be back soon enough.	4	3
I have a sandwich in the refrigerator. It's very large.	4	3
No, thank you. Do you mind?	4	3
Help yourself.	4	3
I received something rather special from my father	4	3
-for my birthday. -What is it?	4	3
Who knows?	4	3
He's one of those alcoholics who thinks that he's collecting.	4	3
Chin-chin.	4	3
-There's no... -No bite at all.	4	3
Well,	4	3
I will let you get back to your business.	4	3
I made a discovery as I slowly pulled back from the records.	4	3
I can't take any more bad news, Lane.	4	3
Although things are precarious financially,	4	3
it's been a magnificent year.	4	3
Lane!	4	3
-What? -Come here.	4	3
We're going to the movies.	4	3
-Do you think we should? -Does Howdy Doody have a wooden dick?	4	3
Zorba the Greek, seen it, but would see it again.	4	3
It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World. No kidding.	4	3
-Send Me No Flowers. -No.	4	3
The Guns of August.	4	3
I hate guns and I hate August.	4	3
It's all over the rug.	4	3
We'll have to smoke the dress.	4	3
Well, I don't know that one.	4	3
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.	4	3
Catherine Deneuve.	4	3
Apparently, it's for all the young lovers of the world.	4	3
This movie is very good.	4	3
You know what's going on here, don't you?	4	3
-Handjobs. -ls that right?	4	3
What percentage do you think?	4	3
Do you mind?	4	3
Monster!	4	3
You like it here?	4	3
I do. I do. Even alone.	4	3
You remind me of a chap I knew in school.	4	3
We followed him around in a pack, and he didn't notice we were there.	4	3
He died in a motorcycle crash.	4	3
Rebecca convinced me that you were all on holiday together	4	3
without me.	4	3
I suppose we haven't been very welcoming.	4	3
Campbell's friendly, although I believe unintentionally.	4	3
But my wife is quite severe with people, including me.	4	3
I'm sorry to hear that.	4	3
I wanted to bring our families to New York for the holidays,	4	3
but she was terribly homesick.	4	3
We had an argument, a series of arguments, and she left.	4	3
I then weakened and sent her flowers.	4	3
Tried to, anyway.	4	3
Then we had a rather solemn phone call in which she told me she was not returning.	4	3
Then she put my son on the phone.	4	3
That's tough.	4	3
How did you know when you were done?	4	3
It wasn't my decision.	4	3
And I've learned the hard way not to give advice in these situations.	4	3
You were supposed to tell me to get on a plane.	4	3
Is that what you want?	4	3
Or is that what people expect of you?	4	3
I want my beef.	4	3
Here it is.	4	3
I was going to call a lady friend of mine.	4	3
I'm supposed to meet her downtown.	4	3
Do you want her to bring a friend?	4	3
No, no. No, thank you.	4	3
What are you gonna do?	4	3
We can pretend it's New Year's. It actually is.	4	3
If you don't mind.	4	3
It's the least I can do.	4	3
-I'm not hungry. -What?	4	3
Not hungry for this beautiful piece of American meat?	4	3
Look at me!	4	3
I got a big Texas belt buckle!	4	3
"I'm thinking, ""Did my mother get suspicious and Call the fuzz?"""	4	3
”We know you're practicing self-abuse. Please come out with your hand up. ”	4	3
I see we have an anniversary here tonight.	4	3
Look at these two, George and Martha.	4	3
Tell me, what's it like when your eyes meet across a crowded men 's room?	4	3
Wall Street, does it bother your parents that he's so ugly?	4	3
So we all want to know at the end of the night,	4	3
when it's just the two of you, who picks up the check?	4	3
We're not homosexuals! We're divorced!	4	3
Don't.	4	3
Man- Now they're gonna fight in the car all the way home.	4	3
"""Honey why'd you provoke the comedian?"""	4	3
Okay, now welcome a talented young musician	4	3
whose mother says he's the next Bob Dylan.	4	3
-Candace, this is Lane. -And this is my friend Janine.	4	3
-Hello. -A pleasure.	4	3
I guess I was wrong. You're not queers. You're rich.	4	3
A warm welcome for Rudy Jensen.	4	3
-You ladies look lovely. -Why, thank you.	4	3
It's true.	4	3
I love this song.	4	3
-Really? He wrote it. -Don't. She'll believe anything.	4	3
What?	4	3
Let's get out of here.	4	3
You have no mixers at all and no food.	4	3
I love your apartment. It's very manly.	4	3
It came this way. I think Norman Mailer shot a deer over there.	4	3
I love deer.	4	3
Get your tail in here and help me.	4	3
She seems to know her way around in your kitchen.	4	3
What's that like?	4	3
I told you I don't like giving advice in these situations.	4	3
Why don't you show me around?	4	3
I suppose I am a bit curious myself.	4	3
Not in there.	4	3
What happened to Acapulco?	4	3
She does not go to Barnard.	4	3
Guys like him like that.	4	3
-Come on. Let's go in the other room. -No.	4	3
Here.	4	3
Morning.	4	3
Morning.	4	3
I'm terribly thirsty.	4	3
We'll have coffee in a minute.	4	3
Just a glass of water, please.	4	3
What do I owe you for the evening?	4	3
-Don't worry about it. -I should pay.	4	3
The girl, how much was she?	4	3
$25.	4	3
Fascinating.	4	3
Here's $30.	4	3
Well, I shall be running along.	4	3
Thank you for the welcome distraction.	4	3
Sorry.	4	3
All right. Gentlemen, shall we begin 1965?	4	3
Lee, Lee, Don doesn't think there's a problem.	4	4
Lee, those restrictions aren't going to affect Lucky Strike.	4	4
Besides, Lee, your lawyers came up with them.	4	4
"""No more smoking teenagers,"" we complied a year ago."	4	4
"""No more famous athletes"""	4	4
and we have to stop using certain angles.	4	4
Low angles, wide lenses,	4	4
anything that makes the smoker appear superhuman.	4	4
Why is this empty?	4	4
Because you drank it all.	4	4
-He can't hear you. -There's kind of a loophole	4	4
 because even without athletes you can still use sports.	4	4
Bowling, for example, seems a natural Ht.	4	4
Bowling is a sport, Lee.	4	4
How about horse-racing?	4	4
Lee, Lee, the jockey smokes the cigarette.	4	4
Did either of you ladies bring any ice with you?	4	4
We're sorting out the focus group for Pond's and I haven't gotten the hypothesis,	4	4
in writing anyway.	4	4
"He said, ""Don."""	4	4
We'll do our best. Peggy, write it up.	4	4
You haven't okayed the brief.	4	4
I liked your idea. I liked it a lot.	4	4
The mirror one or the cleansing one?	4	4
What's the mirror one?	4	4
 Well, I think it's about the ritual, the multiple applications, indulgence.	4	4
Pond's is the only cold cream that allows me	4	4
to stare at myself in the mirror for 20 minutes	4	4
and feel good and not vain.	4	4
That's very good.	4	4
So, we're talking about girls, 18 to 25.	4	4
Can I grab a few from around here?	4	4
Yeah, help yourself.	4	4
See, I would never buy a sailboat.	4	4
I don't want to do things myself.	4	4
For that price, that boat should have a motor.	4	4
A what?	4	4
-One of those, too. -Anything else?	4	4
I don't know. Why don't you ask Don about that?	4	4
I have to go to the little boys' room.	4	4
I'm sorry, Lee, can you go through that one more time?	4	4
That's the Lucky Strike call? Why wasn't I told?	4	4
Be happy. I saved you an ass-ache.	4	4
So what's so bad he couldn't tell me?	4	4
Cal Rutledge from Chesebrough-Pond's has a wild hair about Clearasil.	4	4
He thinks they're in conflict.	4	4
Pimple cream and cold cream?	4	4
A rather broad definition.	4	4
Does it matter?	4	4
Look, Pete, we're going to have to resign the Clearasil account.	4	4
-Why? -Lane.	4	4
It can't be up for debate.	4	4
Clearasil is worth $1.25 million in billings, and Pond's over two.	4	4
No.	4	4
You know what it took to get my father-in-law	4	4
to join this new firm to begin with?	4	4
Fifteen percent of $750,000 is near $113,000.	4	4
Roger, I don't expect him to understand this,	4	4
but do you have any idea of what I've had to do to keep that account?	4	4
The personal toll I've paid?	4	4
I do, but you've been good to him, remember that, sales-wise.	4	4
-Mr. Sterling? -I don't believe this.	4	4
-Roger. -Throw yourself on a grenade.	4	4
Protect the agency. You're a partner now.	4	4
This evening if you can.	4	4
Over half this agency is dedicated to your needs,	4	4
but if you want to get into the line-by-line	4	4
of the costs we've billed for,	4	4
I'll have Lane Pryce at the foot of your bed in 20 minutes.	4	4
Oh, my God, there's some kind of fire.	4	4
Right down by Radio City.	4	4
Roger, we should go. Sorry, Lee.	4	4
We gotta go. Okay, bye-bye.	4	4
Should I type all this up?	4	4
Yes. And remind me to remind Caroline to tell Lane	4	4
that Lucky Strike noticed that they're being billed	4	4
for all the work we do for everybody else at this agency.	4	4
You know what? I don't want that on paper.	4	4
-Who is that? -A dear friend.	4	4
Is that the letter from California?	4	4
Yes.	4	4
-I hate this office. -You wanted to be close to Roger.	4	4
Make yourself at home, why don't you?	4	4
Did you see Sunday's paper?	4	4
If this is about the Playtex ad they keep complaining about,	4	4
I've been told the printer swapped paper stocks.	4	4
And I don't care if she looks like a Puerto Rican.	4	4
Puerto Rican girls buy brassieres.	4	4
Not that they need to.	4	4
I saw this one on the subway in one of those striped Jean Seberg shirts,	4	4
red rag in her hair, nipples...	4	4
I'm not in the mood. What do you want?	4	4
-Cosgrove's getting married. -So?	4	4
He took us to the opera last month, great seats, and now I know why.	4	4
It turns out her father shits gold ingots.	4	4
What does he do?	4	4
CFO of Corning.	4	4
My father-in-law's a bus driver.	4	4
The only place he can take me is to the moon.	4	4
Ken's the competition. Why are you going to the opera with him?	4	4
Geyer is twice our size, and we're friends, aren't we?	4	4
Friends.	4	4
Why are you always looking for a job?	4	4
What?	4	4
Look, Pete.	4	4
There's a group of us, we're all coming up together.	4	4
You don't think Kenny's a comer?	4	4
You know he has Mountain Dew? That's Pepsi.	4	4
We're having lunch tomorrow. Tag along. He always asks about you.	4	4
Of course he does.	4	4
Worst case, Kenny'll brag too much and you can steal a client from him.	4	4
Hello.	4	4
I'm sorry. That looks like bad news.	4	4
It's not mine. I'm Joyce. I work at Life, assistant photo editor.	4	4
Peggy Olson, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, copywriter.	4	4
Really?	4	4
Life magazine, I love the photos.	4	4
Well, you'll never see these.	4	4
I have to admit I'd be shocked.	4	4
He's my friend, and my boss hates nudes.	4	4
Who hates nudes?	4	4
That's a beautiful one.	4	4
I'm going to the mailroom. Peggy, right? 37th floor?	4	4
Tom, you're 15 minutes early.	4	4
So are you. Sit down.	4	4
We can eat anytime or not at all.	4	4
Excuse me. Dewar's on the rocks.	4	4
What's so important?	4	4
Tom, how are you feeling?	4	4
Couldn't be better.	4	4
I hope you know I've always done my best to make you happy.	4	4
I do.	4	4
And there's no reason, as far as I'm concerned,	4	4
that there should be any change in the way that we deal with each other.	4	4
Tom, I...	4	4
This is very hard for me to say.	4	4
I honestly don't know how you're going to take this	4	4
and it's been very hard to separate	4	4
our business relationship from the rest of our life,	4	4
but they should be separate.	4	4
You are some kind of high WASP, all right.	4	4
-Look, I can't keep this up. -Keep what up?	4	4
I heard.	4	4
You know?	4	4
You crazy kid.	4	4
What are you talking about?	4	4
Jeannie was with Trudy at the doctor. Congratulations!	4	4
What?	4	4
Oh, shit.	4	4
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.	4	4
It was Monday, for crying out loud. Why hasn't she told you?	4	4
I don't know.	4	4
Well, it may be her news, but it is good news.	4	4
You can't tell her that I told you. You can't.	4	4
I'm going to be a father?	4	4
Can you believe it?	4	4
-I'm going to be a father. -Yeah.	4	4
I feel like my heart's going to burst.	4	4
Champagne right here. Bring a bottle. We're going to tie one on.	4	4
If it's a boy, it's $1 ,000, a girl, $500.	4	4
I'll do what I can do.	4	4
You really can't tell Trudy.	4	4
I don't know howl let the cat out of the bag.	4	4
I thought you knew what I was talking about.	4	4
-What did you think I was talking about? -What?	4	4
Why did you have to see me?	4	4
I just wanted to...	4	4
We're putting new creative on Clearasil.	4	4
Fine. Who cares?	4	4
May you know this feeling many times.	4	4
I only had the one,	4	4
and I love her to death, but I wish we'd had more.	4	4
Jeannie had her uterus removed, some kind of a cyst or something.	4	4
Trudy!	4	4
I'm sick, Peter. I'm so sick about this.	4	4
Daddy just called me from a pay phone, drunk and in tears.	4	4
I know what you think. I just wanted to wait till our anniversary to tell you.	4	4
I don't care, Trudy.	4	4
I don't care how I heard.	4	4
Peter.	4	4
How did this happen? What did the doctor say?	4	4
He said I was going to have a baby.	4	4
I want to pick you up and spin you around,	4	4
but I don't want to damage anything in there.	4	4
I'm so happy you're happy.	4	4
I don't know. It feels much different than I expected.	4	4
How would you know what this feels like?	4	4
Come, get off your feet.	4	4
How are you feeling?	4	4
Tell me you'll forgive my father.	4	4
They already think you hate them and honestly, it's my fault.	4	4
I don't hate them.	4	4
I shouldn't have taken my mother to the doctor, not that doctor.	4	4
It's just... I thought something was going on,	4	4
and I was so prepared to be disappointed	4	4
or that, God forbid, something was really wrong.	4	4
Trudy, I had to talk to him because the agency has to drop Clearasil.	4	4
-Why? -There's another product that's similar,	4	4
-and we can't... -A conflict.	4	4
Peter, I'm familiar with the term. You use it all the time.	4	4
I invited him there and his good news trumped my bad news.	4	4
And the funny thing is, that was the moment to tell him.	4	4
I was so bowled over.	4	4
We did it.	4	4
Why don't you let my father hear this from me?	4	4
He's already so guilty, he'll never feel the knife go in.	4	4
I can't let you do that.	4	4
But I'm the one who talked him into returning to the agency to begin with.	4	4
-We needed him. -And now you don't.	4	4
He'll be fine. Tomorrow night.	4	4
Yankee pot roast.	4	4
Let's go. Caroline will be watching your desk.	4	4
Why don't you have to do this?	4	4
You don't have to do this. You're getting paid.	4	4
We're old and we're married. They don't want us.	4	4
But I use Pond's. I do.	4	4
Come on.	4	4
Girls, rind your places. Megan, help me with the curtains.	4	4
No matter how late I come, I'm always waiting for someone.	4	4
I had to wait until the girls left the ladies' room to change.	4	4
You could've used my office, but I don't have one.	4	4
-This isn't right. -I thought you wanted Faye, not Dr. Miller.	4	4
"Yes, but I told someone to leave the ""e"" off of Faye."	4	4
I like to be able to correct it in front of the girls. It makes them trust me.	4	4
Because your name is spelled wrong?	4	4
Because I'm obviously not that important. I don't need it.	4	4
I have to warn you there's lots of perfume.	4	4
There always is.	4	4
...why everyone has a nifty name tag.	4	4
Very well then. I suppose I'll work in Mr. Sterling's office.	4	4
He won't be coming.	4	4
As I said, my name is Faye.	4	4
I don't have a name tag.	4	4
I guess they forgot about me.	4	4
They got mine wrong. I'm Dotty.	4	4
I mean I'm not a dotty person. That's my name.	4	4
Hello, Dotty.	4	4
So, there's no reason to be anxious.	4	4
We have to enjoy the fact that we're all getting paid not to work for a little bit.	4	4
But don't worry, that's our little secret.	4	4
And I'd like you to think that this is just a bunch of your friends,	4	4
as if maybe this is a sorority or a bridal shower with tea.	4	4
Or just a bunch of us celebrating, say Allison 's birthday at my apartment.	4	4
You shouldn't be surprised, looking around the room,	4	4
that we're here to talk about beauty.	4	4
What are the things we all do to keep ourselves beautiful	4	4
or simply to enhance it?	4	4
Please pass a Danish.	4	4
You don't have to raise your hand. Anyone?	4	4
I can say it.	4	4
I have a routine.	4	4
I brush my hair 100 times just like I did when I was a little girl,	4	4
but of course only the night before I have it set.	4	4
-Very cute. -Can you imagine?	4	4
Your financial future's in the hands of a roomful of 22-year-old girls.	4	4
Not mine.	4	4
Okay. Sometimes I watch my weight.	4	4
No one's hungry?	4	4
I'd like a Danish.	4	4
I don't use Pond's, if that's what you're asking.	4	4
That's okay.	4	4
I'm of French extraction and my mother has beautiful skin.	4	4
She never washes her face.	4	4
She's not dirty. She uses water, but nothing else.	4	4
And you do what she does?	4	4
What does she do?	4	4
She stands at the sink	4	4
and she runs the water until it's just the perfect temperature, not too hot.	4	4
And she splashes it on her face and she pats her cheeks with her fingertips.	4	4
And she looks at herself?	4	4
Yes, she does.	4	4
She's amazing.	4	4
I sit at my vanity and I have this night cream, my boyfriend laughed at me.	4	4
What was so funny about it?	4	4
It was just, you know, one time.	4	4
At Christmas Eve we were staying up late and we were playing house, I guess.	4	4
You shouldn't do things for them. They don't appreciate it.	4	4
You don't think they appreciate you being beautiful?	4	4
We broke up a year ago.	4	4
Actually, I don't know what he noticed, but it wasn't me, I guess.	4	4
It's worse when they notice, sometimes.	4	4
Allison, please, continue.	4	4
It's nothing.	4	4
-Are you in there? -Yes.	4	4
I asked your girl to inform me of your arrival.	4	4
She's in that group.	4	4
Did you speak with Tom?	4	4
I'm sorry. It didn't happen. The opportunity passed.	4	4
Well, then we shall endeavor to recreate it. Perhaps lunch today?	4	4
I'm afraid Roger's already informed Pond's that this was attended to.	4	4
That's sloppy.	4	4
I have a lunch, but I'm seeing him tonight.	4	4
Damn it.	4	4
Lane.	4	4
I just found out I'm going to be a father.	4	4
Well, now, that should take the sting out of all of this.	4	4
I suppose.	4	4
I apologize.	4	4
That's the very best news.	4	4
Congratulations.	4	4
Thank you.	4	4
"And I just kept thinking, ""Why does he stare at other girls?"""	4	4
Well, men do that, but does he look at me that way?	4	4
And we're not married, so who am I?	4	4
How the hell did this get so sad so fast?	4	4
I know I'm speaking for everyone here.	4	4
But you can't think it has anything to do with how you look, Dotty.	4	4
You can only do your best with what God gave you.	4	4
What about makeup?	4	4
I feel like it doesn't matter what I see.	4	4
It matters what he sees.	4	4
I feel like I gave him everything and I got nothing.	4	4
I could see she was gonna crack.	4	4
Allison?	4	4
Are you all right, dear?	4	4
-It's okay. She'll be all right. -Should I...	4	4
If she wanted to be around us, she would've stayed.	4	4
Sarah, what do you do that makes you feel good about the way you look?	4	4
I feel kind of responsible. Do you mind?	4	4
Is there any kind of ritual?	4	4
I think my strategy was right.	4	4
They just wanna get married and they'll buy anything that'll help.	4	4
-Are you all right? -it's you.	4	4
Come with me.	4	4
People cry in these things all the time. Grown men.	4	4
I was in a bunch when I first started working here.	4	4
I'd say half the time somebody cries.	4	4
Really?	4	4
I think it just feels good to talk.	4	4
I can't even say anything because I know he's right out there,	4	4
right through the glass.	4	4
Who?	4	4
I don't know how you stand it.	4	4
The way he turns on the charm one minute and then yanks it away.	4	4
How can you even talk to him?	4	4
Don?	4	4
Would you stop it?	4	4
I realize you must've gone through everything I've gone through.	4	4
But now I know. It's just, he's a drunk.	4	4
And they get away with murder because they forget everything.	4	4
I don't know what you think.	4	4
Forget it.	4	4
Your problem is not my problem.	4	4
-Fine. -And honestly, you should get over it.	4	4
Please leave me alone.	4	4
-Thank you. Nice to meet you, too. -Nice to meet you.	4	4
-Bye. -Bye.	4	4
-Did she go home? -No, she's fine.	4	4
Nothing else good happened.	4	4
-Bye, now. -Okay, great.	4	4
Bye-bye.	4	4
That went very well.	4	4
You can stop the tape.	4	4
Is she okay?	4	4
-Who? -Yeah, she's fine.	4	4
All right. Let's talk preliminary results.	4	4
Is it all right if we put this back the way it goes?	4	4
We can go to my office.	4	4
Let's go in there.	4	4
That's big, big news.	4	4
If you need any baby crap, Jen and I have a closetful.	4	4
-Hello, fellows. -Good to see you, Kenny.	4	4
-Pete. -How are you, Ken?	4	4
-Mr. Crane. -Over here, Gil.	4	4
There's a phone call for you.	4	4
I've gotta get this. Those goniffs at CBS are screwing me again.	4	4
-Those what? -Order for me, Caesar salad, no dressing.	4	4
-You wanna take a look? -Sure.	4	4
Listen, I've gotta get this out of the way.	4	4
But I would appreciate it for the future	4	4
if you would not say shitty things about me behind my back.	4	4
What?	4	4
Come on. Are you gonna deny it and make it worse?	4	4
I don't know what you've heard, but it's not true.	4	4
You didn't call me an All-American idiot who fell into everything?	4	4
Whom did I supposedly say this to?	4	4
Does it matter?	4	4
Well, I'd like to defend myself.	4	4
I heard that you told your wife that I was driving the tractor	4	4
when the accident happened.	4	4
What? I don't think so.	4	4
What I probably said was that you were involved,	4	4
we all were, and that it was your account.	4	4
And Crane told me yesterday you said I was marrying for money.	4	4
I didn't say that. He did.	4	4
Well, he's like that, and everybody who knows him knows that.	4	4
But when you say it, and especially when it gets back to my fiancee,	4	4
Trudy knows her, you know, some garden club.	4	4
I was unaware of that.	4	4
Look, you know what?	4	4
I apologize. Mea culpa.	4	4
Textbook Harry.	4	4
You know what? He's buying lunch.	4	4
I don't really care. I'm just glad to be out of the office.	4	4
It is nice, especially without having to listen	4	4
to some client yammering about how dirty the city is.	4	4
How's it going?	4	4
I've been floating along laterally, but I don't know that it's a love affair.	4	4
-It's better than McCann. -What was that like?	4	4
Are you kidding me? it's the worst agency I've ever seen. The worst.	4	4
My mother was a nurse at the state hospital in Vermont	4	4
and that was the last time I saw so many retarded people in one building.	4	4
So, you're getting married. Congratulations.	4	4
It's all that really matters, right?	4	4
Actually, I have a bit of news of my own.	4	4
Trudy is with child.	4	4
Good for you. Good for you.	4	4
I'll be honest, I can't wait.	4	4
It's very good so far.	4	4
A new family, a new agency, has to be exciting.	4	4
Well, you know, wherever you do this job, you're doing this job.	4	4
I know you're all slaves to Draper over there,	4	4
but I'd rather be a slave to creative than some old fart.	4	4
Whoever pours the last drink gets all the credit	4	4
and you're spinning your wheels half the time.	4	4
Right now we're chasing Mountain Dew.	4	4
Supposedly we're going to turn it into Pepsi,	4	4
but the only reason Pepsi would do it is to make BBDO sweat.	4	4
This whole idea that we'd get the bigger company is a joke.	4	4
We'd just end up with a bunch of little pieces.	4	4
Well, the grass is always greener.	4	4
Who am I kidding? Look how lucky we are.	4	4
Another Campbell, that's just what the world needs.	4	4
-Can I come in? -It's your office.	4	4
Glad to see you're feeling better.	4	4
If you don't feel like working...	4	4
What?	4	4
I'm very embarrassed.	4	4
People cry in those groups all the time, Allison.	4	4
That's not what I'm embarrassed about.	4	4
This actually happened.	4	4
I know.	4	4
I know.	4	4
We made a mistake	4	4
and I feel like it's awkward and it's better for both of us if I move on.	4	4
I don't think that's necessary. We're both adults.	4	4
No, I really would feel better about it.	4	4
A friend of mine told me about a job at a magazine	4	4
and I thought that might be interesting, working for a woman.	4	4
Anyway, I...	4	4
I would appreciate it if you could write me a recommendation.	4	4
Absolutely. What would probably be even better	4	4
is if you type up whatever you want and I'll sign it.	4	4
What?	4	4
You've been sparkling in your duties.	4	4
Just put it on my stationery, put whatever you want and I'll sign it.	4	4
I don't say this easily, but you're not a good person.	4	4
Allison, hold on.	4	4
What's going on?	4	4
I'm gonna need a new secretary. And this cleaned up.	4	4
Would you be open to Allison returning in a couple of days?	4	4
-If that's what she wants. -Really?	4	4
No.	4	4
There's a Joyce Ramsay to see you at reception.	4	4
So, at this point you've read everything out here?	4	4
I don't even like magazines,	4	4
but I brought in a book and they told me it didn't look right.	4	4
Hi.	4	4
Do you want to come back and see my office?	4	4
Another time.	4	4
Listen, my friend the photographer, Mr. Reject, he's having a...	4	4
I don't even know what to call it, downtown.	4	4
Are you inviting me?	4	4
-Are you afraid of the subway? -Of course not.	4	4
Thanks, sweetheart.	4	4
Washington Market,	4	4
unless you have to work or have plans that are more interesting.	4	4
It starts at 9:00. I'll be there at 10:00.	4	4
She's kind of pretentious.	4	4
I know.	4	4
Darling, we're so excited.	4	4
Is that you, Peter?	4	4
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut from now on.	4	4
Well, hello there.	4	4
-How are you feeling? -A little behind.	4	4
Why don't you let me fix my father and you a drink	4	4
and you can show my mother what we have planned for the maid's room.	4	4
I'll make the drinks. I don't care.	4	4
No, why don't you show your mother the maid's room?	4	4
I don't know that I'm an expert.	4	4
Okay.	4	4
Come along, Mother.	4	4
We're a couple of lucky ducks, aren't we?	4	4
We are. Tom, let me ask you something.	4	4
-What are you having? -In a minute. Listen...	4	4
I know what you're gonna say.	4	4
You need a bigger apartment. I get it.	4	4
Every time you jump to conclusions, Tom, you make me respect you less.	4	4
-What? -LOOK.	4	4
You gave us Clearasil and we're extremely grateful,	4	4
but there's only so much business it's going to do.	4	4
Yeah, well, that's kind of in your hands, isn't it?	4	4
I'm done auditioning.	4	4
You gave us this under a certain pretext.	4	4
I've done well by you.	4	4
And the idea was if we do well by this account,	4	4
you'll give us a shot at the big one,	4	4
because right now I have bigger business than Clearasil.	4	4
Are you mad at me?	4	4
No.	4	4
Clearasil was conflicted out by a bigger company,	4	4
and I'm trying to build a business here.	4	4
Well, what do you want? Do you want the cough syrup?	4	4
I want all of it.	4	4
I want the formula 44 mixture, the cough drops, the inhaler, vaporub.	4	4
Who's doing a better job for you than I have?	4	4
Well, you've given me something to think about.	4	4
Really?	4	4
I think it's pretty simple. What can I get you?	4	4
Trudy, do we have any ice?	4	4
You son of a bitch.	4	4
Tom, you have to come see this.	4	4
Joyce!	4	4
I made it.	4	4
You look swellegant.	4	4
Okay.	4	4
Peggy works in the same building.	4	4
Sharon was one of Davey's models.	4	4
What did your mother say?	4	4
She doesn't know.	4	4
What is that?	4	4
He screws around with movies, too. He's not as good at it.	4	4
I can't believe how big this place is.	4	4
I think it was a sweatshop.	4	4
Is there beer or something? I thought I saw someone with a beer.	4	4
Jesus. I thought I needed a lot of attention.	4	4
Listen, I'm already high, but this is easier than finding a beer.	4	4
If you like it.	4	4
I love it.	4	4
I'm hungry.	4	4
I have a boyfriend.	4	4
He doesn't own your vagina.	4	4
No, but he's renting it.	4	4
This film is more interesting than I thought.	4	4
-it's rhythmic. -Yeah.	4	4
I thought I was gonna get to meet him.	4	4
Abe!	4	4
Where the hell's Kellogg?	4	4
Hey, Abe. Are you with Joyce?	4	4
Are you?	4	4
-I'm Peggy. -Peggy's a writer.	4	4
So am I. What do you write?	4	4
I'm a Copywriter.	4	4
But what do you write?	4	4
That is writing.	4	4
You're not working on something else?	4	4
Davey Kellogg, this is Peggy Olson.	4	4
-She wanted to meet you. -I'm Catholic.	4	4
So, you like it?	4	4
I don't think I'm supposed to.	4	4
I love your nudes. We're looking for photographers.	4	4
"-I'm glad I was here to see this. -Who's ""we""?"	4	4
I work at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Advertising.	4	4
Why would I ever do that?	4	4
So you can get paid to practice your art.	4	4
Art in advertising?	4	4
Why would anyone do that after Warhol?	4	4
Sorry, for somebody to sell their soul, they've got to have one.	4	4
It's a raid!	4	4
It's the NYPD.	4	4
Wait, wait.	4	4
-Hey, come on. Come on. -Nobody move!	4	4
You know, I've been arrested before.	4	4
For what?	4	4
I was writing about this boycott in Harlem and they wouldn't leave, so I didn't leave.	4	4
Wow! Did you go to jail?	4	4
No.	4	4
My sister came and got me.	4	4
I feel like I should kiss you.	4	4
Come on.	4	4
They chased everybody down the fire escape.	4	4
Are they beating people?	4	4
They took the film.	4	4
I should see this. It could be a story.	4	4
-How can I find you? -I know where she is.	4	4
Nice to see you, Ms. Blankenship.	4	4
I look forward to hearing that every day.	4	4
There's coffee and a roll on your desk and Mr. Sterling would like to see you.	4	4
Roger, he's here.	4	4
Could you get the others?	4	4
Blankenship? Boy!	4	4
Hello? Could you fetch Campbell and Pryce, Lane, Misters.	4	4
What did you do to make them take her out of mothballs?	4	4
She was working in Cooper's apartment.	4	4
Allison found a better opportunity.	4	4
Do you know he works without pants?	4	4
-Morning, Don. -Don.	4	4
Morning.	4	4
I'd like to say in front of this informal partners meeting	4	4
that I am in the midst of signing Vicks Chemical, the entire cough line.	4	4
It bills at around $6 million and they love television.	4	4
It's truly spectacular news.	4	4
Congratulations. How'd you swing that?	4	4
I guess as the president would say, I turned chicken shit into chicken salad.	4	4
I thought I'd kick Clearasil over to Geyer.	4	4
Anyone but Chaough.	4	4
We're taking Philip Coakmeyer and Tom Vogel to luncheon today.	4	4
Don't worry, we already checked it with your girl.	4	4
-Keep it up. -Thank you, Don.	4	4
Please reschedule Dr. Miller.	4	4
They're not really pornography, per se. They're just nudes.	4	4
They're like renaissance paintings.	4	4
The party sounds fun. We had nude models in school.	4	4
You know right away whoever has the best drawing is going to get her.	4	4
Did you know Malcolm X was shot last Sunday?	4	4
Yes, Peggy.	4	4
Well, did you know who he was?	4	4
You ever read the stuff between the ads?	4	4
A few of us are sending a bottle of champagne to the Campbells'.	4	4
I'll sign the card.	4	4
-I was hoping for a contribution. -No, thank you.	4	4
Trudy's pregnant?	4	4
I can't believe that guy's married to her.	4	4
I would get her so pregnant.	4	4
Hello.	4	4
Congratulations.	4	4
Yes.	4	4
A $6 million account should shut Lane up for a while.	4	4
No, I mean about the baby.	4	4
Yes. I guess that's news.	4	4
I just wanted to let you know how happy I am for you both.	4	4
Thank you.	4	4
Dr. Miller is here to see you. It's a she.	4	4
Send her in.	4	4
-What do you want? -Nothing. I moved the meeting.	4	4
Your secretary said you needed to see me immediately.	4	4
We're still working things out.	4	4
Well, I've done everything but finish the report.	4	4
How'd we do?	4	4
Well, it turns out the hypothesis was rejected.	4	4
I'd recommend a strategy that links Pond's Cold Cream to matrimony,	4	4
a veiled promise.	4	4
Hello, 1925.	4	4
I'm not gonna do that, so what are we gonna tell the client?	4	4
I can't change the truth.	4	4
How do you know that's the truth?	4	4
A new idea is something they don't know yet,	4	4
so of course it's not gonna come up as an option.	4	4
Put my campaign on IV for a year,	4	4
then hold your group again, maybe it'll show up.	4	4
"Well, I tried everything. I said, ""Routine."" I tried ""ritual."""	4	4
All they care about is a husband.	4	4
You were there. I'll show you the transcripts.	4	4
You can't tell how people are going to behave	4	4
based on how they have behaved.	4	4
Why are you being so hostile?	4	4
You think I've never had this argument before?	4	4
Because you go in there and you stick your finger in people's brains	4	4
and they just start talking... Just to be heard.	4	4
And you know what?	4	4
Not only does it have nothing to do with what I do, but it's nobody's business.	4	4
Well, you're the client.	4	4
That's right.	4	4
-Hello. -It's Joyce.	4	4
Lunch, five minutes.	4	4
Sure.	4	4
-Meet you in the lobby? -No, my friends want to see Megan.	4	4
-Pete, you remember Phil Coakmeyer. -A pleasure to see you again.	4	4
Shall we?	4	4
We're just waiting on Don.	4	4
Hi.	4	4
-You wanna join us? -I can't.	4	4
Did you get pears?	4	4
Did you get pears?	4	4
Did you get pears?	4	4
We'll discuss it inside.	4	4
Donald Draper's office.	4	5
In addition to the two major cough drop users, smokers and cold sufferers,	4	5
is another group that eats them as candy.	4	5
"The technical term is ""hypochondriacs."""	4	5
Donald Draper.	4	5
Donald Draper's office.	4	5
Hello?	4	5
You said not to buzz you all the time, but I don't know how else to do this.	4	5
You have a phone call.	4	5
You can buzz me for a phone call.	4	5
Things like coffee after I've said no, you don't have to ask again.	4	5
 You're always asleep in here.	4	5
Walter Hoffman from The Times. He's a reporter.	4	5
What's it regarding?	4	5
You want me to go ask?	4	5
I think we're done here.	4	5
New York Times.	4	5
This is Don.	4	5
Hi. it's Walter Hoffman from The New York Times.	4	5
I write the advertising column.	4	5
I know who you are. What can I do for you, Walter?	4	5
I just wanted to know if you'd heard	4	5
that Cutler Gleason and Chaough just signed Clearasil.	4	5
I don't keep track of accounts once we resign them.	4	5
I just think it's kind of interesting	4	5
 that first CGC takes the Jai Alai Association from you and now this.	4	5
-How do you explain it? -I don't think about it.	4	5
Well, I talked to Ted Chaough	4	5
"and he said, ""Every time Don Draper looks in his rearview mirror, he sees me."""	4	5
You have a partners' luncheon.	4	5
What's your point?	4	5
My point is do you have a response?	4	5
On the record?	4	5
Please.	4	5
I've never heard of him.	4	5
Anything else?	4	5
No. Have a good day.	4	5
This Selma thing is not going away.	4	5
You still don't think they need a civil rights law?	4	5
They got what they wanted. Why aren't they happy?	4	5
Because Lassie stays at the Waldorf and they can't.	4	5
Please tell me I missed everything.	4	5
I now call to order a meeting of the partners,	4	5
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. In attendance...	4	5
Everybody.	4	5
Very well then, Mr. Campbell.	4	5
Secor Laxative has finally agreed to produce a television commercial and test market it.	4	5
How'd you ease them into it? Must've had to loosen them up first.	4	5
We've had that client for 18 years, Roger.	4	5
Pete has other news.	4	5
A Deerfield chum of mine roped me into a dinner for the Asia Society,	4	5
the result of which was a series of interesting phone calls and one lunch	4	5
regarding the Honda Motorcycle Company.	4	5
They control over 50% of the US market.	4	5
I've seen them. They're cute.	4	5
They're miserable at Grey.	4	5
Well, 50% of the market, who wouldn't be?	4	5
"""Where's my other half?"""	4	5
They're taking meetings and as of 9:00 this morning, we're on the books.	4	5
Three million dollars in potential billings,	4	5
and they're venturing into automobiles as well.	4	5
When can you bring them in?	4	5
Listen, let me spare you the agony and the ecstasy	4	5
and tell you we are not doing business with them.	4	5
Excuse me?	4	5
Look, I don't expect you to understand this, because you were a little boy,	4	5
but I used to be a man with a lot of friends.	4	5
Then World War II came and they were all Killed by your new yellow buddies.	4	5
Look,	4	5
if Bernbach can do business with Volkswagen,	4	5
we can do business with anybody.	4	5
The war is over, Roger.	4	5
Why don't we just bring Dr. Lyle Evans in here?	4	5
That'll be enough of that.	4	5
Lucky Strike is great. Meeting adjourned.	4	5
We don't usually put new business to a vote, do we?	4	5
Does anyone really have a problem with this?	4	5
No. When can you bring them in?	4	5
Immediately, if possible. I don't want to lose our spot.	4	5
So far I've been advised to read The Chrysanthemum and the Sword.	4	5
From what I can tell, they have their own way of doing business.	4	5
Bert, I'm hoping you'll help us navigate these waters?	4	5
I'll prepare a few salient points. Keep Roger out of the loop.	4	5
Another rather exciting possibility.	4	5
Good work.	4	5
Joan, get everybody that book.	4	5
I at least want them to see it on people's desks.	4	5
Who the hell is Dr. Lyle Evans?	4	5
I have no idea.	4	5
The body of a 38-year-old Unitarian minister	4	5
was cremated within hours of his death last night.	4	5
He had been clubbed by white men who resented his coming to Selma	4	5
-to join negro civil rights demonstrations. -Come in.	4	5
-Hi. -Hi.	4	5
Sally?	4	5
Hello.	4	5
I brought my doctor kit.	4	5
Okay, I'm gonna go.	4	5
Enjoy yourself. Which one is it?	4	5
I mean, which restaurant, in case I need to reach you.	4	5
Benihana's.	4	5
You're going to see a girl, aren't you?	4	5
Yes, I am.	4	5
-What's her name? -Bethany.	4	5
I don't like that.	4	5
Well, you don't have to.	4	5
Bed by 9:00?	4	5
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.	4	5
Jesus. What did you do?	4	5
You look like a mongoloid.	4	5
-Is it that bad? -Bobby, go to bed.	4	5
Sally, get over here.	4	5
No.	4	5
Good night.	4	5
Come over here.	4	5
I'm not mad. Come on.	4	5
Your dad is gonna kill me.	4	5
He's actually gonna kill me.	4	5
You have short hair and Daddy likes it.	4	5
That doesn't matter.	4	5
You're not allowed to do this and you know that.	4	5
Are you and Daddy doing it?	4	5
What?	4	5
I know what it is.	4	5
I know that the man pees inside the woman.	4	5
Where did you hear that?	4	5
A girl at school.	4	5
You should talk to your mommy.	4	5
I don't want to.	4	5
You don't need to know right now, so stop changing the subject.	4	5
I'm sorry.	4	5
Do you understand I'm in worse trouble than you are?	4	5
I just wanted to look pretty.	4	5
Come on.	4	5
We're gonna try and fix this, okay?	4	5
You're not impressed.	4	5
-My hair smells like I've been frying chicken. -It does?	4	5
Stop it.	4	5
This place is very expensive.	4	5
That's not it. it's just not very intimate.	4	5
Three dates in five months? Don't think I don't know why.	4	5
If it isn't the inscrutable Don Draper.	4	5
Ted.	4	5
-This is my wife Nan. -This is my friend Bethany.	4	5
Ted Chaough.	4	5
-Don Draper. -Pleasure.	4	5
Pleasure.	4	5
We just booked Howard Moses to shoot Clearasil. Have you ever worked with him?	4	5
Not yet.	4	5
I thought I was clever, but it looks like you and I had the same idea.	4	5
What are you talking about?	4	5
What do you think? Honda?	4	5
You think the rest of these tourists are from J Walter Thompson?	4	5
I suppose it's possible.	4	5
Well, the good news is, I think it's gonna be between us.	4	5
The bad news is the best man's gonna win.	4	5
Enjoy your dinner.	4	5
-We will. -Nice to meet you.	4	5
-What are you doing, Ted? -My job.	4	5
-Who's he? -Some fly I keep swatting away.	4	5
They haven't done half of what we have.	4	5
The minute he declared himself the competition, suddenly we were equal.	4	5
Well, as far as I'm concerned, he's no competition at all.	4	5
Hello?	4	5
We're not gonna let this spoil our evening, are we?	4	5
No.	4	5
-Do you know how to use those? -Yes.	4	5
You think you could teach me?	4	5
-What time did they go to bed? -I'm really, really sorry.	4	5
-They still up? -No.	4	5
It's just, I was watching I V with Bobby and I turned around for a second	4	5
and Sally cut her hair.	4	5
What?	4	5
It's pretty bad.	4	5
I could've just left them alone.	4	5
-She was in the bathroom. I didn't know. -You're supposed to watch them.	4	5
Don't.	4	5
I finally got her to sleep.	4	5
Do you know the river of shit I'm gonna get from her mother?	4	5
I'm sorry about that. I tried to fix it,	4	5
but you'll probably need to take her to the beauty parlor.	4	5
Why the hell did she do that?	4	5
She probably wanted to look older like Hayley Mills.	4	5
I don't know. I really shouldn't.	4	5
Consider it severance.	4	5
-Look... -I don't want your advice, okay?	4	5
Good night.	4	5
It's probably the kids.	4	5
Hi, Mom.	4	5
-Did you have a nice time? -Yeah.	4	5
Take that hat off.	4	5
Let me explain, okay?	4	5
-What the hell happened to you? -Calm down.	4	5
-You cut her hair? -No.	4	5
I cut it. I'm sorry...	4	5
-Hey! -Betty.	4	5
It was an accident.	4	5
Jesus. Betts, is that necessary?	4	5
I'm really, really sorry.	4	5
Damn right you're sorry. Get up to your room.	4	5
-Hold on. -No, now.	4	5
It'll be okay.	4	5
Bobby, take your little brother outside and play.	4	5
You didn't have to hit her.	4	5
You're right, because it doesn't do anything!	4	5
You have picture day.	4	5
-And forget about your sleepover. -Kids do this.	4	5
-You never did this? -All I wanted was to have long hair.	4	5
In fact when my mother was mad at me, she would threaten to cut my hair.	4	5
-Where the hell were you? -Look, it just happened.	4	5
The sitter wasn't paying attention.	4	5
You know what? I don't want to know about your life.	4	5
You can't even watch them for a second. it's like leaving them with nobody.	4	5
Because you're so good with them?	4	5
Take her to the hairdresser.	4	5
Goodbye.	4	5
-Betty. -Henry, I don't want to hear it.	4	5
I want him dead!	4	5
You don't think I feel that?	4	5
I was divorced, Betty.	4	5
My weekends with Ellie were sacrosanct.	4	5
I probably paid for a building in playland and he couldn't take a night off?	4	5
And who knows who he had watching her? Some secretary, another whore?	4	5
But...	4	5
That's him, not Sally.	4	5
And little girls do do this, and not just ones from broken homes.	4	5
I know.	4	5
I was impulsive.	4	5
I'll apologize.	4	5
Having had a girl this age,	4	5
I can tell you that punishment will only make this worse.	4	5
So maybe, when you're apologizing,	4	5
you let her know she's going to go to the hairdresser	4	5
and she can go on her sleepover.	4	5
Reward her? Really?	4	5
Really.	4	5
You're soft, you know that?	4	5
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. May I help you?	4	5
There you are. The Honda meeting's today, and before you bite my head off,	4	5
I'm up to date on the protocol with the help of Cooper	4	5
and we don't have to do anything but avoid criticizing them or giving advice.	4	5
I ran into Ted Chaough.	4	5
How are they in this thing and how could you not know that?	4	5
This guy's drafting off of us.	4	5
For the record, it's JWT, CGC and us.	4	5
Now if you don't mind, I have to get some gifts wrapped	4	5
and get these chrysanthemums out of the building.	4	5
Apparently they symbolize death.	4	5
So much conflicting information.	4	5
Allow me to show you around.	4	5
Our offices are probably more modern than you've seen,	4	5
but that's the kind of company we are, forward-thinking.	4	5
This is what we call the creative lounge.	4	5
We can't tell you how it happens, but it does happen here.	4	5
This is too difficult.	4	5
Well, tell them something.	4	5
This is Joan Harris, our chief hostess.	4	5
I'd like you to meet Ichiro Kamura and Hachi Saito.	4	5
Nice to meet you. I hope no one's taken you to Benihana.	4	5
David Ogilvy.	4	5
I've got a very good list of steakhouses. Just ask.	4	5
Not very subtle, are they?	4	5
No, they are not.	4	5
We are most happily looking forward to presentation.	4	5
Not now, I hope.	4	5
We want more driver for motorcycle.	4	5
And we shall endeavor to make that happen.	4	5
And now that we are finished, please accept our modest gifts.	4	5
I cannot accept.	4	5
A small token.	4	5
No, thank you.	4	5
Please. You are our guests.	4	5
Thank you.	4	5
-Open it. -No.	4	5
Later, of course.	4	5
It's a cantaloupe.	4	5
Johnnie Walker Red.	4	5
Thank you very much.	4	5
Thank you.	4	5
I'm sorry.	4	5
I didn't know this meeting was happening.	4	5
Then again, I know how some people love surprises.	4	5
I apologize, gentlemen, but for some reason I was not informed.	4	5
In fact, someone set a long lunch for me with Randolph.	4	5
Well, it was last minute and now, unfortunately, drawn to a close.	4	5
I have to warn you they won't know it's over until you drop the big one.	4	5
Twice.	4	5
The meeting is not over.	4	5
We have yet to present the rules.	4	5
So now you're dictating terms.	4	5
Mr. Kamura, Mr. Saito, this is Roger Sterling.	4	5
And this is their translator, Akira Takahashi.	4	5
We give each firm $3,000	4	5
for a competitive presentation.	4	5
In this packet are the conditions for the competition.	4	5
We don't want any conditions. We want it to be unconditional.	4	5
Akira, go ahead, tell them what I said.	4	5
Roger, stop it. These men are our guests.	4	5
I know exactly who these men are.	4	5
You think you can just come in here and we'll fawn all over you?	4	5
We beat you and we'll beat you again.	4	5
And we don't want any of your Jap crap.	4	5
So, sayonara.	4	5
If you could only know my embarrassment.	4	5
His wife's very sick. He's been drinking a lot.	4	5
You have our rules.	4	5
We very much look forward to your presentation.	4	5
You don't get to kill this account.	4	5
You know how they are. Maybe it'll kill itself.	4	5
Enough.	4	5
I'm not even talking about money right now.	4	5
I'm talking about the kind of work you could do for those people.	4	5
Have you seen that motorcycle? They love design.	4	5
As long as my name's in that lobby, I get to choose whom I do business with.	4	5
And I've got a lot better reasons than you had with Jantzen.	4	5
Jantzen was over.	4	5
Well, I made a pledge to a lot of men you'll never meet	4	5
not to do business with them.	4	5
Christ on a cracker, where do you get off?	4	5
You know what? You weren't there. You weren't anywhere.	4	5
I'm sorry you can't understand.	4	5
It's been almost 20 years	4	5
and whether you like it or not, the world has moved on.	4	5
These are not the same people.	4	5
How could that be? I'm the same people!	4	5
You don't think I know what you're doing?	4	5
You're wrapping yourself in the flag	4	5
so you can keep me from bringing in an account	4	5
because you know that every chip I make, we become less dependent on Lucky Strike	4	5
and therefore less dependent on you.	4	5
-Why, you little shit! -Roger!	4	5
Get him out of here.	4	5
The rest of us are trying to build something.	4	5
He's right.	4	5
You know what to do.	4	5
Where would you hide a coin? You'd spend it, wouldn't you?	4	5
I do know where it is. I'll tell you.	4	5
-Then tell me. -I'll make a bargain with you.	4	5
Let these two go. Keep me. I'll tell you.	4	5
-Promise. -No.	4	5
Then no deal.	4	5
What if you won't tell me where that coin is?	4	5
I refuse to talk in this...	4	5
What are you doing?	4	5
Nothing.	4	5
Laura.	4	5
Someone else was here...	4	5
Go upstairs.	4	5
Hold Still. I'll get it.	4	5
What's the problem? Is she sick? I would've come and gotten her.	4	5
No. The slumber party ended early.	4	5
I'd like to speak to Betty.	4	5
Okay. Honey?	4	5
Is everything all right?	4	5
No, it's not.	4	5
Could you leave us alone for a moment?	4	5
I found Sally behaving inappropriately.	4	5
What'd she do?	4	5
She was in our den on the couch playing with herself.	4	5
What?	4	5
I don't know what goes on here,	4	5
but that kind of behavior is not allowed in my house	4	5
and certainly not in the presence of my daughter.	4	5
I am	4	5
very sorry for this behavior and so is Sally.	4	5
I would've done the same thing.	4	5
Well...	4	5
I'm sorry about that.	4	5
I should go.	4	5
What is wrong with you?	4	5
You don't do those things.	4	5
You don't do them in private and you especially don't do them in public.	4	5
You have nothing to say?	4	5
I didn't do anything.	4	5
Don't you dare lie to me or I'll cut your fingers off.	4	5
Go to bed. We'll deal with this in the morning.	4	5
What happened?	4	5
I'm mortified.	4	5
I'm so embarrassed.	4	5
What happened?	4	5
She caught Sally	4	5
playing with herself.	4	5
What's wrong with her? That woman will tell everyone.	4	5
Why is she doing this?	4	5
I told you if it got serious, there is a solution.	4	5
I don't want to do that, Henry.	4	5
It's one thing after another.	4	5
What's wrong with her?	4	5
Maybe it's time we let a professional answer that question.	4	5
Henry,	4	5
I went to a psychiatrist once.	4	5
What? why?	4	5
Because I was unhappy and I don't think it helps anything.	4	5
I hate to think how much worse it would have been for Eleanor without one.	4	5
They train them just for kids. We got ours from the school.	4	5
I'm saying this not because I'm so sure there's something wrong with her,	4	5
but I think this is very hard on you two.	4	5
-When did you go? -Years ago.	4	5
I was bored.	4	5
-Can we leave it at that? -Of course.	4	5
Miss Blankenship, any luck on that call to California?	4	5
I'm sorry. No answer	4	5
Misters Peters and Pryce to see you.	4	5
Send them in.	4	5
I think we're okay, but everything they do is inside out.	4	5
I got a call this morning from my contact there, Masao,	4	5
telling me that the meeting was a Margaret Dumont-sized disaster,	4	5
but then... Lane?	4	5
Then, nearly 20 minutes later, Masao called me and set a time for our presentation.	4	5
Look, there's probably a guy like Roger at every firm.	4	5
They've outgrown it and we haven't.	4	5
Roger has something to say.	4	5
Mn Cooper and Mn Sterling.	4	5
I realize that I should not, at this point, limit our potential clients in any way.	4	5
Next account, no matter what it is, you'll have my full support.	4	5
And?	4	5
Look, I know it's an old one and I have to let it go just for my health alone,	4	5
and, well, hell, it's over.	4	5
Your contrition wouldn't have gotten you out of this, but you're lucky.	4	5
They called us today and gave us an appointment anyway.	4	5
That means nothing.	4	5
-it's over. -No, Bert, I said we have a meeting.	4	5
It's most likely that they are expecting us to come in and resign.	4	5
How do you get there from here?	4	5
Have we received a gift?	4	5
-We should have gotten one yesterday. -I haven't.	4	5
Miss Blankenship, have I received any packages today?	4	5
Yes.	4	5
Could you bring it in, please?	4	5
"It says ""Don"" on it."	4	5
Give it to him.	4	5
"""Help me, Honda. Help. Help me, Honda. Love, Teddy Chaough."""	4	5
-So, there is no gift. -That's how they work.	4	5
They want us to go in there, bow down and beg them to chop our heads off	4	5
because we disgraced ourselves. How could you admire these animals?	4	5
Would you shut up? They're businessmen and you insulted them to their face.	4	5
I'm expecting a child.	4	5
Jai Alai, Clearasil, now Honda.	4	5
Chaough wins another one by default.	4	5
He's not going to win.	4	5
I'm not wasting that appointment.	4	5
We need to do something that will make them notice us. Fireworks.	4	5
-Do you have a campaign? -No.	4	5
But I will and we're gonna shoot a whole commercial for it.	4	5
Something outrageous, something graphic.	4	5
The rules limit us to boards and copy.	4	5
"It specifically says, ""No finished work."""	4	5
Because no one's ever won an account by breaking the rules?	4	5
Not with the Japanese.	4	5
You're trying to tell me if we put our backs into this thing,	4	5
we couldn't turn their heads?	4	5
Three thousand dollars is all we have.	4	5
That should buy about four seconds of your commercial.	4	5
You don't think it's worth going out of pocket?	4	5
What pocket?	4	5
A spec commercial will eat up our ability to pitch any more new business this year.	4	5
And it's only March.	4	5
I would be willing to risk bankrupting this place	4	5
if I didn't think we were already dead in the water.	4	5
But we are.	4	5
Come on, Bert.	4	5
Hello?	4	5
Am I catching you alone?	4	5
What do you want?	4	5
I prefer not to talk about this on the phone,	4	5
but it's our feeling that Sally needs to see a psychiatrist.	4	5
"""Our feeling."""	4	5
Why, because she cut her hair?	4	5
No, it's more serious this time,	4	5
and I'm telling you because I found someone through the school.	4	5
A children specialist.	4	5
What exactly did she do? She set the house on fire?	4	5
She was masturbating, Don, in front of a friend.	4	5
Does that seem normal to you?	4	5
Really?	4	5
Boy or girl?	4	5
Jesus. What's the difference?	4	5
The doctor needs to speak with us, individually of course.	4	5
So you've made up your mind. Why are you even calling me?	4	5
She's out of control. I thought you'd be concerned.	4	5
I am. I just don't know that she needs a doctor.	4	5
Can't you talk to her?	4	5
You think I want this? I don't know what else to do.	4	5
You know what kind of little girls do that?	4	5
Fast ones.	4	5
She's 10 years old.	4	5
Well, don't think she doesn't understand.	4	5
She understands a lot of things, thanks to you.	4	5
What?	4	5
I don't care what you do, but just don't do it with her there.	4	5
You brought another man into your bed, into her house.	4	5
You don't think she noticed that?	4	5
One man, Don. How many have you had in your bachelor pad?	4	5
That girl you had watching her? Who's she? I'm married.	4	5
Jesus. You ever hear yourself?	4	5
I'll give the information to your secretary.	4	5
-Perfect. -Good night.	4	5
Yes!	4	5
Have you seen these? I'm trying to figure out what makes it work.	4	5
I'm still wondering what makes you work.	4	5
Joan, Pete, Peggy.	4	5
Don't touch it. I want to see how long it goes.	4	5
What's wrong?	4	5
"""A man is shamed by being openly ridiculed and rejected."	4	5
"""It requires an audience."""	4	5
What is that? Fortune cookie?	4	5
It's from that book you were all supposed to read.	4	5
Apparently making a commercial for the Honda pitch would bankrupt us.	4	5
And it's against the rules.	4	5
Forget the rules for a second.	4	5
CGC is the same size as us.	4	5
So, if we can't afford to do anything, they can't afford to.	4	5
So everybody's bankrupt.	4	5
Chaough said he's in my rearview mirror.	4	5
Well, guess what?	4	5
I'm gonna make a left turn right off a cliff.	4	5
All I have to do is let Chaough think I'm making a commercial and he'll make one.	4	5
So what's our campaign?	4	5
We don't have a campaign. We're not doing anything.	4	5
He just needs to think we are.	4	5
So what? He's going to make a commercial.	4	5
What if it's fantastic? He'll win the account.	4	5
You let me worry about that.	4	5
I know she's the best rep there is, but she told me you were unavailable.	4	5
I am. Clearasil doesn't wrap until Friday night, but maybe you could push it.	4	5
It sounds interesting.	4	5
Well, Howard, I'm going to insist on your discretion at this point.	4	5
Of course.	4	5
It's going to be four to five days.	4	5
-Just a minute. -Could you get the door?	4	5
I'm sorry. I thought I'd put this in here.	4	5
Later.	4	5
-Sorry about that. -That's okay.	4	5
-You didn't see that. -No, of course not.	4	5
That's Draper, isn't it?	4	5
Yes.	4	5
Anyway, it's 12 scenes. One of them obviously has a crowd.	4	5
You'll need to figure out how to shoot on the Staten Island ferry,	4	5
to it and from it, and how you're going to close Fifth Avenue.	4	5
I'll be honest. I'd give anything to do this, but right now I'm too busy.	4	5
Anyway, you know I'd much rather shoot your Honda commercial.	4	5
I don't have one.	4	5
Why the hell did they call you in? They know I've got you booked.	4	5
How can they afford that?	4	5
Get that kid in here who worked for Draper.	4	5
Anticipation.	4	5
Suspense.	4	5
A Honda tears through a subway tunnel, the train nipping at its tire.	4	5
He keeps looking back, the train roaring at him.	4	5
He's wearing a racing helmet. And then you see him head up the steps.	4	5
-Can they do that? -Howard'll make them do that.	4	5
And then he gets out on the sidewalk, stops,	4	5
kicks down the kickstand, takes off the helmet,	4	5
and he is a she, California blonde.	4	5
Hands down, that's your best idea.	4	5
We'll bring a guy to the pitch in a racing helmet,	4	5
have him take it off, it's a sexy girl.	4	5
What?	4	5
We only have $3,000, we're not shooting shit.	4	5
How long did you work for Draper?	4	5
A little over two years.	4	5
When you were in a bake-off, he ever break the rules?	4	5
I don't know. He wouldn't have shared it with me,	4	5
but he definitely doesn't think the rules apply to him.	4	5
He once disappeared for a month.	4	5
Does he like to play games?	4	5
He's always thinking on the edges of where you are.	4	5
I don't know. He's a genius.	4	5
You ever talk that way about me?	4	5
You know what? Why don't you go work for your boyfriend? Get out.	4	5
"And give me 20 different words for ""pimples."" Out!"	4	5
Call Barbara about Howard here and contact the city of New York.	4	5
We need a subway.	4	5
How are you doing?	4	5
Excuse me. Can I help you?	4	5
-We're late. -No, you're not.	4	5
Closed set. Sorry.	4	5
You scared me.	4	5
Who are you feeding today?	4	5
World travelers, Samsonite.	4	5
This is like a coconut.	4	5
Be careful.	4	5
There was a trapeze artist.	4	5
He made more in an hour here than he makes in a week at the circus.	4	5
-Have you ever had this? Sake? -No.	4	5
I don't know how people drink the way you do around here.	4	5
I'd fall asleep.	4	5
So what's it like being a trapeze artist?	4	5
Or did you just ask him about his luggage?	4	5
It's good.	4	5
He was surprisingly modest.	4	5
His father does it better than him.	4	5
He actually said that?	4	5
Best part of my job.	4	5
You'd be surprised what people will say to an interested stranger.	4	5
Why does everybody need to talk about everything?	4	5
I don't know but they do.	4	5
And no matter what happens while they're talking, when they're done they feel better.	4	5
You have kids?	4	5
No.	4	5
What does your husband do?	4	5
I'm not married.	4	5
But you're wearing a... Are you divorced?	4	5
No.	4	5
This is just a stop sign.	4	5
I walk into a lot of offices and it's helped me avoid a lot of distracting conversations.	4	5
But you told me.	4	5
Do you have children?	4	5
I do.	4	5
Two boys and a girl, one-and-a-half, seven and 10.	4	5
I'm sure it must be hard to be apart.	4	5
I don't see them enough.	4	5
And when I do, I don't know what to do.	4	5
And when I drop them off I feel relieved.	4	5
And then I miss them.	4	5
I'm sorry.	4	5
It is not going well.	4	5
My ex-wife thinks my daughter needs a psychiatrist.	4	5
And I assume you're against that.	4	5
I don't know.	4	5
Well, I can't say there's any evidence to support this,	4	5
but I'm pretty sure that if you love her and she knows it, she'll be fine.	4	5
Well, thank you for the drink.	4	5
I should be going.	4	5
Fake dinner plans with your fake husband?	4	5
Good night.	4	5
Now from what you told me on the phone	4	5
this year has been quite eventful for your family.	4	5
I know it seems fast, but I felt children had no concept of time	4	5
and Henry's really taken to them.	4	5
He has a daughter and she's such an exceptional young woman.	4	5
If you choose to have Sally work with me, I'd like to meet her,	4	5
and then interview you and your ex-husband.	4	5
I doubt you'll ever meet him. That's his level of interest.	4	5
Is this most recent incident of the most concern for you?	4	5
Well, I know the divorce is mostly to blame,	4	5
but she's been different ever since my father died.	4	5
He lived with us briefly.	4	5
They were very close.	4	5
I wish he had met Henry. That's my husband.	4	5
They would've gotten along.	4	5
My mother... I don't know.	4	5
My goodness, if I had done what Sally did, my mother was very strict about it.	4	5
My brother, he saved his money and bought a nudist magazine and showed it to me.	4	5
And then, my mother found it and she nailed it to his bedroom door.	4	5
What about you?	4	5
I was private and mostly outgrew it.	4	5
I see.	4	5
-Dr. Keener... -Call me Dr. Edna. That's what the kids do.	4	5
Of course I know children do this. But not in public.	4	5
I feel like Sally did this to punish me somehow, for everything.	4	5
That must be a terrible feeling.	4	5
It is.	4	5
You have to believe me. I had to get divorced.	4	5
I felt it best for them to have some stability in their life	4	5
and in the end, she doesn't understand that it'll be better.	4	5
Sounds to me like it wouldn't be bad for you to talk to someone.	4	5
No. No, I'm okay.	4	5
Well, I think it'd be helpful if you and I were to meet once a month	4	5
just to keep up with Sally's progress.	4	5
Will you tell me what she talks about in here?	4	5
No.	4	5
And the other way around as well.	4	5
That's better.	4	5
So I think we should start at four days a week.	4	5
Let me go get my date book.	4	5
-Where's your film? -What film?	4	5
That's how you're shaking it? I heard it stunk.	4	5
We didn't make one. it's too expensive.	4	5
Well, then you're out of luck, Donny.	4	5
'Cause I sure wouldn't want to follow what I showed them	4	5
with a speech and a couple of posters.	4	5
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.	4	5
Donald Draper.	4	5
Where is Mr. Cooper and Mr. Campbell?	4	5
And Sterling?	4	5
They couldn't make it.	4	5
You created this set of rules to even the playing field.	4	5
"It says specifically, ""No finished work."""	4	5
I understand not everybody has observed this.	4	5
I don't really want to be a part of a competition like that	4	5
so I'm withdrawing us.	4	5
Thank you for thinking of us.	4	5
Good afternoon.	4	5
The voiceover announcer for Lucky has a severe case of chest congestion.	4	5
Get the boy wonder on it.	4	5
Greg, accounts?	4	5
No, Pete.	4	5
Have a drink. it'll make me look younger.	4	5
I'm not gonna watch you feel sorry for yourself.	4	5
I feel sorry for all of us.	4	5
Don's over there surrendering right now.	4	5
Would you stop?	4	5
There was a kid on the destroyer, PFC Brycen,	4	5
and he was an honest-to-goodness poet.	4	5
-And then during... -Roger, I don't want to hear it.	4	5
My husband's gonna be in uniform any day now.	4	5
But how do you think he's gonna feel	4	5
when one day some Pete Campbell goes to some Vietnamese doctor?	4	5
Since when is forgiveness a better quality than loyalty?	4	5
Roger, I know it was awful,	4	5
and I know it'll never seem like it was that long ago,	4	5
but you fought to make the world a safer place and you won and now it is.	4	5
You think so?	4	5
Really?	4	5
I have to.	4	5
-Anything else? -No.	4	5
Good afternoon. Your daughter's psychiatrist called.	4	5
Lower your voice, please.	4	5
Congratulations.	4	5
I just spoke with Mr. Saito.	4	5
It seems Honda was never going to leave Grey,	4	5
but of the three princes invited to meet the princess,	4	5
you were the most charming.	4	5
We're first in the door on their little car.	4	5
And CGC?	4	5
Out of the running.	4	5
We killed him.	4	5
That stunt you pulled was unseemly.	4	5
The only reason I let you continue was...	4	5
Let me?	4	5
Do you think Joan can rent stage space without talking to me?	4	5
I let you because I realized that our financial future	4	5
was related to Mr. Chaough's demise.	4	5
So what is it?	4	5
Are you thanking me or reprimanding me?	4	5
-Let's not pretend like this wasn't a big risk. -We're thanking you.	4	5
Send over what you have on the car.	4	5
It redlines at 9,500 RPM, but it only has 57 horsepower.	4	5
What?	4	5
It's a motorcycle with doors.	4	5
The nice thing is it has windows,	4	5
so you can see your brains spatter against it when it crashes.	4	5
They're working on it.	4	5
Cheers.	4	5
Hello, Sally.	4	5
I'm Dr. Edna.	4	5
Why don't you come inside?	4	5
"""Greyhound. The cure for the common bus."""	4	6
"""La-Z-Boy. The cure for the common chair."""	4	6
"""Budweiser. The cure for the common beer."""	4	6
"""Manufacturers Hanover Bank."	4	6
"""The cure for the common bank."""	4	6
"How about, ""Alka-Seltzer. The cure for the common cold""?"	4	6
"""The cure for the common cold"" is the idiom I'm playing off."	4	6
It's an idiom. Did you know that?	4	6
So other than your summer internship at Needham,	4	6
do you have any actual advertising experience?	4	6
"""The cure for the common chair,"" that's Roger's favorite."	4	6
 Roger Sterling.	4	6
He's the guy I shook hands with when I came in.	4	6
What did Roger think of this ad?	4	6
What, are you kidding me? Everybody loves that.	4	6
It's the opposite of what you expect. That's what I'm interested in.	4	6
Why is it in your book?	4	6
I've got a bunch of them in there. Marlboro Man, Maidenform.	4	6
I like to put in work that I admire.	4	6
Don't you ever tear things out of magazines?	4	6
Yes, but I don't put them in my book.	4	6
Well, you know what they say,	4	6
"""Aspiration's as good as perspiration."""	4	6
That's not how it goes.	4	6
Look, I'm a 24-year-old kid.	4	6
 I want to be in the ad game.	4	6
I know I've got a lot to learn, but I'm a hard worker.	4	6
I'd sweep up the floors around here.	4	6
I don't know if Roger told you that. He did talk to you, didn't he?	4	6
He did.	4	6
It was really a pleasure to meet you, Danny.	4	6
-I wish you the best of luck. -Best of luck in what?	4	6
-What do you mean? -You trailed off.	4	6
We'll let you know.	4	6
Do you know a good place to eat around here?	4	6
Tell my secretary you're hungry and see what she suggests.	4	6
I don't work for you.	4	6
Are we on Candid Camera?	4	6
I don't want to jump on his grave or anything,	4	6
but there's no way he's 24. I'm 25.	4	6
What's his connection to Roger?	4	6
Besides being delusional?	4	6
He's Jane Siegel's cousin.	4	6
It's a relief to see someone worse than me and really know it.	4	6
Don't get used to it.	4	6
Well, you know, I look at Glo-Coat and see how far everything's come.	4	6
You know, my work.	4	6
Glo-Coat.	4	6
You finish something, you find out everyone loves it	4	6
right around the time that it feels like someone else did it.	4	6
Is that your speech for the CLIOs?	4	6
They don't have speeches.	4	6
We're going to win.	4	6
Just because I got nominated	4	6
doesn't mean they're going to give me an award.	4	6
-Aren't you excited? -I try not to think about it.	4	6
Then you must be excited.	4	6
Well, it'd be good for the agency.	4	6
Grey doubled their value in five years and it was all based on awards.	4	6
You got anything on Vicks?	4	6
-Actually, it's Vick Chemical. -Answer the question.	4	6
We're very behind.	4	6
Your new art director has been waiting for synchronicity,	4	6
which involves me coming up with a bunch of ideas,	4	6
chasing him down and having him draw all of them and lose them.	4	6
He's your new art director, too, and you have a deadline.	4	6
And don't think you can spend Monday hiding behind corners	4	6
and trying not to make eye contact. I will find you.	4	6
I'm not the problem.	4	6
You are, because Stan is talented and more experienced.	4	6
You need to learn how to work with him, not the other way around.	4	6
Well, good luck this afternoon.	4	6
You're not supposed to say that.	4	6
Well, break a leg.	4	6
Charlie Chaplin was very lonely.	4	6
That Tramp, too much of a sad sack.	4	6
Laurel and Hardy, they were better, except Hardy was so mean to Laurel.	4	6
I hated that.	4	6
Why am I talking about silent movies?	4	6
I suppose as part of the chapter on your childhood?	4	6
That part of my book is getting bigger and bigger.	4	6
Why is that?	4	6
Who is it?	4	6
I thought I should come in and tell you this in person.	4	6
That kid, a very, very cute prank.	4	6
Caroline, to be continued.	4	6
That's a good idea.	4	6
I've been to the CLIOs before. We're gonna want to show up prepared.	4	6
His book,	4	6
it was filled with old ads.	4	6
Plagiarism, that's resourceful.	4	6
He had five originals, they were all the same thing.	4	6
I told him to be himself. That was pretty mean, I guess.	4	6
-So when does he start? -The first of never.	4	6
Well, you haven't been married for a while,	4	6
so you've probably forgotten how these transactions work.	4	6
If I don't hire Jane's cousin,	4	6
it's probably going to cost me a personal gift expenditure	4	6
of between $500 and $1,000.	4	6
-When are we leaving? -Right after Life Cereal.	4	6
To new business.	4	6
And victory at the Waldorf.	4	6
I mean it. You deserve it.	4	6
So, I can show you what's popular, what's unique,	4	6
and the only thing I ask is that you call me Don.	4	6
Well, Don, I can't say I know my furs that well.	4	6
I know my mother had a Chinchilla,	4	6
I was always on the verge of a romantic relationship with it.	4	6
-Is this for your mother? -I bet you never hear that.	4	6
I don't. Would you like to give me a price range?	4	6
That's an interesting question. I have a unique problem.	4	6
I need to spend a lot, but be careful not to spend too much.	4	6
Not a unique problem. And I don't want to be forward,	4	6
but can I assume this is some kind of an apology?	4	6
No, no, no, I know exactly how much that costs.	4	6
"This is, ""I'm getting to know you, but I don't want to scare you."""	4	6
I know what we're gonna do.	4	6
"So now it's ""we""?"	4	6
It's always the right size and nothing says mink like mink.	4	6
It's a nice way to ease into things,	4	6
and you can always come back for the rest of it.	4	6
How about we split the difference so they wear them to their waist?	4	6
It's the most popular this year.	4	6
That's a dumb question. Who does your work?	4	6
-I do. -Really?	4	6
Yeah. It's an interest of mine and they let me do it.	4	6
Look at that. Can I give you a call?	4	6
First of all, you need 20 of those. And second of all, no.	4	6
I just want you to call that number so I can give you	4	6
some very specific delivery instructions.	4	6
Of course, Mr. Sterling.	4	6
So what do I owe you?	4	6
I saw you leave the office with something under your arm.	4	6
You don't know what it is.	4	6
The guy in the elevator thought it was a hydrogen bomb.	4	6
It's a beautiful box.	4	6
Skip the radio play. Open it.	4	6
Roger, you shouldn't have.	4	6
-You like it? -I don't know what to say.	4	6
Try it on.	4	6
But first, take off the dress.	4	6
One gift at a time.	4	6
What is this, an owner's manual?	4	6
It's Noah's Ark.	4	6
It's out of line is what it is.	4	6
So?	4	6
I love it. it's perfect.	4	6
And I think it's a bit much.	4	6
If you don't kiss me after that, I'm gonna believe you.	4	6
When I Wear it, I'll think of everything that happened the night I got it.	4	6
Caroline! Get in here. I think I finally have a work story.	4	6
Joan! What's keeping them?	4	6
Life.	4	6
When do you have to leave for the CLIOs?	4	6
I was late for the Emmys last year.	4	6
Red Skelton gave my seat away.	4	6
I'll surmise, due to the usual nature of your stories,	4	6
that that's someone of note.	4	6
The good news is our friends at the cereal company	4	6
have been grounded in Philly due to wind.	4	6
What's good about that?	4	6
And the bad news is	4	6
we only have an hour before we're due at the CLIOs.	4	6
Sorry, kids. Game called on account of wind.	4	6
If it's all about a send-off, I'll have a 7&7.	4	6
You have legs. Don?	4	6
Make it simple, but significant.	4	6
It's Friday.	4	6
For all we know, they're going to turn around and go home	4	6
and we'll have to reschedule.	4	6
Is Joan going with you?	4	6
Yes. We only had four tickets.	4	6
There'll be a lot of other people's clients there.	4	6
-Thank you, Joan. -Peggy, anything?	4	6
I have work to do.	4	6
”We represent the majority of the people in Alabama	4	6
"""who hate niggerism, Catholicism,"	4	6
”Judaism and all the 'isms' in the whole world.”	4	6
So said Robert Creel of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.	4	6
Somebody got it to Goldwater.	4	6
Apparently he pissed blood.	4	6
"”...he needs our help. """	4	6
This again? Really?	4	6
Clara asked.	4	6
Clara asked to see your reel?	4	6
I just wanted to see that Klan one. He said it never aired.	4	6
Which makes it less impressive, Clara. Girls, do you mind?	4	6
Well, all the girls are gone. What do you want?	4	6
Are you going to use the KKK to sell cough drops?	4	6
It's better than waiting on you	4	6
to bring me something that'll get my juices flowing.	4	6
Should I get Megan back in here? Maybe she's not repressed.	4	6
Why's it so hard for you to accept that man's natural state is nude?	4	6
Because I'm civilized.	4	6
Because you're brainwashed by society into thinking it's dirty.	4	6
You take away all this crap and you'd see it's not.	4	6
It's natural and it's beautiful.	4	6
Have you been yelled at by Don yet?	4	6
"-I'm not scared of him. -So that's a ""No."""	4	6
He said Monday, and I'm not working this weekend.	4	6
Okay, okay. Jesus. Are you on the rag?	4	6
It'll get done. Let's go.	4	6
Well, I'd say you're lucky the Glo-Coat brass isn't here.	4	6
The minute you win they know the ad's arty, and then you're out of business.	4	6
Turns out there's almost 50 awards.	4	6
Let's say 10 minutes apiece, that's... Holy crap.	4	6
Roger, you remember Ned Elliot from K&E.	4	6
Of course. What are you in for?	4	6
New England Merchants Bank. Best local under $2,000.	4	6
Stop bragging, will you?	4	6
Good luck, Don.	4	6
Well, well, if it isn't Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm.	4	6
Leave any drinks for the rest of us?	4	6
Don Draper, Roger Sterling, this is Major-General Frank Alvin.	4	6
Roger, have you had the pleasure of meeting Ted Chaough?	4	6
Is that how you say it? C-H-A-O-U-G-H?	4	6
Hey, writers, how many extra vowels is that?	4	6
Let's head due south, General.	4	6
Boy, I hope this doesn't drag on like last year.	4	6
Oh, wait. You weren't here.	4	6
General Rufus T. Bullshit.	4	6
I've met that guy before.	4	6
-In the war? -No, in a commercial for Bay Rum.	4	6
Chao-guh-guh hired an actor to impress someone.	4	6
Last time I saw the General, he had a parrot on his shoulder.	4	6
That was not a business proposition.	4	6
You catch more flies with honey.	4	6
Great, actual flies.	4	6
Phillip, how are you?	4	6
-You remember Joan Harris. -Nice to see you.	4	6
Mr. Cosgrove, nice to see you again.	4	6
I'm surprised he would bring you over here.	4	6
You know, we miss Birds Eye more than we miss Kenny.	4	6
Well, that's why I wanted to say hello.	4	6
-I hear the old team's getting back together. -What team?	4	6
Phil, that's not a sure thing.	4	6
Well, I'll say this about Geyer, they don't have Don.	4	6
Take your seats, please.	4	6
Well, we should sit down. Good luck.	4	6
Judas priest. Are we merging with Geyer?	4	6
Talk to Lane.	4	6
Welcome to the Sixth Annual American Television Commercials Awards.	4	6
We 're here to honor creative excellence in advertising and design...	4	6
I just ran into Ken Cosgrove.	4	6
Don't talk to me right now.	4	6
And I do mean everything.	4	6
I don't know if it was that funny but thank you.	4	6
I have to tell you I am very impressed you got this gig.	4	6
Yes. Well, thank you for making it easier.	4	6
Wally, it's me.	4	6
You know, when I was coming up at Y&R, you were very inspiring.	4	6
Raymond Rubicam said you were a genius.	4	6
It's great to see you.	4	6
I mean, actually alive and everything.	4	6
Get your hands off me.	4	6
What's with the French service?	4	6
God! I miss working with that guy.	4	6
I feel like I've already won.	4	6
Well, i'm afraid that'll be the limit to the public speaking portion of our show.	4	6
And, gentlemen, let's pace ourselves.	4	6
In the first category, that of apparel, the nominees are...	4	6
That's five.	4	6
If you really worked on the Johnson campaign, why are you here?	4	6
Because nobody at DDB even keeps track of who does what,	4	6
except the daisy ad. Big deal.	4	6
The Klan is probably the best thing I'll be near my entire life.	4	6
Well, let me tell you, I had a lot to do with Glo-Coat. A lot.	4	6
The idea, especially.	4	6
The kid?	4	6
Don put the whole cowboy thing on it. I don't know if it was that revolutionary.	4	6
It was jarring, but more cute than I like.	4	6
I know I'm not supposed to go, but when the nomination came in,	4	6
Don let everybody pat him on the back.	4	6
He didn't even look at me and I was... I was right there.	4	6
And I was clapping and he thought I was clapping for him.	4	6
Who claps for themselves?	4	6
Okay, I'm gonna riff for a few minutes	4	6
and just sort of speechatize the whole Vicks experience.	4	6
Should I come back when you're through?	4	6
No, toots, grab a pencil.	4	6
Someone's gonna want to get it down before it heads into the Stratosphere.	4	6
Why don't you write down my ideas?	4	6
Look, I read your brochure.	4	6
I have no interest in the Temperance Movement.	4	6
-Congratulations. -Thank you.	4	6
This is Byrrh on the rocks.	4	6
Be the first on your block to serve Byrrh on the rocks.	4	6
And now for best Cleansers, waxes and polishes.	4	6
-This is us. -Glass wax sprays	4	6
"""Gobbles Up Dirt, "" Campbell Mithun of Minneapolis."	4	6
How do I look?	4	6
-Great. -One Step Floor Care's	4	6
"""Bus Stop, "" BBDO."	4	6
"Glo-Coat, ""Billy the Kid, ” Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce."	4	6
"And Pledge, ""Runaway Chain "" Benton and Bowles."	4	6
And the winner is	4	6
"Glo-Coat, ""Billy the Kid, """	4	6
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.	4	6
-Congratulations, Don. -Thank you.	4	6
-Next up, competing in the category of.. -Let me see it.	4	6
-Congratulations. -Thank you.	4	6
-What's going on, dear? -Well, I ran over	4	6
because the people from Life Cereal rented a car	4	6
and now they're waiting at the office.	4	6
-Right now? -We'll reschedule.	4	6
Maybe I can convince them to stay for the week.	4	6
No, no. They want to see our presentation.	4	6
What do you say we put a cherry on this thing?	4	6
-Aye aye, sir. -Really?	4	6
So the Schusters move into what used to be the Harrington house.	4	6
Meanwhile, Betty gets extremely jealous	4	6
when she sees Allison dancing with Rodney at the after-party.	4	6
But then Michael asked Betty to dance with him	4	6
and also dances with Claire	4	6
and that is all I can tell you about the next few weeks of Peyton Place.	4	6
-How the heck do you know all this? -They send me the scripts.	4	6
I need to see them. it's my job.	4	6
I can't believe Connie goes through with their wedding.	4	6
It is a surprise. I agree.	4	6
What more do I need to say?	4	6
-it's heavy. -Don, you remember...	4	6
Jim and Dennis, glad you could make it.	4	6
I can't thank you enough for waiting.	4	6
Don't think about it. We've been unwinding as Mr. Crane ruins Peyton Place for us.	4	6
Perfect. Let's get to it.	4	6
-Roger, thank you. -I'll be on my way, but first, victory lap!	4	6
Come on, Don, Pete, Crane, Jimmy Olsen!	4	6
Wrap it up quickly, gents. We have an after-party to attend.	4	6
Thank you, Roger.	4	6
-Is everyone set? -That's one word for it.	4	6
Joey, you didn't start without me, did you?	4	6
No, Don. I would not do that.	4	6
Okay, everybody ready?	4	6
So...	4	6
Life Cereal, delicious, crispy and it's got a big name, you know.	4	6
And I know you want to associate it with health,	4	6
but that's not fun. Joey?	4	6
You know what? I've got it.	4	6
Look, there are sweeter cereals than this,	4	6
but I kept thinking about, you know, nostalgia.	4	6
How you remember something in the past and it feels good, but it's a little bit painful,	4	6
like when you were a kid.	4	6
"-That's the truth. -And ""Life,"""	4	6
that's a scary word to anyone at any age.	4	6
So how do we make it fun?	4	6
"""Eat life by the bowlful."""	4	6
Little kid, big bowl, big spoon.	4	6
Kids see the giant bowl of cereal and they smile	4	6
because, you know, they'd eat a box of it if they could.	4	6
And moms see it and they get this twinge	4	6
of how little their kid still is, even though they have to deal with life.	4	6
Get those two together in a market and I think we're going to sell some cereal.	4	6
That's all I have.	4	6
I think if you'd invite us into the rest of your company,	4	6
we could build a Saturday morning TV show	4	6
around the whole Quaker Oats family.	4	6
In fact, it could be called The Quaker Oats Family.	4	6
I like the bowlful,	4	6
but I think it's kind of smart for regular folks, you Know?	4	6
The irony, I guess.	4	6
Children will get the picture. Moms will get the irony.	4	6
Yeah, but when I go back to Chicago, all they're gonna wanna hear is a slogan,	4	6
and I don't think this is gonna cut it.	4	6
Well, why don't we let Don work that over?	4	6
We can either talk on Monday if you're staying the weekend	4	6
or we can come see you in Chicago.	4	6
I've got it. I've got it, Pete.	4	6
How about	4	6
"""Life is just a bowl of Life Cereal."""	4	6
"""Life is sweet."""	4	6
"""Enjoy the rest of your Life Cereal."""	4	6
Don, they're not expecting you to do this right now.	4	6
Give me a second.	4	6
"""Life. The reason to get out of bed in the morning."""	4	6
"""Life. The cure for the common breakfast."""	4	6
"""Life. Its sweetness never ends."""	4	6
"-""Life. Eat it by the bowlful."" -There you go."	4	6
"""The cure for the common breakfast."""	4	6
-Love it. -It's got the health angle.	4	6
Life makes you feel better. It's got protein. Very nice.	4	6
That dog will hunt.	4	6
Wonderful. We'll get that put together for you.	4	6
-Should we discuss media? -I can keep going.	4	6
I think we've got a home run.	4	6
We don't need to take up any more of your time.	4	6
I Know you have some celebrating to do.	4	6
I don't know what to say.	4	6
This is the most fun I've ever had in New York.	4	6
Anytime, fellows.	4	6
Very good then.	4	6
Roger, I'm done! Let's go!	4	6
Can I speak with you a moment?	4	6
-Got anything on Vicks yet? -I really need to talk to you.	4	6
-You still have nothing? -The tagline...	4	6
Do you think I'm joking when I give you a deadline?	4	6
-You said Monday. -Ida, book a nice room with a lock on it	4	6
for Misters Olson and Rizzo. Bill it to Vicks.	4	6
-Don't come out until you have something. -Are you kidding?	4	6
Pete, we'll walk them out.	4	6
Do you want to pick a place or should I?	4	6
He wasn't serious. It's the weekend. We'll work in the office.	4	6
Do you want me to go chase him down to see if he's serious or not?	4	6
Go get Stanley.	4	6
-I need to speak with you. -Not now.	4	6
-Lane, may I? -Come in.	4	6
I'm only going to ask once. Are we merging with Geyer?	4	6
-No. -Really?	4	6
Well, I ran into Ken Cosgrove and Clarence Birdseye at the CLIOs.	4	6
It came to me that Mr. Cosgrove was unhappy	4	6
and that he and his choice clients would be a welcome addition to the firm.	4	6
Over my dead body.	4	6
I apologize. It was wrong of me not to consult you.	4	6
-I wasn't sure... -Wasn't sure about what?	4	6
Whether to go behind my back?	4	6
I'm a partner, damn it. I have the same status here as you.	4	6
You've never liked me.	4	6
You picked him over me to begin with	4	6
and now you expect me to work with him again?	4	6
Approval denied.	4	6
Roger Sterling is a child,	4	6
and frankly we can't have you pulling the cart all by yourself.	4	6
Ken is proven.	4	6
He's hungry, and he has accounts.	4	6
Birds Eye, a beverage called Mountain Dew	4	6
and Fillmore Auto Parts, which has entered the national arena.	4	6
He would more than pay for himself.	4	6
Does that put you at ease?	4	6
What would put me at ease	4	6
is you and Madame Defarge not plotting behind my back.	4	6
Still, I expect pragmatism from you.	4	6
We share that.	4	6
Mr. Cosgrove and I are having lunch on Monday.	4	6
If your tantrum has subsided, you're welcome to join us.	4	6
-I'm going home. -And on a personal note,	4	6
I'd like to add that I'm quite fond of you.	4	6
It pains me to hear you say otherwise.	4	6
Get that thing in here.	4	6
General.	4	6
You're not flying tonight, are you?	4	6
No, it's been years.	4	6
I bet. Name some aircraft for me.	4	6
-No. -No, wait. Who do you report to?	4	6
-The president. -Of what, William Morris?	4	6
You know, one of these decorations is for shutting up loudmouths.	4	6
It's a pleasure to meet you, General. Enjoy your evening.	4	6
-Don, congratulations. -Thank you.	4	6
You, too. We're the top of the heap.	4	6
-The heap of what? -I know they give out 50 a year,	4	6
but I've got to say, it doesn't get any sweeter than this.	4	6
Roger, buy Ned a drink.	4	6
There you are.	4	6
Your mom called. She's looking for us.	4	6
It was very nice meeting you.	4	6
-What are you doing? -Rescuing you.	4	6
From what? A business opportunity?	4	6
Did you see the part where I won?	4	6
No, but I heard about it.	4	6
They're gonna put your picture on a dartboard at Grey.	4	6
What's their problem?	4	6
Grey won. Everybody won.	4	6
That's not true.	4	6
And just think how you'd feel right now if you lost.	4	6
About the same, I suppose.	4	6
It doesn't make the work any better.	4	6
That's very healthy.	4	6
Award or no award, you're still Don Draper.	4	6
Whatever that means.	4	6
You're incredible.	4	6
You smell good.	4	6
Is that right?	4	6
What do you say we get out of here and really celebrate?	4	6
I think you're confusing a lot of things at once right now.	4	6
I'm very happy for you.	4	6
Are you calling to give him an update?	4	6
I'm calling him about something completely unrelated to you.	4	6
I Know you have a special relationship.	4	6
-What does that mean? -What?	4	6
Not that. Jesus! Of course not that.	4	6
Do you think he'd be caught dead with you? There's wallpaper more exciting.	4	6
But I know you're his favorite.	4	6
I bet he takes you hunting	4	6
and lets you carry the carcasses in your mouth.	4	6
Are you gonna work or just stare at pictures	4	6
of women who can't stare back?	4	6
You wouldn't understand, but this inspires me,	4	6
opens my mind with freedom.	4	6
So why aren't you a nudist?	4	6
You talk about it all the time.	4	6
Well, in a liberated environment, I would be.	4	6
In the presence of the Pope or say, you,	4	6
it's difficult.	4	6
You don't know anything about me.	4	6
I know you're ashamed of your body, or you should be, at least.	4	6
What are you doing?	4	6
You're lazy. And you have no ideas.	4	6
-Really? -Yeah. Let's go.	4	6
You're a fruitcake, you know that?	4	6
And you're chicken shit.	4	6
I can work like this. Let's get liberated.	4	6
Fantastic.	4	6
What are you waiting for?	4	6
Just...	4	6
Let's talk cough drops. What you got?	4	6
I'm thinking.	4	6
About what?	4	6
Don't flatter yourself. it's involuntary.	4	6
Maybe it was left over from the magazine.	4	6
Terrific.	4	6
Now I don't think it's that hard to convince people	4	6
that cough drops are medicine, especially when they taste like it, right?	4	6
So you're really gonna leave me alone with all these naked gold women?	4	6
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt.	4	6
You're not interrupting.	4	6
That man over there, I saw you talking before.	4	6
-Is that Don Draper? -Yes it is.	4	6
-Is he attached? -To that glass? Absolutely.	4	6
No.	4	6
He's pretty proud of himself.	4	6
Well, it's a big day for him.	4	6
It's a big day for all of us.	4	6
Especially you, okay?	4	6
Well, they don't seem to give awards for what I do.	4	6
And what is that?	4	6
Find guys like him.	4	6
You've crossed the border from lubricated to morose.	4	6
Good night.	4	6
Mr. Sterling.	4	6
-Do I know you? -it's Don.	4	6
Don Draper. Heller's Luxury Furs.	4	6
The fur guy.	4	6
-What are you doing here? -I have a meeting in the building.	4	6
I saw you standing here and I thought I'd say hello.	4	6
Really? Name one other company in this building.	4	6
I'm sorry. It's just...	4	6
I've left some messages for you.	4	6
And I've ignored them. That's my message for you.	4	6
I just wanted to know what you thought of my portfolio.	4	6
I threw it out with the box from the coat.	4	6
That was a bad idea.	4	6
Maybe it was a bad idea,	4	6
but weren't you trying to get a break once?	4	6
Where does your boss think you are right now?	4	6
He knows I want to do what you do.	4	6
And what do you think that is?	4	6
I think you're a very important man in a very important agency.	4	6
Maybe I am risking my job,	4	6
but I'd do anything to buy you a drink and hear anything you have to say.	4	6
It's 10:00 a.m.	4	6
"My mother always said, ""Be careful what you wish for,"	4	6
"""because you'll get it,"	4	6
"""and then people get jealous and try to take it away from you."""	4	6
I don't think that's how that goes.	4	6
You're an expert on everything, right?	4	6
And how can I hire you? You know too much about me.	4	6
You know I've been discreet.	4	6
Once you say that, you're not discreet anymore.	4	6
I got to get out of here before they open for lunch. This is embarrassing.	4	6
I'll buy you lunch.	4	6
I'm stuffed. I had a jar of olives.	4	6
And you're a great fur guy. I'm gonna need one of those.	4	6
Let me get you a cab.	4	6
You should go home.	4	6
So you use cough drops when you're sick in bed,	4	6
on a car trip, at the movies and in church.	4	6
Anything you'd like to add?	4	6
-What? -This pencil's a little dull.	4	6
Maybe I should dip that thing in some ink and write with it.	4	6
-Stop looking. -I thought it might make it go away.	4	6
You know what? Fine.	4	6
Are we getting dressed now?	4	6
You can do whatever you want. I don't care.	4	6
But you do.	4	6
Fine, you win.	4	6
Win what?	4	6
Win the prize for the smuggest bitch in the world.	4	6
I got to take a leak.	4	6
Hey, Rizzo! I'm hungry. Do you want anything?	4	6
What did you win for again?	4	6
Cake mixes and toppings.	4	6
I wrote the jingle.	4	6
Can you hum a few bars?	4	6
That sounds familiar.	4	6
Okay.	4	6
Hello.	4	6
So you finally decided to pick up the phone?	4	6
-Where the hell are you? -Who is this?	4	6
It's me. Where the hell are you? It's noon.	4	6
You were supposed to be here two hours ago.	4	6
The kids are sitting in the den watching TV,	4	6
waiting for someone who is obviously not coming.	4	6
I know you don't care that Henry and I were supposed to go	4	6
to a very important brunch,	4	6
but I can't get Carla anymore. She's in church.	4	6
-I'm coming on Sunday. -It is Sunday!	4	6
I'm really sorry, Betts. I'm under the weather.	4	6
Well, thank you for the notice, Don. Thanks a lot.	4	6
Is everything okay?	4	6
Yeah.	4	6
Everything's fine.	4	6
I can't believe we slept so long.	4	6
Is that yours?	4	6
No, it's yours.	4	6
I'm really sorry.	4	6
I have some things to do. I forgot about them.	4	6
You said you were gonna take my picture and you never did.	4	6
-When did I say that? -I don't know.	4	6
Somewhere around your third order of French Fries	4	6
after your sister left.	4	6
My sister?	4	6
Was that her on the phone?	4	6
-No. -Don't lie to me. it's okay, Dick.	4	6
Listen, I don't want to get in the middle of anything.	4	6
Look,	4	6
I'm really late.	4	6
-I should get ready. -Okay.	4	6
Do you mind?	4	6
I had a great time, Doris.	4	6
I'm really sorry I forgot I had plans.	4	6
All right. I'll see you around, I guess.	4	6
Are you okay?	4	6
I tried to call you Friday night,	4	6
and yesterday it rang and rang and today it's busy.	4	6
My phone's not working.	4	6
Can I come in?	4	6
What's the problem?	4	6
I know you don't want to hear this, but the Life Cereal tag you sold,	4	6
it was that kid's. Roger's idiot.	4	6
"""Eat Life by the bowlful""? We worked on that for weeks."	4	6
"No, ""The cure for the common breakfast."" You changed it in the meeting."	4	6
I don't think so.	4	6
I know I've gotten stuff stuck in my brain before	4	6
and you don't know where it's coming from.	4	6
It's that kid's.	4	6
-Are you sure? -Yes.	4	6
Call Life and tell them it's terrible	4	6
-and we changed our minds. -They loved it.	4	6
It's terrible.	4	6
Well, neither you nor the client was in a condition to notice.	4	6
Think of 10 more tags.	4	6
No. I've been working all weekend with that pig	4	6
in that stupid hotel room. I am tapped out.	4	6
What hotel room?	4	6
You have to bring him in right away.	4	6
Tomorrow. Fix it.	4	6
Shit.	4	6
Mr. Cosgrove is on his way over. I've added you to our reservation.	4	6
No. When he gets here bring him to the conference room.	4	6
...and he's coughing and everyone's staring at him,	4	6
including the priest, then he sucks on a Vicks.	4	6
It's good.	4	6
-it's pretty much how I pitched it. -That's true.	4	6
I only changed one little thing.	4	6
Good morning.	4	6
Call the Pen & Pencil, see if someone found my award.	4	6
What's the category?	4	6
Best actress. It's a CLIO.	4	6
Hey.	4	6
They told me to wait here.	4	6
Your little friend is waiting.	4	6
Listen, Danny,	4	6
I've been thinking about things and there was a slogan in your book,	4	6
"""The cure for the common"" something."	4	6
-Bus, beer, chair? Which one? -All of them.	4	6
I'm gonna give you $50 for the idea.	4	6
You liked it, huh?	4	6
What did I just say?	4	6
I'd like a job.	4	6
Fine, $100. It'll be freelance work. Do you know what that is?	4	6
Yeah, it's not a job.	4	6
I don't have to buy it.	4	6
I could just use it. Take the money.	4	6
I don't need money. I need a job.	4	6
You wouldn't even be in this room if you weren't related to Roger.	4	6
But I am. it's all I have.	4	6
That and my ideas.	4	6
This place is fantastic.	4	6
Lane, could you leave us, please?	4	6
Certainly.	4	6
I've given this a lot of thought.	4	6
Me, too.	4	6
If you're open to the direction and tenor of the business I'm doing here,	4	6
I think you'd be a great addition to my team.	4	6
The hell's that supposed to mean?	4	6
That things have changed in a permanent way.	4	6
I'd say nothing's changed.	4	6
Look, Ken, everyone here likes you,	4	6
but this is a small shop, and I need to know you can do as told.	4	6
So,	4	6
how are the wedding plans coming?	4	6
Peggy!	4	6
Take Danny over to Joan. He's starting next Monday.	4	6
Are you kidding?	4	6
You will not be sorry.	4	6
Go away.	4	6
Wait here.	4	6
I always liked chocolate ice cream, but my mother made us eat vanilla,	4	6
because it didn't stain anything.	4	6
-I hired Jane's cousin. -Really?	4	6
What changed your mind?	4	6
Couldn't live without him.	4	6
Well, one good turn deserves another.	4	6
You left it at the bar.	4	6
Too much celebrating, I guess.	4	6
Yeah, that happens.	4	6
I'll give it back if you just say one thing.	4	6
You couldn't have done it without me.	4	6
Did I not say that?	4	6
I was wrong.	4	6
Thank you.	4	6
Mr. Sterling.	4	6
-Good morning. -Jesus! Would you leave me alone?	4	6
You told me to come in.	4	6
-The hell I did. -You hired me.	4	6
What? When?	4	6
"Yesterday. You said, ""Welcome aboard."""	4	6
...Five, six, seven,	4	7
eight, nine, 10, 11.	4	7
That's two for the Campbells...	4	7
Where are these exactly?	4	7
It's a movie theater, no bad seats...	4	7
the Cosgroves,	4	7
and Joey, Stan, Danny... $10 each.	4	7
How come we have to pay	4	7
when everyone knows damn well they were free?	4	7
You're such a Jew.	4	7
Your friends in Hollywood know you talk that way?	4	7
 And let me tell you- you're the Jew,	4	7
trying to make 30 bucks on something you got for free.	4	7
25 on Clay by a knockout.	4	7
Liston is favored for a reason.	4	7
- Cassius Clay is scared. - Of what, pray tell?	4	7
He had an elevated heart rate before the last fight.	4	7
Who says that means you're scared?	4	7
It happens to me all the time. It runs in my family.	4	7
Liston has the weight. And he's never been knocked out.	4	7
Sonny's old.	4	7
He's experienced.	4	7
Don, I've got your ticket.	4	7
You want to put something down?	4	7
Stan's got a barber who makes book.	4	7
 Yeah, who do you like?	4	7
I was just saying	4	7
I think Clay'd make one hell of an adman.	4	7
You're right. Gimme 100 on Liston.	4	7
Joining us for a little pre-fight steak and cocktails	4	7
at the palm?	4	7
Absolutely. Samsonite team, in my office.	4	7
Listen, if it comes up with Jennifer,	4	7
I did pay for the seats.	4	7
Can you make a dinner reservation before the bout	4	7
for Mr. Sterling and me anywhere but the palm?	4	7
I don't know why everyone cares so much about it.	4	7
If I wanted to see two negroes fight,	4	7
I'd throw a dollar bill out my window.	4	7
I thought we were doing this at 9:00. It's 11:15.	4	7
I'm late, but you're not. Good work so far.	4	7
- Where do you want me? - Behind the desk is fine.	4	7
You're in a white studio, like in some limbo.	4	7
There's two no-name football players holding	4	7
an American tourister and a skyway	4	7
going against Mr. Joe Namath	4	7
and his defender, a sexy girl	4	7
holding a samsonite, and maybe a referee.	4	7
"So we hear ""hut hut, hike!"" Namath fades back."	4	7
"""Oh no, it's a blitz!""..."	4	7
punch in on Namath, he says something like...	4	7
"""The secret to victory on the road is samsonite."	4	7
I carry it because it's tough	4	7
"and no matter what comes at me, I know I'm protected."""	4	7
As they fall,	4	7
the competitors will bust open, clothing flying out.	4	7
Touchdown, samsonite!	4	7
"- ""I've got it, honey."" - ""You sure do, Joe."""	4	7
"""Samsonite... it's tough."""	4	7
Endorsements are lazy,	4	7
and I don't like Joe Namath.	4	7
He hasn't even played in a professional game yet.	4	7
He's very handsome.	4	7
And women don't buy suitcases.	4	7
Dr. faye says they do.	4	7
Could you leave us, please?	4	7
Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment	4	7
where you feel free to fail.	4	7
You wanted to go with Danny's idea.	4	7
Because it works...	4	7
"""only samsonite is tough."""	4	7
It's the execution that's the problem.	4	7
- Okay, should it be funny? - Actually funny?	4	7
Maybe. Funny like what I just saw? No.	4	7
- Hello. - You remembered my birthday.	4	7
Did you open my present?	4	7
I am. Hold on.	4	7
My goodness.	4	7
I'm finally doing what I should've done years ago.	4	7
Phillips-Olson- something probably,	4	7
but I'll need you. I want to form an agency	4	7
that specializes in women's products with you	4	7
as my creative director.	4	7
I don't know what to say.	4	7
But you're smiling, right?	4	7
I have some very- sort of a little under the table,	4	7
but very high-level talks with the people at tampax.	4	7
Peggy, it's tampax- 50% market share.	4	7
I mean they're really up there.	4	7
Plus that queer at belle jolie	4	7
has been barking up my tree.	4	7
Plus I have my European connections.	4	7
It sounds exciting.	4	7
The train's leaving the station, honey.	4	7
Get onboard.	4	7
Where am I calling you?	4	7
I'm in my office at home.	4	7
So you already told grey?	4	7
I'm not wasting my talents over there anymore.	4	7
Believe me, it was mutual.	4	7
Duck, did you lose your job?	4	7
Peggy, this is good.	4	7
I'm not gonna lie.	4	7
I was a little inspired by what Draper did.	4	7
Now I just need some accounts.	4	7
It's tough because, well...	4	7
it's tough to get a credit line.	4	7
So what do you have so far?	4	7
I know it's not a diamond necklace,	4	7
but I did spend some money on those cards.	4	7
And I appreciate the gesture.	4	7
It's just...	4	7
I don't know whether to take this seriously,	4	7
because I suspect you've been drinking.	4	7
Well, you're wrong.	4	7
I heard about the Clios.	4	7
I have to see you tonight.	4	7
I have plans.	4	7
What, with that Mark? He's another one.	4	7
Duck, you are a valuable account man.	4	7
You have a bright future.	4	7
You just need to go to one of those headhunters and...	4	7
- I need to see you, babe. - Don't do that.	4	7
Peg, I'm falling apart.	4	7
Don't you know you're the last thing	4	7
that made me feel good about myself?	4	7
Pull your hands out of your panties.	4	7
I can't talk right now....	4	7
I want to see you tonight.	4	7
You been farting in here?...	4	7
I have to go.	4	7
We're going to lunch.	4	7
I don't know if you could tell, but he hated it.	4	7
I was hating it too while we were doing it,	4	7
but not before. I'm not gonna lie.	4	7
So we're back to the drawing board. Still gotta eat.	4	7
Come on, it's your birthday.	4	7
We'll let you talk through lunch.	4	7
You got a call	4	7
while you were in the toilet to the direct line...	4	7
Stephanie from California,	4	7
no last name. She says it's urgent.	4	7
- Would you like me to place the call? - No, I've got it.	4	7
Bad news. Our night is ruined.	4	7
I took care of that.	4	7
The kids are going to the palm.	4	7
We are going anywhere else.	4	7
Well, the brotherhood of alcoholics anonymous...	4	7
Freddy and Cal Rutledge from Pond's...	4	7
will be joining us for dinner and the fight,	4	7
which means we'll have to	4	7
drink before dinner if we want to drink at all.	4	7
And then there's all the talk about drinking	4	7
where they start with the funny stories	4	7
and they end up crying.	4	7
Again.	4	7
15 months I've been waiting for this fight.	4	7
$300. Liston has to lose by unconsciousness.	4	7
- Get rid of 'em. - I can't.	4	7
- I should work on samsonite. - That's in two weeks.	4	7
I'm gonna be in Florida. Now this is your job too.	4	7
- Let's go. - I'm sorry. You can do that without me.	4	7
- Samsonite you can't. - Are you serious?	4	7
We can solve this problem with a flask.	4	7
No, I wouldn't be good company anyway.	4	7
That's never bothered me before.	4	7
I don't know what it is,	4	7
but I look at the side of your neck	4	7
and I wish I had one of those James Bond pens	4	7
so I could jam a dart in it.	4	7
James Bond likes to travel. He goes all over the world.	4	7
He goes underwater. He met a girl underwater.	4	7
I think this is a good place to stop.	4	7
See you tomorrow.	4	7
Oh, great.	4	7
I don't like sitting at my desk	4	7
and looking into a garbage dump.	4	7
Although I am paid less, I am still not a janitor.	4	7
Thank you, gentlemen.	4	7
Doing something special for your birthday?	4	7
Mark is taking me to dinner...	4	7
the forum of the twelve caesars.	4	7
- Ooh. - Yes.	4	7
- How old are you? - 26 today.	4	7
Well, you're doing all right, aren't you?	4	7
Well, hello.	4	7
- Did I hear it's your birthday? - It is.	4	7
- How are you feeling? - Well, of course my days are	4	7
spent sleeping and visiting the ladies' room,	4	7
although it's an incredible feeling	4	7
having this baby kick me.	4	7
Is it any different than living with Pete?	4	7
You're witty.	4	7
I always assumed that, but it turns out it's true.	4	7
Are you going to watch the fight?	4	7
Oh, yes. I've been watching boxing	4	7
since I was a little girl.	4	7
My father loves blood sport.	4	7
Mr. Draper's looking for you.	4	7
I'm sorry. I have to go.	4	7
Happy Birthday.	4	7
You know, 26 is still very young.	4	7
Have fun.	4	7
I want a rare steak and I want to see	4	7
those two men pound each other.	4	7
Cynthia's at the restaurant. We should go.	4	7
What about Jennifer?	4	7
Oh, don't go in there. Don't do it.	4	7
- She's dead. - Let's beat it before it's us.	4	7
- I was just on my way out. - Did you get California?	4	7
Do you want me to try before I depart?	4	7
There's a time difference, you know.	4	7
I do, but it goes the other way.	4	7
Good night, Mr. Draper.	4	7
Get in here.	4	7
Why don't you talk to Joan and get rid of her?	4	7
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed	4	7
and made sure that I got it.	4	7
So where are we on samsonite?	4	7
We'll have something to show you in the morning.	4	7
But the suspense is killing me.	4	7
Well, I kind of was on my way out.	4	7
Let me just see where we are.	4	7
I guess I've got a minute.	4	7
Okay. We thought that samsonite is	4	7
this very rare element, this mythical substance,	4	7
the hardest on earth- and we see an adventurer	4	7
leaping through a cave.	4	7
Is this a substance much like bullshit?	4	7
I thought we could drop one off the eiffel tower	4	7
with a countdown- like the moonshot...	4	7
and show how it doesn't break.	4	7
- But it would, wouldn't it? - Probably.	4	7
The government has prohibited us	4	7
from doing things like that, Peggy.	4	7
They feel that it is not in the public interest.	4	7
We have a thing with samson,	4	7
because he's strong... and his hair.	4	7
I gave you more responsibility	4	7
and you didn't do anything?	4	7
That you like. We did work... a lot.	4	7
I don't care if you work 10 seconds	4	7
if you bring me something I like.	4	7
We're going to do this right now.	4	7
Oh, I know you have plans.	4	7
You were going to call me from a bar with an idea?	4	7
Do you think elves do this?	4	7
You're just gonna change it anyway.	4	7
Excuse me?!	4	7
- This is Mark Kerney. - I am so sorry.	4	7
I got drawn into his web. It's gonna be a while.	4	7
A while like soon, or a while like I should cancel?	4	7
15 minutes? It shouldn't take too long.	4	7
- He's going to the boxing match. - He's going to Maine?	4	7
You can watch it on closed-circuit TV	4	7
in the movie theaters. We got tickets.	4	7
How come we didn't go?	4	7
Because we're having a romantic dinner for my birthday.	4	7
Well, did you tell him that?	4	7
Look, I'm the only one who can help him with this	4	7
and the sooner I get off the phone,	4	7
the sooner I can come.	4	7
Just hurry, will you?	4	7
She's gonna be a few minutes late.	4	7
A surprise on top of a surprise.	4	7
She works too hard.	4	7
"""The oysters of Hercules,"	4	7
"which you with sword shall carve."""	4	7
I saw a tray pass by. They look like hockey pucks.	4	7
$1.65. You should let Gerry get this.	4	7
Mom, don't cut the kid off at the knees.	4	7
Now what if an elephant either sits on	4	7
or steps on the suitcase?	4	7
How about a slow-moving airplane runs it over?	4	7
Do you like Cassius Clay?	4	7
- He's very handsome. - I don't think so.	4	7
You're not supposed to.	4	7
I remember my mother talking about nat king Cole in a way	4	7
that made my father throw out all his records.	4	7
He's got a big mouth.	4	7
"""I'm the greatest."" "" Not if you have to say it."""	4	7
Muhammad Ali.	4	7
Do you like the airplane?	4	7
Liston just goes about his business,	4	7
works methodically.	4	7
Clay will dance and talk,	4	7
throw a few until he's wiped out.	4	7
A bag under an airplane looks like	4	7
there's been an accident.	4	7
Three classes of suitcase...	4	7
featherweight, middleweight, heavyweight...	4	7
for whatever class you're in.	4	7
But how do you do that on TV?	4	7
- What's the story? - You don't like it?	4	7
No, I love it. That's great. That's what we should do.	4	7
Let it ring.	4	7
I'll say you're not here.	4	7
Hello? Oh hello, Roger.	4	7
No, he's not here.	4	7
I answer other people's phones all the time.	4	7
I'm going to count to three, then I'm gonna start saying	4	7
a lot of words you don't like, sweetheart.	4	7
- This should be good. - I'm begging you...	4	7
Get down here right away.	4	7
You think I'd rather be working?	4	7
Yeah, I do. Did you know	4	7
Freddy Rumsen collects Indian arrowheads?	4	7
Where are you?	4	7
There's a bar next to Keenes.	4	7
I've been sneaking off to fortify myself.	4	7
Tell 'em you're sick. Go home.	4	7
I am sick. I think I overdid it.	4	7
And they're self-so-righteous.	4	7
I never pissed my pants.	4	7
This guy Rutledge killed a man with a motorboat.	4	7
You know what gets you over something like that?	4	7
Drinking.	4	7
Still got your ticket.	4	7
It's an attractive offer.	4	7
Look out your window. Can you see me?	4	7
Good night, sweetheart.	4	7
Go ahead. I'll wait.	4	7
- Hello. - 15 minutes? It's almost an hour.	4	7
I'm so sorry. I'm gonna leave any minute.	4	7
Did you at least have something?	4	7
You have to get down here.	4	7
You have to get down here right away.	4	7
I can't just leave, okay?	4	7
But you have to, okay?	4	7
You know what? Just go to my apartment and wait for me.	4	7
We can eat there another time.	4	7
No, I don't want to do that.	4	7
- I'll make it worth your while. - Damn it, Peggy.	4	7
I've got your whole family here	4	7
for a surprise dinner, okay?	4	7
And the only way you can make it worse	4	7
is by not coming at all.	4	7
Oh, Mark.	4	7
I'm so sorry. I'm coming right now.	4	7
Thank you.	4	7
Well, so much for the surprise.	4	7
Okay, I'm going to leave if that's all right with you.	4	7
I'm not so sure about it.	4	7
I mean every time we get into this,	4	7
we abandon the toughness idea.	4	7
Maybe there's something to the elephant.	4	7
Do you want one?	4	7
I'm sorry. Do you have someplace to be?	4	7
Maybe tap your foot so I get the message.	4	7
I was supposed to be at dinner an hour ago.	4	7
It's my birthday, and I'm pretty sure	4	7
I ruined everything.	4	7
- Why the hell didn't you tell me? - I don't know.	4	7
Because I thought this would take a second.	4	7
So now I'm supposed to feel like crap?	4	7
Oh, I'm so sick that I ruined her birthday.	4	7
Do you know when my birthday is?	4	7
- I was your secretary! - Well, enjoy your evening!	4	7
By the way, you are 20-something years old.	4	7
It's time to get over birthdays.	4	7
Go ahead. I'll do it myself.	4	7
Yes, I'm that important.	4	7
So the fact that you're calling means	4	7
that you haven't left yet.	4	7
I'm not gonna be able to make it at all.	4	7
- Are you kidding me? - I'm sorry,	4	7
but no one asked you to do this.	4	7
You said you never had a surprise.	4	7
I can't believe you.	4	7
This is your mother speaking.	4	7
Hello, ma.	4	7
I just want you to know that we're all here...	4	7
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate...	4	7
and we're not leaving until you march in here.	4	7
I can't, okay? Could you put Mark on the phone?	4	7
He's crestfallen, you know?	4	7
- Mrs. Olson, it's okay. - It's not okay.	4	7
Now he's making excuses for you.	4	7
I don't know how many nice boys	4	7
you think are lining up for you.	4	7
You should be grateful. Okay, goodbye.	4	7
- Hello? - I'm sorry I ruined this	4	7
and I'm sorry you had to spend the evening	4	7
with my mother.	4	7
You know what? She's right.	4	7
Really? Then why don't you date her?	4	7
She's never even had a job.	4	7
How the hell are you mad at me?	4	7
Because you used my birthday to get in good	4	7
with a bunch of people who drive me crazy.	4	7
Should I have invited don? You never stand him up.	4	7
What's the point of doing anything nice for you?	4	7
Jesus. You even sound like my mother.	4	7
I'm already into this place for $40.	4	7
If you don't mind, I'm going to enjoy my dinner	4	7
and you enjoy your work.	4	7
The fact that you would stay there...	4	7
you know what?	4	7
- Forget it. - No. What?	4	7
You want to do this right now?	4	7
- Do what? - Fine.	4	7
It's been nice knowing you. Happy Birthday.	4	7
- So that's it? - Yup. Good night.	4	7
Hello?	4	7
It'll be fine.	4	7
Couples fight. Ask Gerry.	4	7
What's wrong? Elevator out?	4	7
I think I just broke up with Mark.	4	7
Oh. Really?...	4	7
I think so.	4	7
So go home.	4	7
Nope. I'm ready to work.	4	7
You win. Again.	4	7
You could've just told me it was your birthday.	4	7
Right, and there'd be no repercussions.	4	7
- So now this is my fault? - Well, it's not my fault	4	7
you don't have a family, friends or anywhere else to go.	4	7
Go. Go. Run to him like in the movies.	4	7
- You don't have to be here. - I do have to be here	4	7
because of some stupid idea from Danny	4	7
who you had to hire because you stole	4	7
his other stupid idea because you were drunk.	4	7
Don't get personal because you didn't do your work.	4	7
And by the way, I know it kills you,	4	7
"but guess what: There is no ""Danny's idea."""	4	7
Everything that comes in here belongs to the agency.	4	7
You mean you.	4	7
- As long as you still work here. - Is that a threat?	4	7
Because I've already taken somebody up	4	7
on one of those tonight.	4	7
- Relax. - You know what?	4	7
Here's a blank piece of paper.	4	7
Why don't you turn that into glo-coat?	4	7
Are you out of your mind?	4	7
You gave me 20 ideas	4	7
and I picked out one of them	4	7
that was a kernel that became that commercial.	4	7
- So you remember. - I do.	4	7
It was something about a cowboy. Congratulations.	4	7
No, it was something about a kid locked in a closet	4	7
because his mother was making him wait	4	7
for the floor to dry,	4	7
which is basically the whole commercial.	4	7
- It's a kernel. - Which you changed just enough	4	7
- so that it was yours. - I changed it into a commercial.	4	7
What, are we going to shoot him	4	7
in the dark in the closet?	4	7
That's the way it works.	4	7
There are no credits on commercials.	4	7
- But you got the clio! - It's your job!	4	7
I give you money, you give me ideas.	4	7
And you never say thank you.	4	7
That's what the money is for!	4	7
You're young. You will get your recognition.	4	7
And honestly, it is absolutely ridiculous	4	7
to be two years into your career and counting your ideas.	4	7
Everything to you is an opportunity.	4	7
And you should be thanking me every morning	4	7
when you wake up,	4	7
along with Jesus, for giving you another day!	4	7
Oh, come on.	4	7
I'm sorry about your boyfriend, okay?	4	7
May 25th. Ideas for samsonite.	4	7
Toughness means that......	4	7
Peggy, get in here.	4	7
- No. - Come on.	4	7
You have to come in here right now.	4	7
What do you want?	4	7
You have to hear this. Sit down.	4	7
Come on. Sit.	4	7
So this is tape #4	4	7
"of ""Sterling's gold,"" by Roger Sterling."	4	7
So where was I?	4	7
Burt Cooper hated me and I thought it was	4	7
because he thought I'd be an ally of my father,	4	7
but it turned out it was something to do	4	7
with my joie de vivre,	4	7
My romantic prowess...	4	7
See tape #3...	4	7
Including some time with the queen of perversions,	4	7
his secretary Ida Blankenship.	4	7
You know what? Don't use her name.	4	7
But it was all about him hating my very youth,	4	7
all because the poor guy had been cut down	4	7
in the height of his sexual prime	4	7
by an unnecessary orchiectomy.	4	7
Lyle Evans, M.D.	4	7
I think he had him killed.	4	7
Anyway, sometime in the summer of '48...	4	7
No, 1932...	4	7
No, 1939.	4	7
Why are you laughing?	4	7
It's like reading someone's diary.	4	7
Come on. Ida was a hellcat?	4	7
Cooper lost his balls?	4	7
Roger's writing a book?	4	7
I should go.	4	7
- Stay and visit. - I've got nothing to say.	4	7
- Sure you do. - No, it's personal.	4	7
We have personal conversations.	4	7
No, we don't, and I think you like it that way.	4	7
I know I do.	4	7
Suit yourself.	4	7
We're supposed to be staring at each other	4	7
over candlelight and he invites my mother?	4	7
He doesn't know me.	4	7
It's not my fault.	4	7
I guess I'm back to square one.	4	7
Single.	4	7
Well, as Danny would say,	4	7
there's no use crying over fish in the sea.	4	7
Mouse!	4	7
Over there!	4	7
- What are you doing? - Get the suitcase.	4	7
- Why? - I'm gonna seal it up in my nice samsonite	4	7
- and throw it off the roof. - Don't.	4	7
Come on. Every idea you have is some version of that.	4	7
Let's do it. Where'd you go, Mickey?	4	7
- I think it's a rat. - It's a mouse.	4	7
I grew up on a farm.	4	7
You know what?	4	7
There's a way out of this room we don't know about.	4	7
Are you okay?	4	7
I think that's yours.	4	7
It's probably Mark. I don't want to answer it.	4	7
It's still your birthday.	4	7
Let me get you dinner.	4	7
What's the most exciting thing about a suitcase?	4	7
Going somewhere.	4	7
The acropolis.	4	7
I'd like to go to Greece.	4	7
I heard all the good cooks stayed there.	4	7
I'd like to just go on a plane. I've never been.	4	7
- Is that right? - I've heard about it, obviously.	4	7
I've seen it in the movies.	4	7
It's an incredible idea... flying.	4	7
I remember on the way to Korea	4	7
they told us how many thousand feet in the air we were.	4	7
There was some other kid there...	4	7
more of a yokel than me, even...	4	7
"and he screamed, ""man wasn't meant to fly!"""	4	7
Cooper has no testicles?	4	7
Ick. I don't want water.	4	7
My uncle Max said he had a suitcase	4	7
that was always packed.	4	7
"He said, ""a man has to be ready to go at any moment."""	4	7
Jesus. Maybe it's a metaphor.	4	7
There's something to that idea.	4	7
I don't know.	4	7
I can't tell the difference anymore	4	7
between something that's good and something that's awful.	4	7
Well, they're very close.	4	7
But the best idea always wins	4	7
and you'll know it when you see it.	4	7
Keep banging your head against the wall	4	7
then it happens.	4	7
And then it's done.	4	7
Yes, ma'am.	4	7
Not like everything else in my life.	4	7
I mean, I know what I'm supposed to want,	4	7
but it just never feels right...	4	7
Or as important as anything in that office.	4	7
- I didn't know you were in Korea. - Very briefly.	4	7
Did you shoot anybody?	4	7
Nope. I saw some people get killed.	4	7
That's memorable.	4	7
My father died right in front of me...	4	7
Heart attack. I was 12.	4	7
- I'm sorry to hear that. - It was pretty violent.	4	7
The TV was on.	4	7
That's why I hate sports.	4	7
Nobody was around...	4	7
Saturday afternoon. My mother was shopping.	4	7
I saw my father die too.	4	7
He was kicked by a horse....	4	7
You're kidding.	4	7
- What about your mother? - I never knew her.	4	7
Why is there a dog in the Parthenon?	4	7
That is a roach. Let's go someplace darker.	4	7
I hate dating. I'm terrible at it.	4	7
You'll find someone.	4	7
You know you're cute as hell.	4	7
Men don't exactly stop and stare in the streets.	4	7
Do you want that?	4	7
That's not what you were supposed to say.	4	7
What do you care what I think?	4	7
Well, everybody thinks I slept with you	4	7
to get the job.	4	7
They joke about it,	4	7
like it's so funny	4	7
because the possibility was so remote.	4	7
It's not because you aren't attractive.	4	7
I have to keep rules about work.	4	7
I have to.	4	7
You're an attractive girl, Peggy.	4	7
Not as attractive as some of your other secretaries,	4	7
I guess.	4	7
You don't want to start giving me morality lessons,	4	7
do you?	4	7
People do things, right?	4	7
My mother thinks you were responsible,	4	7
because you were the only person	4	7
who visited me in the hospital.	4	7
Jesus. Really?	4	7
She hates you.	4	7
Do you know who it was?	4	7
Of course I do.	4	7
Do you ever think about it?	4	7
I try not to...	4	7
But then it comes up out of nowhere.	4	7
Playgrounds.	4	7
Get up!	4	7
Get up!	4	7
- Come on! Get up! - Get up!	4	7
- Come on, get up! - Get up.	4	7
- Come on. - Come on, get up!	4	7
Get up! Get up!	4	7
- Come on, get up! - Come on, get up!	4	7
Get up! Get up, bum!	4	7
- Come on. - It's a fix.	4	7
- The fix is in. - What happened?	4	7
- It's over. - Already? Who won?	4	7
- Clay. - Don't believe that for a second.	4	7
No one goes down like that.	4	7
That's what the man just said.	4	7
Some fight. I lost 100 bucks in two minutes.	4	7
Let's go back, pack up and go home.	4	7
Damn elevator's like a rocket.	4	7
I think I'm gonna be sick.	4	7
Are you okay?	4	7
Do you want any water?	4	7
What?	4	7
I have toothpaste and a toothbrush in my desk.	4	7
Peggy?...	4	7
- Peggy. - I'll be right back.	4	7
Peggy?	4	7
Duck?	4	7
What are you doing?	4	7
Leaving Draper a little present.	4	7
Don't! That's disgusting.	4	7
Would you let me concentrate?	4	7
This is Roger's office.	4	7
Now come one. Pull up your pants.	4	7
I'm not going anywhere	4	7
without you.	4	7
Baby. Baby, I need you so bad.	4	7
You wouldn't answer your phone	4	7
and your roommate said you were still at work.	4	7
Why didn't you answer the phone, Peewee?	4	7
What's going on?	4	7
Just go lay down.	4	7
You don't belong in here.	4	7
So, Peggy, I see you're not alone.	4	7
I guess when screwing me couldn't get you anything,	4	7
you had to go back to Draper.	4	7
- Duck, let's go. - No.	4	7
That's right. We were in love.	4	7
Turns out she's just another whore.	4	7
Hey!	4	7
Jesus! Would you stop?!	4	7
Stop it! You're both drunk!	4	7
You know, I killed 17 men at Okinawa.	4	7
Uncle.	4	7
What the hell is wrong with you?	4	7
You still think you're better than me?	4	7
Come on, Peggy. Let's go.	4	7
I got rid of him. Are you okay?	4	7
Yeah.	4	7
Are you?	4	7
I, uh... I never thought...	4	7
I'm so sorry. I...	4	7
you know what? I don't know why I was with him.	4	7
- It was a confusing time. - Stop.	4	7
You don't have to explain.	4	7
Can you get me a drink?	4	7
How long are you gonna go on like this?	4	7
I have to make a phone call	4	7
and I know it's going to be bad, okay?	4	7
Oh.	4	7
Do you want to be alone?	4	7
Just make me a drink.	4	7
Sorry if I embarrassed you.	4	7
- Hello. - It's me.	4	7
She's gone.	4	7
I know.	4	7
She wanted you to know.	4	7
I'm sorry I didn't call. I was...	4	7
did she want to talk to me?	4	7
You know, she wasn't really there.	4	7
I'm coming out.	4	7
I'll make the arrangements.	4	7
No need. She left her body to science.	4	7
She said that she wanted to go	4	7
to U.C.L.A. Medical school tuition-free.	4	7
Of course she did.	4	7
I'm coming out. I'll take care of the house.	4	7
I'd like to stay here if that's okay with you,	4	7
take some time off from school.	4	7
Of course. That's fine.	4	7
She's in a better place.	4	7
That's what they say.	4	7
It's late and it's been a long day.	4	7
Okay.	4	7
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.	4	7
Stephanie.	4	7
What happened?	4	7
Somebody very important to me died.	4	7
Who?	4	7
The only person in the world who really knew me.	4	7
That's not true.	4	7
You should go home.	4	7
You can come in late.	4	7
I'll be fine.	4	7
I'm so sorry.	4	7
Good night.	4	7
Drop and give me 20.	4	7
You asshole.	4	7
Get to work. It's 10:30, maggot.	4	7
- Oh. - Did you spend the night here?	4	7
- Yeah. - See the fight?	4	7
No.	4	7
90 seconds of boxing and three hours of analysis.	4	7
- And we still don't know who won. - Clay won.	4	7
Read the paper.	4	7
Come in.	4	7
You look fresh. Did you go home?	4	7
I spruced up. Come over here.	4	7
Look at this.	4	7
I think you have to know the photo.	4	7
It's on the front page of every paper. It's historic.	4	7
How do we know it's the tourister that got knocked out?	4	7
Because the slogan will say so.	4	7
How do you put it on TV? Are they animated?	4	7
Why are you shitting on this?	4	7
I'm tired.	4	7
It's good.	4	7
It's very good.	4	7
Give it to Joey... No, Stan...	4	7
Then go home, shower,	4	7
then come back and give me 10 tag lines.	4	7
Okay.	4	7
Open or closed?	4	7
Open.	4	7
They say as soon as you have to cut down on your drinking	4	8
you have a drinking problem.	4	8
My mind is a jumble.	4	8
I can't organize my thoughts	4	8
and typing feels like work.	4	8
I've never written more than 250 words,	4	8
not even in high school...	4	8
Five paragraphs, 50 words apiece.	4	8
God, I was lazy.	4	8
I should've finished high school.	4	8
Everything could have been different.	4	8
 Are you okay, sir?	4	8
Summer's coming.	4	8
I smelled it.	4	8
I kind of thought I smelled corn, which is impossible.	4	8
There it was again.	4	8
Perfume.	4	8
Morning, miss blankenship.	4	8
How was your surgery?	4	8
It was a nightmare...	4	8
The ether and the blindness...	4	8
And then I got the goggles.	4	8
So everything's good?	4	8
I'll tell you... I was blind	4	8
- and now I see. - Well, good.	4	8
 - If you need more time... - I'm fine, Roger.	4	8
I'm kidding around here.	4	8
My book's at home.	4	8
Can you give me the number for a Bethany van Nuys?	4	8
May... maybe lift it up and drop it down.	4	8
I'm stronger than you, but I'm not that strong.	4	8
Stop stop....	4	8
- He's right. - I feel like Margaret mead.	4	8
You know what, Harry? I think this is a show.	4	8
Okay, we're gonna do it.	4	8
Harry, get out of the way.	4	8
What is going on out here?	4	8
I don't know.	4	8
I got blockaded on my way back from the men's room.	4	8
Thank you, gentlemen....	4	8
- Everyone back to work. - It took my watch.	4	8
- What? - Ken was buying a Clark bar...	4	8
But it ate my change, and since	4	8
Danny's not here, we went to Peggy.	4	8
But it turns out Joey's got the smallest hands.	4	8
No, I said I had done it before.	4	8
Why don't you put another dime in the machine	4	8
- and pull again? - Do you really think we didn't try that?	4	8
- This thing is a bandit. - Yeah.	4	8
Cut it out!	4	8
Don't make me come out here again.	4	8
Sorry, mom.	4	8
Pardon?	4	8
Okay. Hey, it's over.	4	8
I'm trying to get my watch. What am I supposed to do?	4	8
Call the complaint number. Have an adult solve this problem.	4	8
What is going on out here?	4	8
I was in the midst of an extremely important telephone call.	4	8
Joan was just handing out demerits....	4	8
Joey, in my office.	4	8
- Oh. - Go easy on him.	4	8
A private spanking... just like my dre dream.	4	8
When did we get a vending machine?	4	8
I know you're a freelancer and you spend time in other offices,	4	8
but you should know this behavior is not tolerated here.	4	8
- Yes, ma'am. - I should let you know	4	8
there's a problem now between us.	4	8
Why are you always on my case?	4	8
Because you are particularly disrespectful.	4	8
No, I'm not. Stan'sse.	4	8
Maybe he's better at his job.	4	8
I'm glad you're amused.	4	8
You're so arrogant.	4	8
Me? What do you do around here	4	8
besides walking around like you're trying to get raped?	4	8
Excuse me?	4	8
I'm not some young girl off the bus.	4	8
I don't need some madam from a Shanghai	4	8
whorehouse to show me the ropes.	4	8
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in here.	4	8
Where the hell else would I be? This is my office.	4	8
And you all better stop cutting through here.	4	8
It's not a thoroughfare.	4	8
Take the extra steps. You could use them.	4	8
You're right.	4	8
Go ahead. I'm leaving anyway.	4	8
I'm sorry.	4	8
Oh no.	4	8
Oh, miss blankenship, good to see you.	4	8
I mean, nice to see you. I mean, welcome back.	4	8
- Let me help you with those. - Finally, someone offers.	4	8
I told you I can see with the glasses.	4	8
- I'm out of cigarettes. - I've got your liquor.	4	8
I only have two hands.	4	8
- I'm set. - And then you're not.	4	8
Take those back to the storeroom,	4	8
and while you're there get me some cigarettes.	4	8
Your wife called earlier.	4	8
- She's not my wife. - Mrs. Francis said to remind you	4	8
that you can't have the kids this weekend. It's very complicated.	4	8
It's Bobby's birthday party Sunday.	4	8
It's gene's birthday.	4	8
Did you want me to buy him or her a gift?	4	8
No.	4	8
What a pleasant surprise.	4	8
You don't mind that I'm home early, do you?	4	8
You said you didn't want watch me pack.	4	8
You don't even want to say goodbye.	4	8
I don't.	4	8
Joanie, it's basic training. I'll be back.	4	8
You said they use live ammunition.	4	8
Come on. Come in here.	4	8
Greg, that doesn't make everything better.	4	8
- It makes it worse. - It's eight weeks.	4	8
I'm gonna come back in uniform.	4	8
You know you'll like that.	4	8
What am I gonna do? Who am I gonna talk to?	4	8
Well, you'll talk to your friends at work.	4	8
Is this the way you want to spend this time, crying?	4	8
- I can't. - Mmm, sure you can.	4	8
Just pretend we're in some midtown hotel	4	8
and we both snuck away for the afternoon.	4	8
More and more every day about Vietnam.	4	8
I hope it's not another Korea.	4	8
I sound like a little girl,	4	8
writing down what happened today.	4	8
Sunday is gene's birthday party.	4	8
I know I can't go.	4	8
I keep thinking about him.	4	8
He was conceived in a moment of desperation	4	8
and born into a mess.	4	8
One,	4	8
climb mount Kilimanjaro...	4	8
Go anywhere in Africa, actually;	4	8
two, gain a modicum	4	8
of control over the way I feel.	4	8
I want to wake up	4	8
and I want to be that man.	4	8
Could you get that to el Jefe?	4	8
So mountain dew... everything kind of fell apart there.	4	8
- They don't like the work. - Too bad.	4	8
Well, somebody showed a couple of bottlers the work	4	8
and they don't like witches brewing things.	4	8
They don't like the occult in general.	4	8
And you told them it's their hillbilly working a still?	4	8
I did, but the fact remains	4	8
that in the world of sodie pop	4	8
Pepsi is the tail and the bottlers are the dog.	4	8
They just want us to change the drawing.	4	8
Except it's damaged goods.	4	8
They're never gonna want to see that board again.	4	8
- Start over. - I did it with Joey.	4	8
Do you want Stan to take over?	4	8
You're spreading me awful thin.	4	8
Do you want me to tell Joan to figure it out?	4	8
"""It""? You don't even know what ""it"" is."	4	8
Miss blankenship, get Joan in here.	4	8
She startles when you do that.	4	8
I had an uncle who was blind.	4	8
She's not blind. She's recovering from cataract surgery.	4	8
He would come in the room and he would say......	4	8
- What can I do for you? - A redo on mountain dew.	4	8
I want to make Joey full time for a couple of weeks.	4	8
I'd have to double-check on his availability,	4	8
but are you sure he's the right fit?	4	8
He did the first round. And we're redoing it.	4	8
It's more complicated than that.	4	8
Well, this may not be the time or	4	8
the place to bring this up but...	4	8
- What now? - ...I've been hearing complaints about him.	4	8
- Really? - He's not a gentleman with the girls.	4	8
Okay. One juicy story?	4	8
I'll protect those concerned	4	8
but it involves an extremely blue joke.	4	8
- When? - It doesn't matter.	4	8
Fine, you can tell it to me later.	4	8
Of course,	4	8
but I'm going to call in other books. There's too much to do.	4	8
- Are we done? - Sure.	4	8
Can you tell ray Charles to come in here and clean this up?	4	8
And as soon as you get to Hollywood,	4	8
you find out that that myth is...	4	8
Well, it had some truth to it.	4	8
There is instant fame.	4	8
"What's this have to do with ""Peyton place""?"	4	8
Well, we went down to the set	4	8
and Ryan was doing this scene against another rival...	4	8
I can't tell you who... and the guy was awful.	4	8
I start to hear him talk about a young fresh face,	4	8
wholesome but a little mischievous.	4	8
Am I crazy?	4	8
I don't understand. You want to be an actor?	4	8
Does that sound like me? That's you. You could do it.	4	8
I know the right people... maybe not the big screen,	4	8
but the small screen definitely.	4	8
I'm kind of down to earth.	4	8
You're so handsome. I showed them a picture.	4	8
How'd you get a picture?	4	8
I sent one of those polaroids from the	4	8
Christmas party to Bernie Kowalski.	4	8
Mr. crane, I hate to interrupt you,	4	8
but I have Peggy Olson out here looking for Mr. baird.	4	8
Well, thank you for thinking of me.	4	8
You're too modest, you know that?	4	8
What were you doing in there?	4	8
Everyplace I've worked there's always some old fairy	4	8
who comes onto me, but that was the weirdest by far.	4	8
Yes, everybody wants you, Joey.	4	8
- It happens a lot. - What did you do to Joan?	4	8
- I told her off. - Well, you shouldn't have.	4	8
- She's important around here. - Let me	4	8
tell you something about the big ragu.	4	8
We're creative and she's an overblown secretary.	4	8
Fine, don't listen to me.	4	8
There's a Joan in every company.	4	8
My mother was a Joan,	4	8
always telling everybody what to do.	4	8
She even wore a pen around her neck	4	8
so people would stare at her tits.	4	8
She's not your mother, and she and Lane basically run this place.	4	8
Okay, message received.	4	8
Ugh, is it time to go yet?	4	8
Glad you could make it.	4	8
Well, we were on our way to the theater anyway.	4	8
Ralph Stuben, this is my wife Betty.	4	8
- Pleased to meet you. - I hope you don't mind.	4	8
The Congressman wanted me to do this immediately	4	8
and he didn't want me to do it over the phone.	4	8
She doesn't mind,	4	8
and she's very discreet.	4	8
That's the curse of a political wife...	4	8
That and having to eat dinner with	4	8
a lot of people you don't know.	4	8
Betty's no stranger to public service.	4	8
- So what show did you see? - Why don't we get a drink at the bar?	4	8
It'll only be a minute.	4	8
Thank you.	4	8
So are you a Felix or an Oscar?	4	8
Like most men I'd rather be an Oscar,	4	8
but I'm probably a Felix....	4	8
Every date feels like a first date with you.	4	8
Is that good or bad?	4	8
It's just I know you must be seeing someone else.	4	8
And don't say no, because it'll just hurt me more.	4	8
Look, I'm here with you right now.	4	8
We're on a date	4	8
and I thought we were getting to know each other.	4	8
It doesn't just accumulate.	4	8
It takes intense, prolonged contact.	4	8
Don't you want to be close with anyone?	4	8
I do.	4	8
I know we're from different generations	4	8
but I'm going to need more from you.	4	8
We are from different generations,	4	8
because I don't remember women pushing this hard.	4	8
And I'm not seeing anyone.	4	8
I'm working...	4	8
All the time.	4	8
Well, I get excited when you call	4	8
and then I don't hear from you.	4	8
We don't have to get married for me	4	8
to show you off at the country club.	4	8
Don.	4	8
How are you?	4	8
I'm fine, Henry.	4	8
Henry, Betty, this is miss van Nuys.	4	8
- Bethany. - Enjoy your dinner.	4	8
My goodness, what was that?	4	8
Well, that was actually my ex-wife	4	8
and her husband	4	8
and some slob who's about to have the worst dinner of his life.	4	8
What? Her?	4	8
Well, first of all, my official capacity if anyone asks...	4	8
I'm here to thank you for securing	4	8
the governor's endorsement for Congressman Lindsay.	4	8
That's no small feat, I'm sure.	4	8
Well, rocky only hates him because he's handsome.	4	8
Well, not to worry.	4	8
Lindsay just wants to be Mayor.	4	8
Any talk of the white house is fiction.	4	8
"Huh. I guess he hasn't seen the cover of ""life."""	4	8
Okay.	4	8
Hypothetically,	4	8
the Congressman is putting together a team with his eye on '72	4	8
and well, it would be built...	4	8
If it were going to be built... around you.	4	8
And yes, he doesn't want rocky to have you either.	4	8
Elizabeth, do you know what you want?	4	8
Honey, this part is almost over.	4	8
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.	4	8
One drink and she gets flushed.	4	8
Yeah, my wife has the other problem.	4	8
Are you okay in there, ma'am? - Yes, I'm fine.	4	8
- You dropped your purse. - I'll take it.	4	8
What did you want me to do, put you in a cab?	4	8
That wouldn't be right.	4	8
I can't believe you made me sit there and look at them.	4	8
Nobody said you had to look at them.	4	8
You need a drink? Well, what are you, a wino?	4	8
You need a drink? That is not something you're allowed to say.	4	8
Oh, now you decide what I can and can't say?	4	8
I was in a marriage like that before.	4	8
You're gonna run into him. It's a small town.	4	8
- I hate him. - Hate's a strong word, Betty.	4	8
I hate Nazis.	4	8
I have an ex-wife. She bothers me.	4	8
I don't like seeing her. I don't hate her.	4	8
- You're a Saint. - I'm an adult.	4	8
It was upsetting. Can't you let me have that?	4	8
Not when it ruins the whole evening.	4	8
This man is asking me to take Lindsay all the way.	4	8
That could happen. Don draper doesn't have a say.	4	8
- You're right. Who cares about him? - You do.	4	8
He's taking up too much space in your life,	4	8
maybe in your heart.	4	8
That's ridiculous.	4	8
Look,	4	8
maybe we rushed into this.	4	8
"""We""?"	4	8
I was six months pregnant when we met.	4	8
- Pull over. - Are you kidding me?	4	8
Let me out, Henry.	4	8
No, you know what? Let me out at the house,	4	8
because you don't want to live there anyway.	4	8
You can stay at a hotel or wherever you were when I met you...	4	8
In your mansion with your servants.	4	8
Shut up, Betty. You're drunk.	4	8
What are you doing?	4	8
Making you comfortable.	4	8
She's a sweet girl	4	8
and she wants me to know her,	4	8
but I already do.	4	8
People tell you who they are, but we ignore it	4	8
because we want them to be who we want them to be.	4	8
To be continued.	4	8
I bet she was thinking of that line all night.	4	8
I looked up at the Barbizon	4	8
and I thought of all the women in there...	4	8
One in every room...	4	8
Touching themselves to sleep.	4	8
Waverly and 6th.	4	8
I like sleeping alone,	4	8
stretching out like a skydiver,	4	8
cool patches to roll onto.	4	8
I just appreciate it more.	4	8
No. No! I'm talking now!	4	8
I don't care where you go and I don't care what you do!	4	8
So in order...	4	8
Would you let me talk? I want my key back,	4	8
I don't want to see your shorts on my floor	4	8
and I don't want you complaining......	4	8
...That I don't cook 'cause I don't cook!	4	8
You know what, David? Go sitting in the ocean!	4	8
Good morning.	4	8
Are you leaving already?	4	8
Were you going to say goodbye?	4	8
I thought you could use the sleep.	4	8
I'm sorry, Henry.	4	8
Come over here.	4	8
I don't want to have to defend myself all the time.	4	8
All the time?	4	8
Henry, I'm really sorry.	4	8
I know.	4	8
Get some sleep.	4	8
Carla took the kids to school.	4	8
Henry, he was the only man I'd ever been with.	4	8
I'll call you later.	4	8
It tastes good, because it still	4	8
basically tastes like mountain dew.	4	8
And it's very simple to make. I call it jet fuel.	4	8
Rocket fuel, and I like the simplicity of the idea...	4	8
- Young people, hillbillies. - Xerox crapped out again.	4	8
I think I killed it.	4	8
I'll run this specimen over to the lab.	4	8
It's delicious.	4	8
Ah. You're a haircut, you know that?	4	8
You need three ingredients for a cocktail.	4	8
Vodka and mountain dew is an emergency.	4	8
Don wants our freelance art director Joey baird	4	8
put on full time for the next three weeks.	4	8
None of my business I suppose.	4	8
I really think this vending machine is a troublemaker.	4	8
I think it's been a great success.	4	8
Revenue is climbing.	4	8
I was gonna suggest we get a sandwich machine.	4	8
We'd probably get 40% of the work	4	8
force keeping busy through lunch.	4	8
Or we'd end up with a bunch of fat secretaries	4	8
who think the whole afternoon is lunchtime,	4	8
because there's always another sandwich around the corner.	4	8
There have been a lot of complaints.	4	8
Did you tell them to call the number?	4	8
What do you think they're doing in there... Lane and Joan?	4	8
It's an unholy alliance.	4	8
I know exactly what they're doing in there.	4	8
Joan's on the desk, boobs on the blotter.	4	8
Lane's behind her, probably has a bowler hat.	4	8
Am I wrong?	4	8
Hey, don't do that.	4	8
I'm not doing anything. Joan's doing it.	4	8
Mountain Dew-dah.	4	8
Give me three cocktails with at least three ingredients each.	4	8
Peggy Olson,	4	8
pioneering the science of wet blanketry.	4	8
You love her.	4	8
Holy Francis calling.	4	8
- This is Don. - Hello, Don. Henry Francis.	4	8
Sorry to bother you at work.	4	8
I assume it's important.	4	8
It is but not dire.	4	8
Okay. What can I do for you?	4	8
I bought a boat and I...	4	8
Well, I'd like to put it in the garage	4	8
and I don't have the clearance with your things there.	4	8
No, of course.	4	8
I can probably have some movers take them,	4	8
put them in storage somewhere. I can take it off the rent.	4	8
No. No, that's okay.	4	8
I should probably come and get them myself.	4	8
Gene's birthday party's on Sunday...	4	8
I know.	4	8
...So I think Saturday would be best, don't you?	4	8
I see.	4	8
The boat's coming next week so...	4	8
Fine.	4	8
I'll come at noon.	4	8
Miss blankenship, can I get some coffee?s	4	8
I just lost 30 in the machine.	4	8
How is that possible?	4	8
Well, I wanted a pack of life savers	4	8
so I put in a nickel and it didn't work.	4	8
So I looked in my purse and all I had was a quarter,	4	8
so then I lost a quarter too.	4	8
Was the exact-change light on?	4	8
I started with the exact change.	4	8
Oh, Peggy, it's a nickel.	4	8
I'm not calling that number. No one ever answers.	4	8
I can't believe you.	4	8
Fine, then give me some life savers.	4	8
- Who did that? - Did what?	4	8
That pornographic drawing.	4	8
It's a very brave person	4	8
that does something anonymously.	4	8
It's a very brave person who does that.	4	8
It's still illegal in many States you know.	4	8
I can't wait until next year when all of you are in Vietnam.	4	8
You will be pining for the day	4	8
when someone was trying to make your life easier.	4	8
And when you're over there,	4	8
you're in the jungle and they're shooting at you,	4	8
remember you're not dying for me, because I never liked you.	4	8
- Joan. - Don't worry. I'm not going home.	4	8
Jesus. Scorched earth.	4	8
- What's wrong with her? - I told you not to do that.	4	8
- Come on, Peggy. - It's a joke.	4	8
She's still patting around for the buzzer. I'm sorry.	4	8
What do you want?	4	8
Joey taped it to Joan's window.	4	8
- Really? - Yes, and it's disrespectful to Joan	4	8
and it's disrespectful to me.	4	8
Narrative, forced perspective... are you sure Joey did this?	4	8
Yes, I told him not to.	4	8
Well, I wouldn't tolerate that if I were you.	4	8
But you have no problem with it?	4	8
I didn't say that.	4	8
Look, Peggy, just go fire him.	4	8
Me?	4	8
I thought you would go out there and yell at him.	4	8
Yell at him, fire him. Look, believe me...	4	8
You do not want me involved in this.	4	8
People will think you're a tattletale.	4	8
Dr. Miller has arrived.	4	8
Send her in.	4	8
You want some respect? Go out there and get it for yourself.	4	8
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Have a seat.	4	8
Is everything all right?	4	8
Yes.	4	8
Joey, can I speak to you for a minute?	4	8
- You want one? - No.	4	8
I'm sorry, okay?	4	8
Good. Now go apologize.	4	8
What? Then she'll know I did it.	4	8
You did do it. I told you not to.	4	8
Come on. It's funny.	4	8
Really? Would you show it to Lane?	4	8
He would think it's funny.	4	8
What if it were Don on his knees?	4	8
You have no sense of humor.	4	8
You're fired.	4	8
All right, all right. I see the nostrils are flared.	4	8
- I'll go apologize. - No, get your things.	4	8
- Are you serious? - I am.	4	8
We'll see what Don has to say about that.	4	8
Don doesn't even know who you are.	4	8
I'm sorry it didn't work out.	4	8
Hang on. Come on. This is crazy.	4	8
It's just a job, Joey. You'll get another one.	4	8
Well, I was wrong about you.	4	8
What's going on?	4	8
Watch out, fellas. The fun's over.	4	8
- What? - That's all, folks.	4	8
- Are you serious? - A little bug bit me.	4	8
Well, I'll give you a call. We'll have a drink.	4	8
Stan, throw vick chemical on the back burner.	4	8
You're on mountain dew.	4	8
You know, these guys may be embarrassed	4	8
by having some professional tell them what to do.	4	8
He'll take advice from another man.	4	8
Not if he knows more.	4	8
You know I'm right about auto parts. I used to sell cars.	4	8
Yes, but we still have to do it.	4	8
God, this is boring.	4	8
I think I'm hungry. Do you want to eat?	4	8
- You mean order in? - I don't know.	4	8
You seem kind of dressed up.	4	8
We could take Fillmore parts with us if you want.	4	8
You'd like to have dinner with me?	4	8
Yes.	4	8
You asked me out the first time I came in here.	4	8
Why would it be different for me now?	4	8
It just felt like the timing is right.	4	8
So why don't we do that?	4	8
You could ask me out for dinner	4	8
at some future date instead of... I don't know...	4	8
Tacking it onto a workday like an afterthought....	4	8
I could do that.	4	8
Saturday night far enough in the future?	4	8
Not normally, but you're in luck.	4	8
Good.	4	8
Okay then.	4	8
I've got enough to go on here.	4	8
Okay.	4	8
It's Francine.	4	8
Come in.	4	8
Whoa. I'm all bitten up.	4	8
This is my potato salad bowl, but this one's yours.	4	8
Well, thank you.	4	8
Henry was going to pick one up on his way home from work,	4	8
but he's been so busy.	4	8
Oh, Betty, he's very ambitious.	4	8
He's mad at me.	4	8
Why would that be so?	4	8
Oh God, if I can make it through this weekend...	4	8
It's awo-year-old's birthday party,	4	8
you'll have help and no one cares.	4	8
Oh.	4	8
Is he coming?	4	8
I told him about it.	4	8
Now I can only hope he won't show up and ruin it.	4	8
Well, he won't.	4	8
We ran into him in the city...	4	8
On a date.	4	8
Bethany van Nuys... she was all of 15.	4	8
I misbehaved.	4	8
Henry didn't understand it for some reason.	4	8
Why do you let him bother you?	4	8
We see him walking out with the kids some weekends.	4	8
"- Carlton calls him ""that sad bastard."" - That's an act."	4	8
He's living the life, let me tell you.	4	8
He doesn't get to have this family and that.	4	8
Oh, Betty.	4	8
You have terrible luck with entertaining.	4	8
Just be careful.	4	8
Don has nothing to lose,	4	8
and you have everything.	4	8
I don't know if you heard, but I fired Joey.	4	8
I did. Good for you.	4	8
Excuse me?	4	8
Now everybody in the office will know	4	8
that you solved my problem and that you	4	8
must be really important, I guess.	4	8
What's wrong with you? I defended you.	4	8
You defended yourself.	4	8
Fine.	4	8
That cartoon was disgusting.	4	8
I had already handled it	4	8
and if I had wanted to go further,	4	8
one dinner with Mr. Kreutzer from Sugarberry ham	4	8
and Joey would've been off it and out of my hair.	4	8
So? It's the same result.	4	8
You want to be a big shot.	4	8
Well, no matter how powerful we get around here,	4	8
they can still just draw a cartoon.	4	8
So all you've done is proved to them	4	8
that I'm a meaningless secretary	4	8
have a nice weekend. Good night, Peggy.	4	8
When a man walks into a room,	4	8
he brings his whole life with him.	4	8
He has a million reasons for being anywhere.	4	8
Just ask him.	4	8
If you listen, he'll tell you how he got there,	4	8
how he forgot where he was going	4	8
and then he woke up.	4	8
If you listen, he'll tell you	4	8
about the time he thought he was an angel	4	8
or dreamt of being perfect.	4	8
And then he'll smile with wisdom,	4	8
content that he'd realized	4	8
the world isn't perfect.	4	8
We're flawed because we want so much more.	4	8
We're ruined	4	8
because we get these things	4	8
and wish for what we had.	4	8
- You smell nice. - So do you,	4	8
like chlorine.	4	8
I've been swimming.	4	8
Does it feel like summer?	4	8
It clears my head.	4	8
- For the creative process? - For something.	4	8
I've been a little out of sorts lately.	4	8
It's an effort to get in the water,	4	8
but when you do you're weightless and you don't even sweat.	4	8
And in the end,	4	8
you're wrung out.	4	8
I've been looking forward to this.	4	8
It's very hard to get a reservation here.	4	8
You should've called me. I know a guy.	4	8
Really?	4	8
Who's your guy?	4	8
My father.	4	8
A lot of people who supply restaurants	4	8
know a lot of the same people who know my father.	4	8
Like...?	4	8
Not my father, just his friends.	4	8
He owns a candy store	4	8
and there are certain responsibilities	4	8
that go along with that.	4	8
Interesting.	4	8
What's he like?	4	8
He's a handsome two-bit gangster like you.	4	8
Two glasses of chianti.	4	8
When I'm out of sorts, I look at the calendar.	4	8
There's usually something significant on the horizon.	4	8
I never noticed that.	4	8
It's my two-year-old's birthday,	4	8
but I'm not going.	4	8
Why not?	4	8
Because I'm not welcome there.	4	8
He thinks that man's his father.	4	8
Maybe that's okay.	4	8
All he knows of the world	4	8
is what you show him.	4	8
Oh, that's nice.	4	8
I know I've sometimes behaved to the contrary,	4	8
but I do admire your work.	4	8
That's nice to hear.	4	8
So tell me a trade secret.	4	8
How do you get them to do what you want them to do?	4	8
Aesop has a fable about the wind and the sun.	4	8
The wind and the sun had this competition	4	8
to see if they could get a traveler's coat off.	4	8
So the wind blows fiercely on him,	4	8
but the traveler just pulls his coat tighter.	4	8
But the sun shines down on him,	4	8
warmer and warmer,	4	8
and the traveler just	4	8
takes it off.	4	8
And the moral is?	4	8
Kindness, gentleness and persuasion win	4	8
where force fails.	4	8
You know, Aesop did that in probably 10 lines.	4	8
He's very economical.	4	8
So what you're saying is you want my coat.	4	8
72nd and Broadway.	4	8
Thank you.	4	8
Where do you live?	4	8
Only around the corner.	4	8
Really?	4	8
Yes.	4	8
But I'm just going to take you to your door.	4	8
And why is that?	4	8
Because that's as far as I can go right now	4	8
and I'm not ready to say good night.	4	8
That's not what I expected.	4	8
- Hello, Francine. - Hello, Don.	4	8
Daddy!	4	8
What's he doing here?	4	8
It's okay.	4	8
Here you go. Say hi to daddy.	4	8
Happy Birthday.	4	8
We have everything.	4	8
I'm interested in today. That was Friday.	4	9
Look, I'll clear lunch plus one hour	4	9
and we'll grab a sandwich and discuss this face to face.	4	9
I'm hanging up.	4	9
Is it broken?	4	9
The lamp?	4	9
What are you doing all the way over there?	4	9
It's too hot.	4	9
Would you settle for a leg?	4	9
I'd be grateful.	4	9
It's cold and soft.	4	9
 I'm the softest.	4	9
So which one of us is gonna look at the clock first?	4	9
I caught it when I was picking up the lamp.	4	9
I'm already late.	4	9
For what?	4	9
Secor Laxatives.	4	9
Did I spoil the mood?	4	9
What do you have to do?	4	9
I have a 4:00 at Erwin, Wasey.	4	9
Doing what?	4	9
I can't tell you that, Mr. Bond.	4	9
I told you.	4	9
What are you working on over there?	4	9
I don't tell them what I'm doing for you.	4	9
 But you're not lying in bed with them right now either.	4	9
Do you know what a Chinese wall is?	4	9
I really should go.	4	9
Can I get in the bathroom first?	4	9
Just take your time.	4	9
Let yourself out.	4	9
Lock the door behind you, as a courtesy.	4	9
You wanna leave me here?	4	9
You sure?	4	9
I'm taking everything interesting with me.	4	9
I don't understand. Do you honestly think my book isn't better than Ogilvy's?	4	9
Mine's got a story. It's got mystery, intrigue, romance.	4	9
I tell you what else it's got. It's got examples of how to sell things.	4	9
Hold on.	4	9
I'm on the phone.	4	9
It's Mrs. Sterling. She's leaving for the weekend.	4	9
It's only Wednesday, and they have phones in Southampton.	4	9
Ira, I don't want to sound ungrateful. I just think...	4	9
Hello? Hello?	4	9
Oh, shit.	4	9
Come in.	4	9
These need signatures, not initials.	4	9
Caroline said you refused?	4	9
It's just so much more work.	4	9
I was just giving her a hard time.	4	9
Can I interest you in the same?	4	9
And I'm supposed to tell you in person that Mr. Pryce will be taking off	4	9
the last two weeks of August for his son's visit.	4	9
You had to tell me that in person?	4	9
-So depressing. -He doesn't want a memo circulating.	4	9
He's afraid people will stop working.	4	9
What are you doing in August?	4	9
I'm not sure.	4	9
Well, what are you doing this afternoon?	4	9
The same thing I do every afternoon, working,	4	9
which is what I'm trying to do right now.	4	9
It's not cute.	4	9
Jeanie.	4	9
Jesus. I'm sorry.	4	9
What did you say to her?	4	9
What does that have to do with you?	4	9
Her husband got called up.	4	9
He's going to Vietnam right after basic.	4	9
Vietnam.	4	9
That's not good.	4	9
It's okay. We've all been walking on eggshells.	4	9
Good afternoon, all.	4	9
I know you don't like to be bombarded the moment you walk in,	4	9
but Fillmore and Secor are both coming in tomorrow.	4	9
I can't move forward with either until you sign off	4	9
on what I worked through lunch to finish.	4	9
I'm sorry. I had a long lunch, went for a swim.	4	9
Come back in an hour. I'm taking a nap.	4	9
It's a business of sadists and masochists, and you know which one you are.	4	9
-Hi. -Peggy, your boyfriend's here.	4	9
Satisfaction guaranteed.	4	9
-Why are you here? -Thought we could get a drink,	4	9
-shoot the bull. -Sure. What time? Where?	4	9
When you're alone And life is making you lonely	4	9
You can always go	4	9
7:00, P.J. Clarke's.	4	9
Midtown	4	9
I'll meet you in the lobby.	4	9
Down below.	4	9
Give it a break, Jughead.	4	9
I'm not shocked by your lesbian hijinks.	4	9
I just hope you know you can never do what a man can do.	4	9
That's true.	4	9
Bad news. Don showed up. We're on at 4:00.	4	9
-How was your siesta? Are you refreshed? -Yes.	4	9
Dr. Miller returned your call.	4	9
She said not to wake you and you needn't return.	4	9
But she got the message, and you're gonna have to wait.	4	9
-Thank you. -Are you going to the toilet?	4	9
I have to hire more copywriters, but these men come in and I know	4	9
the better they are, the more my job is in danger.	4	9
Oh, my.	4	9
Look who's here. Abe.	4	9
Peggy, I don't know if you remember Abe Drexler from Kellogg's loft party.	4	9
-Hi, I'm Peggy. -I remember.	4	9
Abe, you want to join us for a drink?	4	9
-Yes, please do. -Stay. I'll just stand here.	4	9
Can I get a Johnnie Walker with ice?	4	9
He didn't hear me.	4	9
You know what? I'm gonna go play darts.	4	9
-Take my seat. -Are you sure?	4	9
Pay for that. See you kids later.	4	9
I'm sorry. She's always so damn self-amused.	4	9
What are you talking about?	4	9
I was gonna stop by your office, but I didn't want to get you in trouble.	4	9
Then I thought about finding out where you live, but that's weird.	4	9
So anyway,	4	9
-it's nice running into you. -I don't know what to say.	4	9
That's very flattering-	4	9
That's howl meant it.	4	9
Johnnie Walker. Rocks.	4	9
The bartender here listens to me.	4	9
-May I help you? -Are you Joan Harris?	4	9
-I am. -We're from Madam lnga's.	4	9
You are to receive massage, manicure and pedicure.	4	9
-Can we? -I didn't order this.	4	9
It's a gift from a friend, tip included.	4	9
-What friend? -I'm not allowed to say this.	4	9
In Greece right now? Make no mistake, that's a revolution.	4	9
We are a hair away from everything falling apart in every society.	4	9
It's so tenuous.	4	9
All these corporations just throw their money at everyone	4	9
to keep the status quo intact 'cause the people outnumber them.	4	9
But in the blink of an eye, they could overturn everything.	4	9
It's an illusion that America's so organized and it could never happen over here.	4	9
-Are you from Brooklyn? -I am.	4	9
-Me, too. -I don't hear it.	4	9
One more drink and it'll come out.	4	9
Okay.	4	9
What am I talking to you about corporations for?	4	9
-You must deal with them all the time. -I guess.	4	9
Vick chemical, American tobacco,	4	9
but most of them are family businesses,	4	9
Samsonite, Fillmore Auto Parts, Sugarberry Ham...	4	9
Fillmore Auto Parts is worse than a corporation, what with the boycott and all.	4	9
-What boycott? -The Southern stores won't hire negroes.	4	9
Says who?	4	9
It was in the Voice. It was in a couple of places.	4	9
I don't think that's true. I would've heard that.	4	9
It is true.	4	9
That doesn't seem like them.	4	9
I'm sure they're perfectly nice for racists, you know,	4	9
and obviously your company has an investment in looking the other way.	4	9
Well, it's a complicated idea,	4	9
but in advertising, we don't really judge people.	4	9
We try and help them out of these situations.	4	9
Certainly we would try and stop this.	4	9
If it's true, it's not good for their business.	4	9
Jesus, I don't even know where to start.	4	9
You would've done a campaign for Goldwater?	4	9
You kidding? That would've been spectacular.	4	9
-Did you vote for him? -Of course not.	4	9
Civil rights isn't a situation to be fixed with some PR campaign.	4	9
It's an inequality that the world has its eyes on.	4	9
I know.	4	9
But I have to say,	4	9
most of the things negroes can't do, I can't do either,	4	9
and nobody seems to care.	4	9
What are you talking about?	4	9
Half of the meetings take place over golf, tennis,	4	9
in a bunch of clubs where I'm not allowed to be a member,	4	9
or even enter.	4	9
The University Club said the only way I could eat dinner there	4	9
was if I arrived in a cake.	4	9
There's no negro copywriters, you know.	4	9
I'm sure they could fight their way in like I did.	4	9
Believe me, nobody wanted me there.	4	9
All right, Peggy. We'll have a civil rights march for women.	4	9
I have a really early day.	4	9
It was nice to see you again.	4	9
I'm just saying they're not shooting women to keep them from voting. That's all.	4	9
Jesus. I'm really sorry.	4	9
I'm much better on paper.	4	9
You're opinionated and you're criticizing me.	4	9
That's not what I'm doing. This is discourse.	4	9
I knew I shouldn't have let Joyce leave.	4	9
Have a good night.	4	9
A three-letter word for a flightless bird.	4	9
Emu.	4	9
"Nope. It starts with an ""L."""	4	9
The hell it does.	4	9
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	4	9
Could I get some coffee? And let me know when Dr. Miller arrives.	4	9
It's hard, the way she breezes past me.	4	9
She's pushy, that one.	4	9
I guess that's what it takes.	4	9
-Morning. -Good morning.	4	9
-And thank you. -For what?	4	9
That was very thoughtful.	4	9
I Knew I was rubbing you the wrong way,	4	9
so I thought, why not have someone rub you the right way?	4	9
-I brought you bear claws. -Caroline won't let me have one	4	9
unless it's on the end of a real bear.	4	9
-Well, anyway. -Jeanie.	4	9
-it'll be okay. -People love to say that.	4	9
Look, I know you're having a tough run.	4	9
Let me get you a meal.	4	9
Take your mind off things?	4	9
Of course.	4	9
I forgot for a second that you're incapable of doing something nice	4	9
without expecting something nicer in return.	4	9
I didn't mean anything by it.	4	9
Honest.	4	9
Just thought you could use a night out.	4	9
-Thank you. I'm fine. -Good.	4	9
-What are you doing here? -I wrote something.	4	9
I kind of wrote it for you.	4	9
I would love it if you read it.	4	9
Nuremberg on Madison Avenue?	4	9
-What is this? -it's what I was trying to say last night,	4	9
but without, I don't know, my abrasive tone. Read it.	4	9
Right now in front of you?	4	9
No, take your time. I'll wait over here.	4	9
I have a lot to do.	4	9
I came all the way up here. I want to know what you think, okay?	4	9
These domesticated suburbanites	4	9
still have a primitive desire to get their hands dirty,	4	9
but they have become so removed from nature that they can't.	4	9
They don't know how to hunt or swing a hammer or fix their cars.	4	9
You mean like these two.	4	9
Actually, no. I'm from Vermont, and Don's a competitive fly fisherman.	4	9
What our findings show is that this demographic	4	9
will spend a good amount of money	4	9
for the satisfaction of being useful with their hands.	4	9
Ladies love a man who's good with his hands.	4	9
You think a mechanic comes in and sees these jokers	4	9
looking at fan belts, he's gonna stick around?	4	9
No offense.	4	9
What's the difference? Our inventory's the same.	4	9
I think if they see a coat and tie in aisle four, they'll think our prices went up.	4	9
I know I would.	4	9
Listen, salt of the earth, we need more than mechanics to survive.	4	9
You ever hear of Sears? They'll kill us.	4	9
We agreed we all had to agree.	4	9
Don't we have enough problems with the boycott?	4	9
Look, I don't want to get involved in a family squabble,	4	9
but I can't move forward until you agree on a strategy.	4	9
What if there were a way to market to both groups?	4	9
"""Fillmore Auto Parts."	4	9
"""Where the pros go, and everyone's welcome."""	4	9
-it's a little corny. -it's great and you know it.	4	9
"That's not a strategy. That's two strategies connected by the word ""and."""	4	9
"I can do ""where the pros go,"" or I can do ""everyone's welcome,"""	4	9
-but not both. -Sure you can.	4	9
Someone has to make a decision. There are three of you.	4	9
Vote.	4	9
Sean, what do you think?	4	9
-...don't know. -What?	4	9
You'll have to excuse me for a moment. Continue, please.	4	9
Why do we have to convince him?	4	9
What are you doing here?	4	9
I wanted to see you.	4	9
I am so sorry. Who are you?	4	9
My name is Vivian Winters,	4	9
and I'm going to assume you're her father since that's what she's led me to believe.	4	9
Don. What exactly is going on?	4	9
I found her on the train between carriages trying to avoid the conductor.	4	9
I didn't have enough money.	4	9
Megan, could you take her to my office?	4	9
Go.	4	9
Thank you.	4	9
Can I pay you for the ticket and your time?	4	9
You're just very lucky I ran into her before someone else did.	4	9
The types on that train? Someone should keep track of her.	4	9
You're right. I didn't know.	4	9
Men never know what's going on.	4	9
I offered you money and I said thank you.	4	9
She looks so chubby in the pictures.	4	9
Get her mother on the phone now.	4	9
What do you think you're doing?	4	9
I wanted to see you and I didn't want to wait two weekends.	4	9
You can't do this. This is very serious.	4	9
Mrs. Francis is on the line.	4	9
Guess who's sitting on my couch right now.	4	9
What are you talking about?	4	9
I'm talking about a stranger bringing Sally to my office	4	9
because she got on the train with no money.	4	9
You're kidding.	4	9
Carla was supposed to pick her up after the doctor.	4	9
How the hell did this happen?	4	9
Dr. Keener thought it would be good for her	4	9
to walk from camp to her appointment by herself.	4	9
Great idea. Thank you, psychiatry.	4	9
Don't yell at me. She needs to learn responsibility.	4	9
You need to learn responsibility.	4	9
Now come get her. I've got a business to run here.	4	9
Because it's so easy. It's so much fun to take care of her.	4	9
Enjoy.	4	9
-What? -Enjoy, Don.	4	9
I'm meeting Henry in the city tomorrow night. I'll get her then.	4	9
Don't move and don't touch anything.	4	9
I don't want to hear it. Just make sure she doesn't leave that room.	4	9
Are you serious with this?	4	9
Everyone knows who represents Fillmore Auto Parts.	4	9
-We're the agency of record. -But I was defending you.	4	9
We have a religion in this country and it's business.	4	9
You're not a priest. You're just another congregant.	4	9
So I'm not a war criminal.	4	9
Look, why should someone nice like you have to do this?	4	9
Why should you have to be a part of that corruption?	4	9
It's a waste of yours and a million other artists' gifts.	4	9
If you publish this, I'll lose my job.	4	9
Maybe you're better than this.	4	9
I'm not a political person.	4	9
I don't have to defend myself.	4	9
You're political whether you like it or not.	4	9
And you're not supposed to be insulted, you're supposed to be flattered.	4	9
Are you crazy?	4	9
You inspired me. I wrote this for you.	4	9
I guess I read you wrong.	4	9
You look so earnest.	4	9
I need your word that you'll destroy that.	4	9
Sure.	4	9
I won't bother you again.	4	9
Miss Blankenship.	4	9
Miss Blankenship, are you all right?	4	9
Miss Blankenship.	4	9
Miss Blankenship.	4	9
Caroline. Oh, God. Caroline!	4	9
-Do not come out of there. -I know!	4	9
What now?	4	9
Excuse me, Mr. Draper. I'm really sorry to bother you again.	4	9
-Are you sure? -I'm afraid so.	4	9
What happened?	4	9
Jesus.	4	9
Poor thing.	4	9
Should we call an ambulance?	4	9
The coroner.	4	9
What about them?	4	9
-I'll attend to this. -Sally's in there.	4	9
-Why? -She's visiting.	4	9
Megan, get a man, and we'll need a blanket.	4	9
There's an afghan on Mr. Crane's couch.	4	9
She seemed fine just a minute ago.	4	9
So where are we?	4	9
-Have we agreed on a strategy? -I'm not sure.	4	9
This is where we are.	4	9
Correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen,	4	9
but we believe by holding onto Fillmore's reputation	4	9
as a place for professional mechanics, we can actually attract men of all types.	4	9
So it's something like	4	9
"""Fillmore Auto Parts. For the mechanic in every man."""	4	9
And although it seems immaterial to you, the Fillmore brothers like it.	4	9
Unanimously.	4	9
What was that again?	4	9
"""Fillmore Auto Parts. For the mechanic in every man."""	4	9
My mother made that.	4	9
Can we get your signature?	4	9
I'm the president.	4	9
I think this is a winner.	4	9
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.	4	9
-Ken, can you show them out? -Of course. This way.	4	9
My goodness. I was just talking to her-	4	9
Listen, my daughter is sitting in my office.	4	9
-What? -She decided to run away today.	4	9
-Sally? -I'd really appreciate it	4	9
if you could go in my bag, get my keys,	4	9
take her to my apartment and just sit with her.	4	9
Are you sure?	4	9
I would have my secretary do it, but she's dead.	4	9
No, of course. Okay, do you want to introduce me?	4	9
I mean, what do I say to her?	4	9
Do we really have to have this discussion right now?	4	9
You're Faye.	4	9
Find Cooper and Roger at lunch	4	9
and stop them from bringing Secor back here.	4	9
Sally, this is my friend Faye.	4	9
-She's going to take you to my apartment. -why?	4	9
You don't want this to get worse. Believe me.	4	9
Hello. My name is Faye.	4	9
I know. My dad just said that.	4	9
Stop.	4	9
-Where are they taking her? -She's going to the morgue.	4	9
No, she's not. She's going to Frank E. Campbell.	4	9
Anyone track down her family?	4	9
She has a niece. I'll call her.	4	9
I'm sorry, Bert.	4	9
Roger.	4	9
You should go home.	4	9
-Yes. Take all my calls up here. -Okay.	4	9
So Fitzgerald says, “I promised to pour this whiskey	4	9
"""over your grave earlier, but do you mind if I pass it through me kidneys first?"""	4	9
-Are you all right? -Damn it, I don't want to die in this office.	4	9
-I almost have twice. -Stop it.	4	9
If it looks like I'm going, open a window. I'd rather flatten the top of a cab.	4	9
You are not going to die in this office.	4	9
Poor Ida.	4	9
She died like she lived.	4	9
Surrounded by the people she answered phones for.	4	9
I'm gonna go to my favorite restaurant and have a glass of cyanide.	4	9
Or you could join me.	4	9
I don't know.	4	9
-I'm gonna kill myself, Jeanie. -No, you're not.	4	9
Go get your things. I'll meet you in the lobby.	4	9
I got it.	4	9
"-Hello, Daddy. -Don't ""Hello, Daddy"" me."	4	9
Go sit down.	4	9
-How was it? -Great.	4	9
We watched a little TV, one of us took a nap.	4	9
You want to stay? You're gonna need to eat.	4	9
I Know, but I have dinner plans.	4	9
-Thank you. -Glad I could help.	4	9
-Good night, Sally. -Good night,	4	9
Can we order a pizza?	4	9
I want you to promise me you're never going to do this again.	4	9
I promise.	4	9
Why did you always pick this place?	4	9
No chance of running into anyone and, of course, cherry cheesecake.	4	9
Well, the clientele is older than I remember.	4	9
But not us.	4	9
I wish you would talk to me about things.	4	9
My husband doesn't like it.	4	9
I know it's tough,	4	9
but you must've known about the possibilities when he signed up.	4	9
I wasn't consulted.	4	9
You're kidding.	4	9
Because you always tell Jane about all of your decisions?	4	9
She's the woman behind the man, isn't she?	4	9
Did you listen to my memoirs?	4	9
I just have them transcribed and recycle the tapes.	4	9
"And you're not a little curious if there's a chapter called ""Joan""?"	4	9
There better not be.	4	9
I know. That's the problem.	4	9
And every time I think back, all the good stuff was with you.	4	9
And I'm sorry I keep pestering you.	4	9
I just can't help myself.	4	9
I don't expect anything to happen.	4	9
I appreciate that.	4	9
Can I ask you something?	4	9
Yes, I'm still mad at you.	4	9
Are you going to marry Faye?	4	9
What? No.	4	9
-Is she your girlfriend? -No.	4	9
She had your keys.	4	9
I gave her my keys.	4	9
She knew you had peanut butter.	4	9
Everyone has peanut butter.	4	9
She Said She Wanted to meet me.	4	9
Why would she want to meet me?	4	9
Look, I do like her,	4	9
but we just work together, and I talk about you a lot.	4	9
Do you like her?	4	9
-She seems nice. -Well, good.	4	9
Maybe you'll get to see her again some time.	4	9
Get out some plates.	4	9
'Cause I didn't want to take a cab on Broadway. It's a beautiful night.	4	9
I don't like this neighborhood anymore. What happened?	4	9
Miss Blankenship, you're not missing anything.	4	9
-Do you know what time it is? -I do.	4	9
Oh, God.	4	9
You know what to do.	4	9
-Roger... -Yes. Yes, we do. Look down.	4	9
Everything's going to be fine.	4	9
-There you go. -What about her?	4	9
Your bag.	4	9
Rings.	4	9
That's everything. We haven't seen anything.	4	9
I can't breathe.	4	9
-I want to scream. -Don't. Come over here.	4	9
-You have to calm down. -My ring. My ring.	4	9
Stop it. Everything can be replaced.	4	9
You're fine.	4	9
Don't stop.	4	9
Are you sure you don't want to call your mother or your brothers?	4	9
It's 9:30. They're asleep.	4	9
Daddy, I love you so much.	4	9
I love you, too.	4	9
Did you brush your hair?	4	9
I want to live with you all the time.	4	9
You can't do that, honey.	4	9
Why not? I'll be good.	4	9
Where are you gonna go to school down here?	4	9
What about your friends? What about your brothers?	4	9
They could live here, too. I'll watch them.	4	9
Sally.	4	9
Go to sleep.	4	9
-Sally? -I made French toast.	4	9
You know I don't like you using the stove.	4	9
Daddy, I do it all the time.	4	9
And there's no shells in it.	4	9
Do you want me to turn on the TV? We can watch The Today Show.	4	9
No.	4	9
-Where'd you learn how to do this? -Carla taught me.	4	9
What's on this?	4	9
Mrs. Butterworth's.	4	9
Go get it.	4	9
That's rum. Read labels.	4	9
Is it bad?	4	9
Not really.	4	9
Get dressed and I'll get you a bun at the office.	4	9
Can't we do something?	4	9
All right, here's the deal. No negotiating.	4	9
I'm gonna call in, move everything to noon, and we're gonna go to the Central Park Zoo.	4	9
And the dinosaur museum?	4	9
One or the other. We only have till noon.	4	9
You finish your breakfast. I'm going to get ready.	4	9
You want me to get Don to do it?	4	9
Of course, he didn't really know her.	4	9
No, he didn't.	4	9
Caroline, get Mrs. Harris.	4	9
It's regarding Ida Blankenship's obit.	4	9
That ought to get her in here.	4	9
This is an insult to her. I can't think of anything.	4	9
And I have no office in which to ruminate.	4	9
Cooper's trying to write an obit, something sharp and sweet.	4	9
Well, Mr. Cooper, shall we say,	4	9
"""Loyal friend, devoted caretaker..."""	4	9
"Put ""quietly in her sleep,"" of course."	4	9
-What's her profession? Secretary? -Executive secretary.	4	9
She was born in 1898 in a barn.	4	9
She died on the 37th floor of a skyscraper.	4	9
She's an astronaut.	4	9
Is this what it took to get you in here?	4	9
Look, I'm sorry.	4	9
It was in the heat of the moment.	4	9
And there was a moment. You know that.	4	9
I'm not sorry,	4	9
but I'm married.	4	9
And so are you.	4	9
I feel something, and I know you do.	4	9
Good afternoon.	4	9
-Hello. -Sally, this is Megan.	4	9
Where's Miss Blankenship?	4	9
She went away. I'm helping out for a little bit.	4	9
Her mother should be by at 5:00. Can you handle five minutes?	4	9
Are you hungry?	4	9
She ate plenty.	4	9
I'm gonna get coffee and check in.	4	9
Shit. Now we can't leave-	4	9
"Harry said, on the form where it says ""cause of death,"" they wrote ""Don Draper."""	4	9
How long do you think Yvette Mimieux's gonna last on his desk?	4	9
I say we start a pool on whether she's tired, quits or dies.	4	9
Where's Dr. Miller?	4	9
-I don't know if she's coming in. -She is.	4	9
The Fillmores want a jingle, a catchy tune.	4	9
Don't do that.	4	9
Harry says no rock and roll if we want middle-class men.	4	9
He was pushing Perry Como.	4	9
And we had Pat Boone, Roger Miller, Frankie Laine, Duane Eddy.	4	9
I'm glad I came in for this.	4	9
How about Harry Belafonte?	4	9
Everyone likes him.	4	9
I'll get you tickets to Harry Belafonte.	4	9
Believe me, he ain't selling auto parts for these guys.	4	9
Maybe it'll help them with their image in the South.	4	9
They don't want help.	4	9
Have you ever been to the South?	4	9
'Cause they have a way of doing things, and it doesn't include Harry Belafonte.	4	9
The Fillmore brothers are from Boston.	4	9
Same thing.	4	9
Why are we doing business with someone who doesn't hire negroes?	4	9
Our job is to make men like Fillmore Auto, not Fillmore Auto like negroes.	4	9
Pick one, get it written and recorded,	4	9
and if they want to change it, we will charge them to change it.	4	9
How about Dean Martin? He's friends with Sammy Davis Jr.	4	9
Does that work for you, Peggy?	4	9
Mrs. Francis is going to be in the lobby any minute.	4	9
I have to cover reception, per Joan's orders.	4	9
Go ahead.	4	9
Your mother's going to be downstairs in a minute.	4	9
-Get your things, -I wanna stay.	4	9
You can't.	4	9
I want to stay and I don't know why I can't.	4	9
Because you have to go home.	4	9
I'll be good. I promise.	4	9
-Come on. -No.	4	9
No! No!	4	9
No, no! I'm not going anywhere! Stop it!	4	9
Do you want me to carry you out of here?	4	9
I'm not going. I'm not leaving. I hate it there!	4	9
Is everything okay?	4	9
-Can you talk to her? -What?	4	9
Please. I can't bring her back kicking and screaming to her mother.	4	9
-I don't have much child psychology. -Just talk to her.	4	9
Dr. Faye wants to talk to you.	4	9
Hi, Sally. Remember me from yesterday?	4	9
I know you don't want to go, but you have to.	4	9
Your mother came all the way out here.	4	9
You don't know my mother.	4	9
Sally.	4	9
Sally,	4	9
sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do.	4	9
-Shut up. -What's gotten into you?	4	9
I don't think I'm helping here.	4	9
We don't want your help.	4	9
-Let's go, now. -Stop it! No! Stop it!	4	9
It's gonna be all right.	4	9
No, it's not.	4	9
I fall all the time.	4	9
I was coming to get you. Mrs... Your...	4	9
Sally's mother is in reception.	4	9
Thank you.	4	9
I was worried about you.	4	9
Come on, let's go.	4	9
I was waiting in the lobby at 5:00.	4	9
-We lost track of time. -Now I'm late.	4	9
Sally?	4	9
Say goodbye to your father.	4	9
Goodbye.	4	9
Excuse me.	4	9
Thank you.	4	9
Hi. Are you here to see Peggy?	4	9
Can you make me one of those?	4	9
No. No, I can't.	4	9
I can't do anything for you.	4	9
Why are you upset?	4	9
You shouldn't have put me in that position.	4	9
Things happen. I didn't plan it.	4	9
You asked me to go watch her.	4	9
There was no one else to do it.	4	9
And just now? What the hell was that?	4	9
I'm not good with kids.	4	9
That was not your fault.	4	9
Well, it feels like there was a test and l failed it.	4	9
God knows I'd be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind,	4	9
would I meet your children? When would I meet your children?	4	9
But I don't have any.	4	9
I'm sorry.	4	9
I love children, but I chose to be where I am.	4	9
I don't view it as a failure.	4	9
It doesn't matter.	4	9
I mean it.	4	9
Jesus. What a mess.	4	9
Part of it's good, right?	4	9
Yeah.	4	9
I'm gonna go. I didn't really sleep.	4	9
We can have dinner this weekend. I'll pick a place.	4	9
Good.	4	9
Why are you drinking here?	4	9
Come on.	4	9
I don't know what kind of surprise you're gonna spring on me.	4	9
So Abe Drexler pulled a boner. it's to be expected.	4	9
He seemed so nice.	4	9
He's a man. He won't be happy until he turns you out.	4	9
What's that supposed to mean?	4	9
You gotta be their girl. It's the way they want it. Maybe it's biology.	4	9
It's like men are this vegetable soup,	4	9
and we can't put them on a plate or eat them off the counter.	4	9
So women are the pot.	4	9
They heat them up. They hold them. They contain them.	4	9
But who wants to be a pot?	4	9
Who the hell said we're not soup?	4	9
I don't think that's true.	4	9
It's been my experience.	4	9
But you know, I wouldn't have helped Abe out	4	9
if I didn't think he was some very interesting soup.	4	9
Listen, go ahead without me.	4	9
Another time.	4	9
Are you angry or lovesick?	4	9
I don't know.	4	9
Night, Peg.	4	9
Could you hold that?	4	9
Hello.	4	9
I need to speak with you.	4	10
Away from the neighbors?	4	10
Roger.	4	10
So, here we are.	4	10
Weeks later, man out of town.	4	10
Well, I know you, Red. This is the tenderloin of your distress.	4	10
I'm late.	4	10
-What? -I'm very late.	4	10
Congratulations.	4	10
-I thought you should know. -Me?	4	10
He's been gone for seven weeks. It can't be his.	4	10
 -Are you sure? -There hasn't been anyone else.	4	10
No, no, are you sure you're...	4	10
You know, are you sure that's what's going on?	4	10
Have you had a rabbit test?	4	10
I can't go to my doctor.	4	10
Hey, look at me.	4	10
You're overreacting. One step at a time.	4	10
Let me take care of this.	4	10
I'm really sorry.	4	10
These things happen, right?	4	10
Will you stop being so upset?	4	10
Very well, then. I'll wait on your word.	4	10
Buck up. It's gonna be fine.	4	10
Get me an outside line.	4	10
 -Francis residence. -it's me. Has Sally left for camp yet?	4	10
-No. -Can I speak with her?	4	10
You can try.	4	10
Sally, come in here!	4	10
Your father is on the phone.	4	10
Talk to him.	4	10
-Hello. -I missed you this weekend.	4	10
And I have a big surprise for you.	4	10
Can you keep a secret?	4	10
Do you think your friends are going to be jealous	4	10
when they find out that you're going to see The Beatles	4	10
on Sunday at Shea Stadium?	4	10
-What? -You heard me.	4	10
Hello? Sally?	4	10
What's going on?	4	10
I'm gonna need her Sunday. We're going to see The Beatles.	4	10
Oh, my goodness. Sally, say thank you.	4	10
Thank you, Daddy. Thank you, thank you, thank you.	4	10
You can't be mad at me if I wear earplugs.	4	10
I won't. I promise.	4	10
Okay, see you Sunday.	4	10
You have a guest in reception.	4	10
I'm on my way.	4	10
Hello.	4	10
Lane, you're looking well.	4	10
This is unexpected.	4	10
Have you brought Nigel?	4	10
No, I haven't.	4	10
Good morning, Lane. That's quite a reception.	4	10
John Gibbons, George Casey, this is Robert Pryce, my father.	4	10
-Hello. -Sir.	4	10
-Laura will show you inside. -Pleasure to meet you.	4	10
I'm here to bring you home.	4	10
This was not the arrangement.	4	10
Rebecca doesn't want to see you unless you're in London.	4	10
But Nigel does.	4	10
I'm here to bring you home.	4	10
I'll be at the Warwick until Friday. That should be ample time.	4	10
Well, there's no reason to stay, then.	4	10
Well, I suppose we should at least dine together.	4	10
Have you plans for this evening?	4	10
I do now.	4	10
I guess we're just a little confused about what it is we're selling.	4	10
Senator Murphy would be appreciative	4	10
if voters were very aware of the hundreds of millions of dollars	4	10
he's brought to California.	4	10
North American Aviation is a friend of Anaheim.	4	10
Pork is only half of it.	4	10
The guidance and control systems in the Minuteman II	4	10
have significant civilian potential.	4	10
United, TWA, American, they're gonna want this.	4	10
"So you never have to say the word ""bomb,"" right?"	4	10
That's good.	4	10
Gentlemen. Don't get up.	4	10
How would you feel about avoiding the idea of defense altogether?	4	10
If you think that's best.	4	10
We'd prefer something more comprehensive, though.	4	10
Defense, cutting-edge technology and, of course, the Moon.	4	10
We've got a 60% bump in our advertising budget to $4 million.	4	10
I assume this means television.	4	10
We're taking this very seriously.	4	10
And so are we.	4	10
We see this as the beginning of a new era	4	10
in the relationship between North American Aviation,	4	10
and Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.	4	10
There'll be fewer black bars as the process moves forward.	4	10
-Gibby. George. -Don.	4	10
-Good to see you both again. -Likewise.	4	10
I should get on a plane to the coast immediately.	4	10
Why? I thought we were talking about Meet the Press.	4	10
I don't see Minuteman missiles breaking up the Hillbillies.	4	10
I have to go anyway.	4	10
Give me those tickets before you go anywhere.	4	10
Don't worry. They're coming.	4	10
I'm not worried. Not in the slightest.	4	10
My father has come to visit.	4	10
I wonder if you might join us for dinner this evening.	4	10
I may have plans.	4	10
I'd consider it a personal favor.	4	10
So how long is your visit?	4	10
Too short.	4	10
So, Father, how have you found your accommodations?	4	10
Adequate, sixth floor.	4	10
Father likes a view.	4	10
I was quite impressed with your office.	4	10
I think the view's better here.	4	10
Hello, gentlemen. I'm your bunny, Judy. May I see your key, please?	4	10
Lane Pryce.	4	10
Are you the keyholder or is this a borrowed key?	4	10
I am the keyholder.	4	10
May I take your cocktail order, Mr. Pryce?	4	10
Three whiskey sours would do.	4	10
She's asking what you want, not how many you've had.	4	10
I'll have a nice bourbon.	4	10
Whiskey sour sounds good.	4	10
And, Judy,	4	10
could you see if that lovely creature could drop by?	4	10
Of course.	4	10
So what's your line, Robert?	4	10
Carrington Surgical, but I retired.	4	10
Father was a salesman.	4	10
And, therefore, no stranger to places such as these.	4	10
Hello. How are you gentlemen this evening?	4	10
Quite good, thank you.	4	10
Toni, I'd like to introduce you to some special guests of mine.	4	10
My father Robert and my colleague Don.	4	10
I tried to get us booked in your section, but it seems you're very popular.	4	10
Mr. Pryce.	4	10
I hope you gentlemen enjoy your evening with us,	4	10
and let me know if there's anything I can do.	4	10
We will.	4	10
She's the finest waitress-	4	10
I'd be partial to anyone who brings us our drinks.	4	10
Hello, may I help you?	4	10
-Is this the Francis home? -It is.	4	10
I'm special Agent Norris and this is special Agent Landingham	4	10
from the Department of Defense. May we come in?	4	10
What is this regarding?	4	10
I promise there's no reason to be alarmed.	4	10
I... Well, I don't know what this is regarding,	4	10
but I'm sure you'd rather speak with my husband,	4	10
and he's not home, obviously.	4	10
We need to speak with you.	4	10
Your ex-husband Donald Draper has requested	4	10
security clearance regarding business with the United States Government,	4	10
and it's our job to confirm his application.	4	10
It's a routine background check, so, you see, there's no reason to be nervous.	4	10
No, of course.	4	10
Do you mind if I get my cigarettes?	4	10
Of course not.	4	10
So, Mrs. Francis, you were married to Donald Draper for how long?	4	10
Eleven years.	4	10
And, in general, would you describe him as a man of integrity?	4	10
We divorced. We obviously had differences.	4	10
No, of course.	4	10
Do you recall any of the magazines or newspapers	4	10
Mr. Draper read when you were married?	4	10
Anything that struck you as radical or subversive in nature?	4	10
No. He read, but mostly for work.	4	10
Did he belong to any clubs or organizations?	4	10
New York Athletic Club.	4	10
Would you describe him as loyal?	4	10
Excuse me?	4	10
By that, we mean anything that might have given you	4	10
doubts about Mr. Draper's allegiance to the United States.	4	10
Any possible ties or sympathies to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.	4	10
No, nothing like that.	4	10
So, do you have any reason to believe Mr. Draper isn't who he says he is?	4	10
What was that? I'm sorry.	4	10
It's a standard question. I know it sounds funny.	4	10
No.	4	10
It's Mrs. Francis. Are you in?	4	10
I'll take it. And, Megan, can you check on those tickets?	4	10
Of course.	4	10
-Hello. -I just spent 40 minutes	4	10
-with two men from the government. -What?	4	10
Couldn't you have at least given me some warning?	4	10
Betts, I don't know what you're talking about.	4	10
Well, you applied for some security clearance,	4	10
and they need to know all about you and I've been through hell, Don.	4	10
I'm sick to my stomach.	4	10
Hold on.	4	10
-What exactly happened? -What?	4	10
Who were they?	4	10
Two men from the Defense Department,	4	10
and they asked me all kinds of questions about you.	4	10
-About what? -I don't remember everything.	4	10
Your military service, your politics, your loyalty, your name.	4	10
And what did you say?	4	10
What do you think I said? Nothing.	4	10
Hello? Are you there?	4	10
I'm sorry. I...	4	10
Jesus.	4	10
I didn't know anything about this.	4	10
I don't know if I should even be talking on the phone.	4	10
Of course you should.	4	10
There's no problem with any of that.	4	10
You know, my husband works for the governor.	4	10
You should've told me they were coming.	4	10
You're right. I'm sorry for inconveniencing you.	4	10
Okay. Well, goodbye, then.	4	10
-Betty. -Yes?	4	10
Thank you.	4	10
Megan, have I been contacted by the Department of Defense?	4	10
Yes, of course. There was a form.	4	10
-I filled it out, you signed it. -What?	4	10
Two weeks ago. I have it. Did you want to change something?	4	10
-I never looked at it. -But you signed it.	4	10
Why didn't you tell me what it was?	4	10
It's standard information. It's in your employment records.	4	10
Just your name, Social Security number, marital status.	4	10
This is very serious, Megan. I should have been consulted.	4	10
We have a contact number.	4	10
I'm sure you can change anything you need to.	4	10
Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.	4	10
You're right. You're absolutely right.	4	10
If you want to fire me, I'd understand completely.	4	10
Is Mr. Campbell still at lunch?	4	10
-Yes. -Let me know the minute he returns.	4	10
Bye.	4	10
-How did you get in here? -I paid someone.	4	10
Nigel didn't come. He's not coming.	4	10
I'm sorry, baby, but you can't do what you're doing,	4	10
and you can't do what you did last night.	4	10
-You're gonna cost me my job. -I know. I know.	4	10
I apologize.	4	10
You know that I love you,	4	10
my chocolate bunny.	4	10
Stop it.	4	10
I love you, too.	4	10
I just wanted Father to meet you.	4	10
Well, that was a silly way to do it.	4	10
And I don't know why you're asking for trouble.	4	10
No. You're in my life.	4	10
I want him to know why I'm staying.	4	10
Why do you have to be so damn dashing?	4	10
I'll ring you.	4	10
What kind of man are you?	4	10
You've used this woman, and you've ruined her.	4	10
Hold on a second...	4	10
A man of your age, only slightly younger than myself,	4	10
that you could behave with such selfishness, such irresponsibility.	4	10
We came here for your discretion, not your judgment.	4	10
I know why you came here.	4	10
There's a good man, he's not in the city.	4	10
He has a practice in Morristown. It's $400.	4	10
Here.	4	10
I don't want it in my handwriting.	4	10
Shut the door.	4	10
Were you aware that we applied for a security clearance	4	10
to the Department of Defense?	4	10
Did that go through already?	4	10
Pete.	4	10
They interviewed Betty. G-men.	4	10
Why did you fill out the form?	4	10
Megan did.	4	10
And I signed it without looking, because that's what I do.	4	10
What did Betty say? You've been fine this long.	4	10
There's three lies in eight questions here.	4	10
If they talk to his family, he was an engineer. My age is wrong.	4	10
Jesus. I didn't even think about it.	4	10
I remember you mentioned once.	4	10
Don't you have a friend there?	4	10
And what's he supposed to do?	4	10
Stop it. Kill it. At least find out how far it's gone.	4	10
Calm down. Let me think.	4	10
Look, this isn't your problem. I just want some warning.	4	10
Why? What are you gonna do?	4	10
Whatever I have to.	4	10
You can run the agency without me.	4	10
Are you kidding me?	4	10
I'll look into it. Immediately. Okay?	4	10
I hate this.	4	10
Not that I would change anything, but I hate that it happened.	4	10
You know, not the first part, but this.	4	10
I understand.	4	10
Don't you feel the same way? I mean, what if this is a sign?	4	10
I haven't stopped thinking about you.	4	10
Maybe I'm in love with you.	4	10
So you want to keep it?	4	10
No, of course not, but it's just...	4	10
I mean, if there's going to be something between us,	4	10
I don't want it to start this way.	4	10
Do you? With a scandal?	4	10
I see.	4	10
But I guess you could keep it.	4	10
I mean, when he comes home, who's gonna know the difference?	4	10
Lots of Gls came home to a little surprise. No one did the math.	4	10
It wouldn't be my child. Let's make that clear.	4	10
I mean, if he comes home.	4	10
Jesus.	4	10
-Greg dying is not a solution to this. -Okay, okay.	4	10
I'm desperate.	4	10
I'm just trying to think of what's best for you.	4	10
I'm going to take care of it.	4	10
Well... Whatever you want.	4	10
I'll take care of it, obviously.	4	10
-When? -Immediately.	4	10
And I don't want you to come.	4	10
You sure? At least let me drive you.	4	10
We shouldn't be seen together.	4	10
I don't need you to come.	4	10
Look, I'm sorry I missed dinner.	4	10
It's fine, Henry. I know that you're working.	4	10
Don't say it like that.	4	10
I'm just tired. it's late.	4	10
I have to tell you something.	4	10
Two men came from the FBI today.	4	10
What?	4	10
They interviewed me for 45 minutes about Don.	4	10
Why?	4	10
Some kind of security clearance.	4	10
Really?	4	10
Well, that's what they do.	4	10
Is that what you're upset about?	4	10
Please don't make me feel silly.	4	10
I didn't know if I was allowed to say anything.	4	10
You can always tell me.	4	10
And if everything goes as I hope,	4	10
one day you may be talking to those people on my behalf.	4	10
I just wanted you to know they were here,	4	10
because I don't...	4	10
Well, I don't want any secrets.	4	10
Okay.	4	10
I've got it.	4	10
Take the next one.	4	10
He's looking into it.	4	10
How many people does he have to talk to?	4	10
If you're asking if he knows how to keep a secret,	4	10
he works for the Department of Defense.	4	10
But he talks to you?	4	10
It's going to be okay. I was thinking about this,	4	10
and I know it'll be uncomfortable, but if we have to, we can ride it out.	4	10
-Are you crazy? -This many years later?	4	10
It must be past the statute of limitations.	4	10
It's desertion.	4	10
There's no statute of limitations.	4	10
I thought nobody cared about these things.	4	10
What am I supposed to do?	4	10
I don't know. You've been doing it for years.	4	10
I don't have to live with your shit over my head.	4	10
You know, I signed this account after you disappeared in California.	4	10
It's taken three years, but I've grown it from cocktails to $4 million.	4	10
Get rid of it.	4	10
Good morning. Mr. Keller is here. Would you like some coffee?	4	10
No, thank you.	4	10
I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.	4	10
Well, you said you couldn't discuss it over the phone,	4	10
so I assume it's serious.	4	10
Well...	4	10
I'm interested in setting up some kind of trust for my kids.	4	10
Well, starting from when? Eighteen years old? Twenty-one years old?	4	10
Now.	4	10
And I want it to be the kind of account their mother can access.	4	10
Don, why would she need anything?	4	10
Look,	4	10
if circumstances conspire,	4	10
she'll know why.	4	10
I don't like this. I don't like this at all.	4	10
An emergency meeting and... I'll be honest. You seem very edgy.	4	10
-What's going on? -Nothing.	4	10
It just ran through my mind that maybe I'm not prepared.	4	10
I know this has been hard on you, the divorce, but don't go spinning.	4	10
Everybody has bad dreams every once in a while.	4	10
The wound is still fresh. It'll heal in time.	4	10
Just tell me that you'll do that, and I'll sleep better.	4	10
Okay, but I'll tell you, I don't like hearing that tone in your voice.	4	10
Don't worry. I'm fine.	4	10
Now, please tell me you're shtupping that girl out there.	4	10
Hillary.	4	10
Are you sure you don't want me to come in?	4	10
Are you all right?	4	10
Yes.	4	10
I'm sure I will be in a minute.	4	10
She's 17 years old. What do I say to her?	4	10
I had her when I was 15, and I don't regret it,	4	10
but she seems so much younger.	4	10
She's very beautiful.	4	10
Thank you.	4	10
She is.	4	10
I'm sorry.	4	10
There's no one to talk to.	4	10
I understand.	4	10
Thank you for being so sweet.	4	10
How old is your daughter?	4	10
I'm sorry. I shouldn't pry.	4	10
Fifteen.	4	10
Dr. Miller is here to see you.	4	10
Send her in.	4	10
I owe you a phone call, don't I?	4	10
Yes, you do.	4	10
Are you all right? What happened?	4	10
I've been snowed under. I should've called. I should've called today. I have to cancel.	4	10
You look sick.	4	10
-You have a fever. -Yeah, I haven't been feeling well.	4	10
-Let me take you home. -I'll be fine.	4	10
Come on, get your coat.	4	10
This pretty young thing, she didn't know which way to turn	4	10
with my father on one end of the hall and my uncle on the other.	4	10
Should've tried that move at Gettysburg.	4	10
My grandpa fought in the Civil War.	4	10
Really? Where did he surrender?	4	10
He never surrendered.	4	10
That man could turn going to the shitter into a parade.	4	10
-What are you doing? -I'm getting this.	4	10
Why would you do that?	4	10
Sometimes a fella's gotta pick up the check.	4	10
Since when?	4	10
You know that I like you, Roger. Hell, you're a genuine character.	4	10
I'm sorry. That's the long and the short of it.	4	10
What the hell is that supposed to mean?	4	10
It's over.	4	10
I'm sorry.	4	10
Are you kidding me?	4	10
Are you trying to kill me? Is that your plan?	4	10
If you want to put us through our paces,	4	10
we will shake heaven and earth for you. You know that.	4	10
Just tell me it's for show beforehand, because, I swear, you're going to kill me.	4	10
Roger, it wasn't my decision.	4	10
Since Daddy's incapacitation,	4	10
the board has been more aggressive,	4	10
and that's never been my bailiwick. You know that.	4	10
But they want to consolidate everything. One agency, one rate,	4	10
all the ad work, all the brands.	4	10
So fine, let's.... You know what?	4	10
Get Draper in a room with them. Where do they want to go?	4	10
Where do you think? BBDO.	4	10
You think you'll get the kind of attention you get at Sterling Cooper?	4	10
Well, you're not Sterling Cooper anymore.	4	10
That's right. We're better, and We're devoted to you.	4	10
Oh, hell. I don't want you to think this is for cause. There's no reason.	4	10
There's nothing you can do. Nothing you could do.	4	10
It's just the way it is.	4	10
Wait. This is not happening.	4	10
You don't just end business with people after 25... 30 years!	4	10
We're family.	4	10
I invited you to my daughter's wedding.	4	10
I don't know why you didn't get the invitation.	4	10
You should fire your secretary is what you should do,	4	10
not fire your agency!	4	10
We're dead. You know that.	4	10
The question is when?	4	10
We're gonna call for the files on Monday.	4	10
No, you can't do that. I'm begging you.	4	10
You can't do that. You've gotta give me some time.	4	10
I told you, Roger. It's done.	4	10
You're not gonna win these fellas over.	4	10
-Give me 30 days. -What's that gonna do?	4	10
After all the lies I've told for you, you owe me that!	4	10
I don't owe you squat.	4	10
You inherited this account.	4	10
Thirty days.	4	10
Keep it under your hat.	4	10
Give me a chance to get our affairs in order.	4	10
I'm begging you.	4	10
Okay. I can do that.	4	10
Thank you.	4	10
No hard feelings.	4	10
-Excuse me. -Yes?	4	10
I'm really sorry. We're looking for the Vernons.	4	10
I don't know them.	4	10
-Is this 110 Waverly? -No.	4	10
What'd I tell you? Sorry about that.	4	10
-Are you all right? -Don't...	4	10
I'm gonna get you a glass of water. Sit down.	4	10
Are you all right?	4	10
I think I'm having a heart attack.	4	10
Are you in pain? Is it in your chest?	4	10
No, but I can't breathe.	4	10
Stop it. Please, don't touch me.	4	10
If there's no pain, you're not having a heart attack.	4	10
You're not a real doctor.	4	10
My father has a heart condition. I've been through this, okay?	4	10
You should go.	4	10
I'm not going anywhere. I'm not leaving you like this.	4	10
-Good evening. -Good evening, Father. Do come in.	4	10
Father, come with me. I'd like you to meet someone.	4	10
Properly this time.	4	10
Toni Charles, this is my father Robert Pryce.	4	10
-How do you do? -A pleasure to meet you again.	4	10
How are you Ending the city? Are you enjoying yourself?	4	10
I am.	4	10
Very well, then. What do you say we all head to dinner and get acquainted?	4	10
As delightful as that sounds, I'm afraid I'm traveling tomorrow.	4	10
I'm terribly sorry.	4	10
Well, that's too bad.	4	10
But please, go on ahead. I don't want to ruin your evening.	4	10
Well, of course.	4	10
Toni, why don't you run along ahead, and I'll join you in a bit?	4	10
Don't want to lose our reservation.	4	10
Well, it was a pleasure to meet you. Lane said so many nice things about you.	4	10
Yes.	4	10
I'll be right along, darling.	4	10
Come along. Out with it.	4	10
I see your face.	4	10
Are you more distraught that I found someone I love,	4	10
or that she's a negro?	4	10
You're coming home, Lane.	4	10
I'm afraid I've moved on!	4	10
Put your home in order.	4	10
Either there, or here.	4	10
You will not live in between.	4	10
What was that?	4	10
Yes.	4	10
What was that?	4	10
Yes, sir.	4	10
Darling, what's wrong?	4	10
I can't tell you.	4	10
Peter, look at me.	4	10
Is there something I should know?	4	10
Trudy, no. it's nothing to do with you. Come here.	4	10
You should talk to me. You'll feel better.	4	10
How is it that some people just walk through life,	4	10
dragging their lies with them, destroying everything they touch?	4	10
-Who are you talking about? -I loathe it.	4	10
No one ever knows.	4	10
Except the honest people who have to pick up the pieces.	4	10
I don't know what you're talking about,	4	10
and I want to.	4	10
No, you don't.	4	10
And I don't want you to.	4	10
You can tell me anything.	4	10
What was that?	4	10
Just a kick. He's turning over. Feel.	4	10
Just remember, everything's good here.	4	10
No, we don't go to East Hampton anymore. We go to Southampton.	4	10
It's a rental, but it's a beaut.	4	10
So listen, it's been wonderful catching up,	4	10
but I have to admit I'm calling for Larry, actually.	4	10
What?	4	10
No.	4	10
God, I'm so sorry to hear that.	4	10
When did that happen?	4	10
I mean,	4	10
when did he go?	4	10
I mean, what happened?	4	10
Louise, I'm so sorry.	4	10
I obviously didn't know. I must've been out of town.	4	10
Do you want something to help you sleep? I might have a Valium.	4	10
Why didn't you tell me that two hours ago?	4	10
I don't know. I just thought of it. I never take them.	4	10
Thank you for staying.	4	10
I don't know what happened.	4	10
I think you do.	4	10
Those men,	4	10
who did you think they were?	4	10
I'm so tired.	4	10
Please, tell me what's wrong.	4	10
It's me.	4	10
I'm tired of running.	4	10
Running from what?	4	10
In Korea, I was wounded,	4	10
but this other man was killed, and they mixed us up.	4	10
I wanted them to.	4	10
And I	4	10
just kept living	4	10
as him.	4	10
Oh, my goodness.	4	10
Yup.	4	10
But, now, I think that's over.	4	10
What happened?	4	10
North American Aviation told the government	4	10
they need to know who I am.	4	10
What are you gonna do?	4	10
There's nothing to do.	4	10
Well, can't you get a lawyer?	4	10
You were a kid.	4	10
Turn yourself in, have someone plead for clemency.	4	10
It's not that simple.	4	10
There are things you can do.	4	10
I shouldn't have told you,	4	10
but I'm just so damn tired of all of it.	4	10
Hey,	4	10
I'm glad you told me.	4	10
I don't want to talk at the office, and I don't want to talk over the phone.	4	10
Come in.	4	10
I spoke to Russ,	4	10
and you haven't been flagged.	4	10
And if we end things with NAA, the investigation will stop where it is.	4	10
Thank God.	4	10
So I walk away from $4 million,	4	10
and I just keep this to myself, because why?	4	10
Because you can't live in the open?	4	10
You don't know any other way.	4	10
I come here unannounced and there's another thing I don't want to know.	4	10
Tell NAA we want Martin Marietta or Hughes.	4	10
And what do I tell the partners?	4	10
I called your house a hundred times last night.	4	10
I'm fine. Everything went fine.	4	10
Should you even be here? Should you be on your feet?	4	10
Roger.	4	10
Oh, God. I wish I could hold you right now.	4	10
It's okay. I feel good.	4	10
I feel awful.	4	10
We avoided a tragedy.	4	10
What? Yeah.	4	10
We have a partners meeting.	4	10
Christ. Really?	4	10
Come on. Life goes on.	4	10
You're so beautiful.	4	10
-Gentlemen. -Morning.	4	10
Let me call to order a meeting of the partners. In attendance...	4	10
Get on with it.	4	10
I don't know how to explain it, but I have some serious news.	4	10
North American Aviation is moving on.	4	10
What happened?	4	10
There was a misunderstanding. Some names were left off of a document.	4	10
A General was insulted. I apologized, but the damage was done.	4	10
Well, that's just great.	4	10
What General?	4	10
Unfortunately, this is irreparable.	4	10
How can that be?	4	10
Because I didn't pay enough attention.	4	10
That's your only damn job.	4	10
I swear, when I think what we're trying to do here,	4	10
when all you had to do is hold their hands and jerk 'em off.	4	10
Is that so hard to do, Campbell?	4	10
We have to come in here and have this catastrophe dropped into our lap	4	10
because you don't know what the hell you're doing,	4	10
-because you fucked up! -Hey!	4	10
Roger.	4	10
That's the business we're in, accounts come in, accounts go out.	4	10
Roger, I think you should apologize.	4	10
I'm sorry.	4	10
I have an announcement.	4	10
I'm going to be taking a leave of absence. Two weeks, perhaps a month,	4	10
to return to London and tend to my family.	4	10
I shall be reachable by telex and telephone.	4	10
And I can say with full confidence that the company is in a state of stability,	4	10
even with this morning's news.	4	10
And all matters financial may be referred to Mrs. Harris.	4	10
Very well, then.	4	10
I'm sorry.	4	10
Is there more business?	4	10
Shall we go down the current status of accounts?	4	10
Lucky Strike?	4	10
Vick Chemical?	4	10
Send her in.	4	10
How are you?	4	10
I didn't expect you to stop by.	4	10
Stop it. I've been worried.	4	10
I'm fine. Everything's fine.	4	10
Let's get something to eat.	4	10
I think I'd better be on my own tonight.	4	10
Why don't we see each other tomorrow?	4	10
Okay.	4	10
We'll figure out what to do. I promise.	4	10
We'll see.	4	10
Mn Draper?	4	10
-Saturday night? -Yes.	4	10
Very good, then. You can call me with the details. Good night.	4	10
Good night.	4	10
I Know I messed so many things up and I...	4	10
Well, I got Mr. Crane to get these sent over.	4	10
It's The Beatles tickets. I thought you'd want them right away.	4	10
Yes. Thank you.	4	10
You see? Everything worked out.	4	10
Yes. Thank you.	4	10
I hope it's okay, but it's almost 8:00. Do you need me?	4	10
No. You can go.	4	10
Thank you.	4	10
I have sand in the weirdest places.	4	11
Jones beach? Don't be so sure it's sand.	4	11
Hold up.	4	11
We got hitchers.	4	11
- Made it. - ? see that.	4	11
Hey.	4	11
Hi.	4	11
Girls, on the hop.	4	11
You gotta get up.	4	11
All I want to say is I did not plan this.	4	11
Nobody talk. I'm really stoned.	4	11
 I'm sorry.	4	11
You're like a pound or less.	4	11
I see you went in.	4	11
I like the water.	4	11
Can I quote you on that?	4	11
I'm learning.	4	11
- Oh my God. You're a slob. - Shh!	4	11
We have to be quiet. I have a roommate.	4	11
God, I love your shoulders.	4	11
You look like you're in the Olympics.	4	11
You never stop talking.	4	11
It was like the movies. One minute we're listening	4	11
To a lecture on rhododendrons,	4	11
The next, Patricia is driving	4	11
 Like a speed racer to the hospital.	4	11
And Trudy keeps apologizing in the back seat.	4	11
"We're saying, ""it's okay. Nobody cares."	4	11
"You're having a baby!"""	4	11
Meanwhile, Campbell's on the back nine	4	11
With his father-in-law, who's also a client.	4	11
Well, that's a nice way to end a round.	4	11
Ken Cosgrove. Don't get up.	4	11
John Flory.	4	11
This is my fiancée Cynthia,	4	11
Her parents, ed and Lillian Baxter.	4	11
- Sorry to interrupt. - ?t's a pleasure.	4	11
- Nice to meet you. - Aren't you lucky?	4	11
I'm spending my Sunday night with dodge.	4	11
Nice to see you, Ken. And I'm sorry about, you know.	4	11
- My condolences. - Oh, David Montgomery?	4	11
I was only there for about six months. I didn't really know him.	4	11
Oh. Right.	4	11
Well, I should be on my way.	4	11
- ?t was nice meeting you all. - Mmn.	4	11
Flory.	4	11
Look, you're with your family.	4	11
- ? shouldn't have said anything. - You didn't.	4	11
What's going on?	4	11
Lucky strike.	4	11
They're coming over to us.	4	11
What?	4	11
Look, you didn't hear it from me, okay?	4	11
You're winding me up.	4	11
No. American tobacco came in last Monday,	4	11
Said they're moving all the brands to us.	4	11
Well, that's not true.	4	11
Someone should tell Lee garner Jr. That.	4	11
Sorry.	4	11
You okay, son?	4	11
Whenever ad men meet, all they ever do is brag and brag.	4	11
It's hard not to get rattled.	4	11
Ed, Lillian, you'll have to excuse me.	4	11
Sweetheart, I swear to you I wouldn't do this	4	11
If it wasn't serious.	4	11
Ken! What a pleasant surprise!	4	11
There's nothing much to celebrate yet.	4	11
They were going to send Trudy home, but her mother protested.	4	11
I sent her for food just to get rid of her.	4	11
Anyway, I suppose your visit is premature.	4	11
- ? shouldn't use that word around here. - Can I talk to you?	4	11
John Flory, some prick over at b. B.D.O.,	4	11
Just told me that lucky strike is going there.	4	11
What?	4	11
You made me wait for you	4	11
While you worked.	4	11
I'm not waiting anymore.	4	11
I should get it.	4	11
Of course. The kids.	4	11
- Hello? - ?t's Pete.	4	11
Have you heard anything about lucky strike leaving?	4	11
- No. - Ken heard from somebody at b. B.D.O	4	11
- That Lucky's coming over. - Bullshit. Call Roger.	4	11
I did. He's out.	4	11
Wake Cooper. Meet me in the office.	4	11
- What happened? - ?'m not sure.	4	11
I have to make a call.	4	11
Hello?	4	11
- What's going on? - Ken here	4	11
Heard that lucky strike is leaving.	4	11
- That they've already left. - What?	4	11
- Who told you what? - John Flory.	4	11
He's an account executive at b. B. D.O. That's where they're going.	4	11
- No. That's impossible. - Call him.	4	11
I'm telling you it's impossible.	4	11
Don't lose your temper.	4	11
Somebody call lane in London?	4	11
Yeah, I don't think he'll go back to sleep.	4	11
Could I get a drink?	4	11
It's ringing.	4	11
Lee. Roger sterling.	4	11
From your agency?	4	11
Well, it's serious.	4	11
He's drunk.	4	11
You're damn right I heard.	4	11
Because you can consolidate your business here.	4	11
Just because your father's non compos mentis	4	11
Doesn't mean you have to listen to the board.	4	11
It's bullshit! Lee!	4	11
30 years?	4	11
I have to hear it on the street?	4	11
No review? Nothing?	4	11
He hung up.	4	11
It's true?	4	11
Tomorrow morning we're getting on the 6:00 A. M. To Raleigh-Durham.	4	11
I'll do it.	4	11
I've known him half my life.	4	11
I need a drink.	4	11
- What time is it? - Midnight.	4	11
You want one?	4	11
Looks like you need both.	4	11
It looks like lucky strike might have gone South.	4	11
Holy crap.	4	11
Obviously we'd like to avoid that information getting out.	4	11
What happened?	4	11
Supposedly, they're consolidating	4	11
For a reduced commission at b. B.D.O.	4	11
Hey, watch it. You have to keep a clear head.	4	11
Every day, I tried not to think about what would happen	4	11
If this happened.	4	11
Aw, look at that plum.	4	11
- What's that? - That face.	4	11
You're the most hirable man on Madison Avenue.	4	11
I'm not at that point yet.	4	11
Okay.	4	11
- Where's Trudy? - Her mother's got her all worked up.	4	11
She made such a stink. And that thing's at least another day away.	4	11
Can I see her?	4	11
Have you been drinking?	4	11
You need to calm down.	4	11
I was at a ballgame when Trudy was born.	4	11
Go about your business.	4	11
Are you all right?	4	11
Could I speak with you candidly?	4	11
Always. I'd like to think	4	11
I'm more to you than a typical father-in-law.	4	11
You are. That's the problem. It's about business.	4	11
There's no business in here, son.	4	11
We may have lost lucky strike.	4	11
I'm sure this agency was a thrill,	4	11
But you've had your folly.	4	11
That's not right, Tom.	4	11
I haven't stayed at Vick chemical for 28 years because I love it.	4	11
It's because I have a family. Any minute here, you will too.	4	11
- This still can work. - ?'m not rooting against you.	4	11
You've got my account, for God's sake.	4	11
It's just...	4	11
You're a frequent topic at c. G.C.	4	11
Apparently you were a tough act to follow	4	11
- When we moved Clearasil over there. - Ted Chaough?	4	11
- ? hate him. - He's a good guy.	4	11
He's not interested in me. He's just trying to hobble don.	4	11
There's no reward in going down with the ship.	4	11
I have an agency. I'm a partner.	4	11
I found him.	4	11
He was down at the candy machines dozed off.	4	11
- Can I see her? - No.	4	11
She finally went to sleep.	4	11
Why don't you just go back	4	11
To the candy machines and we'll wait?	4	11
I'm sorry about that.	4	11
The air conditioning guy's supposed to be there at 8:00.	4	11
I guess I'll see you then.	4	11
You don't want me to go?	4	11
I want you to do whatever you usually do.	4	11
Hey, I don't usually do anything.	4	11
- Really? - Can't you tell by how badly I'm leaving?	4	11
I'm not letting you leave.	4	11
What about your air?	4	11
You're unbelievable.	4	11
I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.	4	11
- Hello? - ? just walked out of there.	4	11
It's over.	4	11
- ? see. - Since his father got sick,	4	11
The board took over. There's no point in talking to them.	4	11
He said we did good work.	4	11
Our clients need to hear this from us.	4	11
I know, Bert. Don't wait for me.	4	11
I'm standing by Lee's receptionist.	4	11
I didn't want to have to pay for the long-distance call.	4	11
Very well then.	4	11
Lane Pryce isn't coming back.	4	11
That's my guess.	4	11
I think they'd do that in a memo.	4	11
I got $5 that says Cooper's retiring.	4	11
No champagne?	4	11
I'd say he's got cancer.	4	11
It's in bigger print now.	4	11
Everyone? ?f we could have your attention, please?	4	11
- Bert. - Ahem.	4	11
"""we have called this meeting of our nearest and dearest"""	4	11
To let you know of a change in the agency.	4	11
After 30 years of consummate service,	4	11
American tobacco has reluctantly decided	4	11
To consolidate their business	4	11
"""At batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn."""	4	11
Damn it.	4	11
"""so what does this mean to you?"	4	11
"Partner, creative director."""	4	11
Pete Campbell and Ken Cosgrove	4	11
Will handle calls to clients.	4	11
Those are the only calls we want made with this news.	4	11
Now we've had a pretty good year.	4	11
We've gained more accounts	4	11
Than we've lost, a lot more,	4	11
Because our work is thoughtful and effective...	4	11
Even lucky strike said so...	4	11
Which means that nothing should change.	4	11
Nothing will change.	4	11
We're gonna push ourselves shoulder to shoulder	4	11
And we're gonna overcome this and succeed tenfold	4	11
And it will be exhilarating.	4	11
Joe?	4	11
As don said, nothing is going to change.	4	11
There's only a small modification in policy.	4	11
Anything out of the ordinary	4	11
Must be approved by myself, Joan Harris or lane Pryce.	4	11
That said,	4	11
Inquiries as to paychecks and advances...	4	11
- What's going on? - That's the head of accounting.	4	11
What do you think's going on?	4	11
Any questions?	4	11
Nothing?	4	11
Okay. If you want to talk to me individually,	4	11
I'll be in my office.	4	11
- What happened? - We lost lucky strike.	4	11
Jesus.	4	11
But it sounds like everything's under control.	4	11
I've got to go to a meeting.	4	11
Peggy, Freddy, Danny, Stan... in my office.	4	11
We're in some trouble here.	4	11
Creative needs to be on its toes.	4	11
"Is it a ""last hired, last fired"" sort of thing?"	4	11
You're in this room. That's all I can say.	4	11
Now myself and the other partners	4	11
Will be out there beating the bushes for new business,	4	11
But creative's job is to hold on to what we have.	4	11
That means client's ideas should seem better than they normally do.	4	11
For the next few weeks the only words you know	4	11
"- Are ""yes, sir."" - Yes, sir."	4	11
That means, Stan, you babysit that Samsonite shoot every day.	4	11
Peggy, the Playtex presentation is still set for tomorrow.	4	11
I'll bring in my notes. I can prep you in 10 minutes.	4	11
No. You're still gonna do it.	4	11
It'll look desperate if I'm suddenly involved.	4	11
- So what about it then? - Be successful.	4	11
I'm not worried.	4	11
Okay. Let's skip the gossip out there.	4	11
Get to work.	4	11
Peggy?	4	11
You're not worried?	4	11
I don-t know. You seem to have everything in hand.	4	11
Should I be worried?	4	11
We don't even know how bad this is gonna be	4	11
Until lane shows up.	4	11
Every time something good happens,	4	11
Something bad happens. I knew I'd pay for it.	4	11
You're not paying for anything.	4	11
But I'm counting on you.	4	11
Close that, will you?	4	11
- Joan Harris. - Joanie, I'm glad you're there.	4	11
I'm so sorry.	4	11
I feel so guilty.	4	11
It's not your fault.	4	11
I need to see you.	4	11
I need you to come down here.	4	11
I'm not flying to Raleigh.	4	11
- When do you get back? - No, I'm here.	4	11
What are you talking about?	4	11
Mr. Cooper said he spoke with you.	4	11
He did, but I didn't go.	4	11
Damn it, Roger. Get on a plane.	4	11
You're very persuasive in person.	4	11
There's no point.	4	11
It's been over for weeks. Garner was supposed to give me a month.	4	11
The bastard couldn't keep to it.	4	11
You knew about it?	4	11
I can't believe you. We could've done something.	4	11
Don't yell at me. You know what it's been like	4	11
Walking around with this? I got a hole in my gut.	4	11
What am I supposed to do with this information?	4	11
I'm sorry.	4	11
But I need you to know why I need you to see you.	4	11
You should've told me.	4	11
Why didn't you tell me?	4	11
I kept meaning to say something.	4	11
I thought I still had time. I don't know.	4	11
I should go. There's a lot of work to do.	4	11
Come after work.	4	11
I'm at the Statler.	4	11
I had to stay away from midtown.	4	11
I'll have to see.	4	11
I think my setup is good,	4	11
But don always has these little examples at the end	4	11
That explain to the client how big the idea is.	4	11
They're always kind of poetic.	4	11
So get don to write it. We can't lose this.	4	11
Since when do we have donuts?	4	11
Condemned man always gets his choice of a last meal.	4	11
You know what Pete Campbell just said to me?	4	11
He said if anybody sends a resume out of here,	4	11
- They're gonna get executed. - Fellas, we're on an account right now.	4	11
Playtex gloves protect a woman's hands	4	11
So they're soft enough to touch	4	11
All the things a woman wants to touch.	4	11
All the things?	4	11
The exciting things she wants to feel	4	11
With her fingertips.	4	11
His lips.	4	11
The tuft of hair on his chest.	4	11
The small of his back.	4	11
I can't imagine don saying that.	4	11
Excuse me. I have a delivery for Peggy Olson.	4	11
- What? - Are you Peggy Olson? It's c. O.D.	4	11
Let me get my purse.	4	11
Go ahead without me. I'm gonna take care of this and then practice.	4	11
Am I wrong or is she giving it off?	4	11
Well, it's the last days of Rome.	4	11
I was in an agency that went down.	4	11
The women get sex-crazed.	4	11
The energy is very good.	4	11
They said they wanted to revise the media plan,	4	11
But I think what they really wanted was a budget	4	11
To see how much of their money we haven't spent yet.	4	11
- Who are we talking about? - Birds-eye.	4	11
Why are we worrying about existing accounts?	4	11
If anything, they're going to get more attention.	4	11
Because they're afraid we won't be here.	4	11
I have news from London.	4	11
Pete, wake up.	4	11
Lane thinks our billings are probably around $22 million without lucky,	4	11
But he has to look at everything in person.	4	11
When's he coming?	4	11
As soon as he can.	4	11
David Montgomery's memorial is tomorrow afternoon.	4	11
In case we need cheering up?	4	11
The man was senior vice president of accounts	4	11
At the #4 agency.	4	11
There's gonna be a lot of vulnerable clients in attendance.	4	11
- ? think Roger knew him. - Sorry to interrupt.	4	11
- ?t's Al Weaver from glo-coat. - What does he want?	4	11
- ? don't know. - Do you want me on the call?	4	11
Didn't you talk with him this morning?	4	11
No.	4	11
- Al, how are you? - Hello, don.	4	11
I'm glad I could reach you. I just wanted to let you know	4	11
We appreciate everything you've done for us,	4	11
But we've decided to take the account in a different direction.	4	11
- All right, Al... - ? want you to know it wasn't an easy decision.	4	11
- Now can I talk? - Sure.	4	11
I don't think you understand what's happened here.	4	11
And I'm not talking about losing lucky strike.	4	11
- Lucky strike didn't enter into it. - Really?	4	11
So that has nothing to do with this?	4	11
Don, it's a simple coincidence that it happened now.	4	11
Okay, you're right. It is bad timing.	4	11
How can you blame us for wanting to move on?	4	11
Because that commercial, that little cowboy kid,	4	11
Was the first successful strategy you've been near	4	11
Since you sponsored fibber McGee and Molly. We won the Clio!	4	11
- You won the Clio. - With work we did for you!	4	11
With your direction!	4	11
Believe me, we know how it looks,	4	11
But it's just business, plain and simple.	4	11
I'm coming out there. We're gonna talk about this in person.	4	11
I'm sorry, don. The decision's been made.	4	11
I just thought you should hear it from me.	4	11
You know we're gonna want another shot at this soon.	4	11
As long as you're around.	4	11
We'll be here. Don't worry.	4	11
Good luck, don.	4	11
I hope we can work together again sometime.	4	11
- Okay. - Goodbye.	4	11
Goodbye.	4	11
What was that?	4	11
Nothing.	4	11
- Do you want ice? - No, but I need a favor.	4	11
- Make sure I don't overdo it. - Okay.	4	11
How do I... um, it's hard to tell with you.	4	11
Stop me at three. This is one.	4	11
The doctor says they never let the labor go past two sunsets.	4	11
What exactly is the problem?	4	11
Apparently Trudy's pelvis is too small	4	11
And the baby's shoulders can't get through.	4	11
- They should cut it out. - They don't like to start there.	4	11
Go to the hospital. There's nothing to do here.	4	11
- ?t's obviously what matters to you. - What?	4	11
I don't know what the hell you said to them this morning.	4	11
So, Joan, that puts us at what? 20 million and change?	4	11
Are you doubting my efforts?	4	11
All you had to do was tell them everything was fine.	4	11
You think that call's easy to make?	4	11
I think you're distracted.	4	11
Because of that, I think you scared the shit out of'em.	4	11
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?	4	11
Don't blow a gasket.	4	11
He called looking for me and my secretary told him where I was.	4	11
Incredible.	4	11
That was something else.	4	11
There he is... the man of the hour.	4	11
Ted. How considerate of you to stop by.	4	11
I wish the baby was here already,	4	11
But I'm sure everyone feels that way.	4	11
Good news is always worth waiting for.	4	11
Don't let your vanity get the best of you.	4	11
There is nothing wrong with being called grandma.	4	11
It's a rattle. You can get it engraved.	4	11
Ogilvy sent me one when my son was born.	4	11
Thank you. What do you want, Ted?	4	11
No, this is about what you want.	4	11
I mean, you're about to have everything	4	11
The minute that baby comes.	4	11
You know your father-in-law never stops talking about you?	4	11
He doesn't know the half of it.	4	11
You've brought in a little business since you went out on your own...	4	11
Glo-coat, life cereal,	4	11
Sugarberry hams, Vick chemical obviously,	4	11
Mountain dew, Fillmore auto, birds-eye, ponds?	4	11
I didn't do all that by myself.	4	11
Pete, as far as I'm concerned, you're what's missing from c. G.C.	4	11
Jim cutler's due to retire.	4	11
"""Campbell, Gleason & Chaough""?"	4	11
Has a nice ring to it.	4	11
Wouldn't you want your name first?	4	11
I'm open to it if we're having that discussion.	4	11
You'll have a full voting third.	4	11
I'm not don.	4	11
It's not the wild West.	4	11
We just got Alfa romeo... little Italian sports car.	4	11
I don't know if you've heard of it, but I think you'll really enjoy driving one.	4	11
- ? don't drive. - ?'ll teach you.	4	11
Tom, Jeannie, my offer still stands.	4	11
If you want a hotel room, I can get you one across the street.	4	11
Roger. I let you come over	4	11
Because you said you needed to talk. We can talk.	4	11
- Joanie, I need you. - Stop it,	4	11
Or we can talk on the phone.	4	11
Is that what you sleep in now?	4	11
What do you want? I'm exhausted!	4	11
I waited for you at the hotel.	4	11
- Why didn't you come? Are you mad at me? - No.	4	11
Roger, I can't do this anymore.	4	11
You always say that.	4	11
- Then you come back to me because we belong together. - Don't do that.	4	11
I need you right now.	4	11
Because I'm a port in a storm?	4	11
No. Because I feel like shit and you care about me.	4	11
I'm not a solution to your problems.	4	11
I'm another problem.	4	11
Are you serious?	4	11
I can't do this anymore.	4	11
You'll change your mind. You'll see.	4	11
I'm sorry.	4	11
I just can't do this anymore.	4	11
So what are you trying to say?	4	11
Roger.	4	11
So that night we got mugged,	4	11
That was the last time?	4	11
Wish I'd known that.	4	11
God, I'd think this place would be packed still.	4	11
It's 8:00.	4	11
There's only so much we can pretend like we're doing.	4	11
- Are you okay? - You want something?	4	11
I'd rather eat, but that's me.	4	11
I'm one over for the day.	4	11
See that?	4	11
I kissed you and it got quiet.	4	11
- How'd it go? - ?t was...	4	11
Miserable.	4	11
Clients are running scared.	4	11
I'm used to having my ideas rejected, not me.	4	11
How do you do it?	4	11
My job is to present facts.	4	11
If they're unhappy with the agency, it's not my problem.	4	11
Who's unhappy?	4	11
Come on. Clients are always unhappy.	4	11
Like who?	4	11
- Are you kidding? - No.	4	11
Why? I'm drowning here.	4	11
You know I can't do that.	4	11
If a client is unhappy, they're unhappy.	4	11
There's nothing against telling them to have dinner with me.	4	11
If you don't want to, tell me who they are. I'll call'em out of the blue.	4	11
I can't do that.	4	11
Sure you can. Who'll know?	4	11
The standard of ethics this business is low enough.	4	11
God knows I've done some things I'm not proud of,	4	11
But those other agencies pay me.	4	11
What about protecting the clients?	4	11
So I'm gonna kill my business to save yours?	4	11
It's not your business. It's Atherton's. This is different.	4	11
- This is everything to me. - ? don't believe this.	4	11
You want a shoulder to cry on, fine.	4	11
You want to throw me to the wolves so you can save your neck, forget it.	4	11
- ? would do it for you. - ? would never ask.	4	11
I would never use you like that	4	11
Because I know the difference	4	11
Between what we have and this stupid office.	4	11
Mr. Cosgrove says Playtex just left the hotel.	4	11
Thank you.	4	11
God, I'm so nervous.	4	11
You need to relax.	4	11
I can't do this drunk.	4	11
I know a technique	4	11
That can really take the nerves away.	4	11
I learned it from a yogi.	4	11
- Show me. - Close your eyes.	4	11
Take a deep breath.	4	11
Fill your lungs until you can't anymore.	4	11
Stick out your stomach.	4	11
Now release it in a cool stream right in my face.	4	11
Hey! What are you doing?	4	11
You said you wanted to relax, so...	4	11
- Let's relax. - Stan, no.	4	11
Oh, come on. You're so horny I can smell it on your breath.	4	11
Stan, knock it off.	4	11
Hey, I saw you with the delivery boy yesterday.	4	11
What? He's my boyfriend.	4	11
Oh, come on, baby. It's the end of the world.	4	11
Why do you keep making me reject you?	4	11
I was trying to do you a favor.	4	11
Well, thank you. I'm not anxious anymore.	4	11
- Should I get the door? - No. It didn't get any worse.	4	11
What exactly did he say?	4	11
He said they were terrified about the British	4	11
Banning cigarette ads from TV and they need to cut costs.	4	11
Maybe it's a good time to get out of this business.	4	11
That's crap. Sales were up 10%.	4	11
You do what you can do.	4	11
David Montgomery's memorial is in 40 minutes	4	11
- At the River club. - David Montgomery died?	4	11
Well, there's your silver lining.	4	11
Who the hell wants to go to that?	4	11
We're trying to get new accounts.	4	11
- Remember how to do that? - You wanna dogpile on me?	4	11
Saving that account was impossible.	4	11
Because you ignored it!	4	11
One damn account and you ignored it.	4	11
You don't know what you're talking about. Pete, explain it to him.	4	11
You squeezed me off of it, Roger.	4	11
You wanted it all to yourself.	4	11
He would have never let this happen.	4	11
But you do what you can do which is nothing.	4	11
Hey. You're the one who dragged me into your amateur hour.	4	11
I was perfectly happy where I was.	4	11
Why did I do it? Out of friendship.	4	11
But now that the account's gone, I guess that went with it.	4	11
Get out of here, all of you. Go Chase a hearse.	4	11
Sorry to interrupt.	4	11
Mr. Campbell, your father-in-law called.	4	11
Your wife and your daughter are resting comfortably.	4	11
Oh. Just now?	4	11
Yes, it happened. You've got a baby girl.	4	11
- Congratulations. - Good job.	4	11
Thank you, Megan.	4	11
- Okay, we should get going. - Let me get my coat.	4	11
Where does draper get off?	4	11
Lee garner Jr. Never took you seriously	4	11
Because you never took yourself seriously.	4	11
- Are you ready? - Mmm.	4	11
No hard feelings?	4	11
None at all.	4	11
Everything good?	4	11
Absolutely.	4	11
And so I think about that night...	4	11
Staring out the window of that Detroit hotel room,	4	11
Knowing we were going home with Buick	4	11
And saying to David,	4	11
"""is this the best thing we're ever going to do?"""	4	11
Lynn, it was your fifth birthday.	4	11
The next day when we were in the airport,	4	11
He showed me this pendant he'd bought the day before downtown.	4	11
As he closed the box, he said,	4	11
"""Crosby, that's the best thing I'll ever do."""	4	11
I know it's hard,	4	11
But Dave loved you more than anything, sweetheart.	4	11
That's Stu Carlsbad from Ralston Purina.	4	11
He's always ripe.	4	11
We have dog food experience.	4	11
I've got him.	4	11
I don't know how prepared I am,	4	11
But Dave was always a fan of winging it.	4	11
Beth, his beautiful wife.	4	11
You were there before he made partner	4	11
And then you gave him to us,	4	11
But you know you and Lynnie	4	11
Were always on his mind.	4	11
True story.	4	11
We'd been in London for three months	4	11
Trying to nail down British petroleum.	4	11
Never happened.	4	11
But once a week he would drag me to Portobello road	4	11
Looking for thimbles for your collection, Lynn.	4	11
Silver thimbles.	4	11
And he was an expert.	4	11
It's because Playtex is strong enough	4	11
To protect a woman's hands.	4	11
Through her fingertips, she can dry the tears of a child	4	11
Or feel the warmth of her husband's skin.	4	11
Playtex protects a woman's touch.	4	11
It's very romantic. I have to admit	4	11
When you first brought it up, I didn't think that was possible for latex gloves.	4	11
These images are about the moments	4	11
After the housework is over.	4	11
They're about the meaningful life	4	11
A woman leads when work is done.	4	11
Well, I feel pretty good about this.	4	11
Peggy, our pleasure.	4	11
We're thrilled to get this in the first try.	4	11
Well, I'm gonna let you get back to the hotel	4	11
And then steaks and a show.	4	11
That went well.	4	11
You have lipstick all over your teeth.	4	11
What?	4	11
- Why are you still here? - ? didn't know if I should leave or not.	4	11
- How was the funeral? - We'll see.	4	11
Get me the campaign briefs on Ken's accounts	4	11
And then you can go.	4	11
And send Peggy in.	4	11
Miss Olson's gone r the night,	4	11
- But if you need help... - Did you do that?	4	11
I thought in the end you wouldn't want to throw it away.	4	11
You're wrong.	4	11
That commercial was great	4	11
And nothing they do can change that.	4	11
I'll take those.	4	11
Thank you. You can go.	4	11
You sure you don't want some help?	4	11
This is a little complicated.	4	11
That's okay. I'd really like to learn what goes on here.	4	11
Really.	4	11
Well, first of all, I think it would help me	4	11
From making mistakes with your work the way I have.	4	11
And secondly,	4	11
I think I'd like eventually to do what you do	4	11
Or what miss Olson does.	4	11
- ? didn't know that. - Unless you'd rather be alone.	4	11
I don't want to be in the way.	4	11
No. I don't mind.	4	11
This is a strategy statement	4	11
Signed by Fillmore auto parts.	4	11
Copywriters stray from these midstream sometimes	4	11
If they have a better idea,	4	11
But we can't take that chance now.	4	11
Wouldn't clients want a better idea?	4	11
What'd you like about the commercial?	4	11
You're putting me on the spot. Um...	4	11
I know it's a floor wax, but I really remember that feeling	4	11
Of being a little kid	4	11
And feeling like I was being punished when my mother cleaned the house.	4	11
- Where are you from? - Montreal.	4	11
We didn't have glo-coat.	4	11
- Why'd you move here? - Well, first of all, it's New York.	4	11
For an artist, it's mecca.	4	11
You're an artist?	4	11
I wouldn't say I'm an artist.	4	11
I'm an artistic person. I majored in literature	4	11
And I've dabbled in writing and painting	4	11
And a little bit of acting.	4	11
What are you laughing about?	4	11
Because I just realized	4	11
I know everything about you.	4	11
I mean, you're in my head all day,	4	11
Even when I go home. And you don't know anything about me.	4	11
Well, you haven't been here that long.	4	11
And you don't know how long I will be,	4	11
So why get to know me?	4	11
I can see that's what everybody must think.	4	11
You judge people on their work.	4	11
I'm the same way.	4	11
Everything else is sentimental.	4	11
- You want one? - How many is that?	4	11
Four.	4	11
I know you're angry, but I hope you're not afraid	4	11
Because you will get through this.	4	11
You don't know that.	4	11
Why do you care what I think?	4	11
Megan, I don't think this is a good idea.	4	11
This has nothing to do with work.	4	11
I can't make any mistakes right now.	4	11
Let's be clear.	4	11
I'm not gonna run out of here crying tomorrow.	4	11
I just want you right now.	4	11
Hey. Where are you going?	4	11
I'm exhausted.	4	11
How was your day?	4	11
Fine.	4	11
I know how to make it better.	4	11
I'm really tired.	4	11
Sit down.	4	11
What'd you buy?	4	11
Look.	4	11
Look at it.	4	11
Sign it.	4	11
"""to my loving wife."""	4	11
I'm so proud of you.	4	11
You should go first. Actually, I should go first.	4	11
Do you want to grab a bite?	4	11
I want you to go home	4	11
And I want you to sleep.	4	11
And I don't want you drinking any more tonight.	4	11
Wait. Did you want to go first?	4	11
Good night, Mr. Draper.	4	11
Didn't expect to see you here.	4	11
I was gonna call,	4	11
But I didn't want to do this over the phone.	4	11
So you were gonna write it on an envelope.	4	11
Can I come inside?	4	11
I got you a meeting with Heinz.	4	11
It's vinegar, sauces and beans.	4	11
They're at Ketchum Macleod and they're restless.	4	11
- Faye. - ? thought about what you said,	4	11
I thought about you...	4	11
And I thought about... whatever. You are my life right now.	4	11
You didn't have to do this.	4	11
I wanted to.	4	11
Thank you.	4	11
You're welcome.	4	11
Do you wanna stay?	4	11
I'll probably fall asleep on you.	4	11
Just sit with me.	4	11
a?? welcome to my world a??	4	11
a?? won't you come on in? A??	4	11
a?? miracles, I guess a??	4	11
a?? still happen now and then a??	4	11
a?? step into my heart a??	4	11
First, I want to assure you that no one at my agency knows about this meeting.	4	12
-I appreciate that. -I'm here to help.	4	12
I have my own thoughts, but how would you describe your...	4	12
Well, your current frustrations?	4	12
During the war, Heinz was all about beans,	4	12
but now, obviously, ketchup is king.	4	12
I'm happy for the company, but I'm afraid we've become the fading older sister.	4	12
So ketchup, chili sauce and soup end up over at DDB,	4	12
and vinegar, sauces and beans end up at Ketchum MacLeod.	4	12
I don't know why I'm disappointed, I asked for straightforward.	4	12
I just thought they would talk me out of it.	4	12
 They obviously don't know what kind of client you are.	4	12
Well, I've been working a long time.	4	12
I know that despite the public's imagination, food is cyclical.	4	12
I don't mean seasonal.	4	12
But I mean, literally, there's a time for beans, and there's a time for ketchup.	4	12
But I don't have that time, so I wanna force the issue.	4	12
You know, something inventive.	4	12
Humor worked with the pickles, but pickles are funny.	4	12
The way beans are funny, we can't use that. We have to fight it, actually.	4	12
Well, it's very possible that Heinz beans don't need to be funny,	4	12
because they're a food, not a condiment. They're substantial.	4	12
You know, I'd love to have that conversation.	4	12
And the reason I agreed to meet with you is because I hoped it would spark something,	4	12
and maybe six to eight months from now you can call me with a humdinger.	4	12
 How about six days?	4	12
No. No, this is my point.	4	12
I want to move, but there's a lot that goes with it.	4	12
There's a breaking-in period that's months.	4	12
-That's true, but... -I'm sorry to be so blunt,	4	12
but I don't know that your company will be here in six months.	4	12
I do.	4	12
That's what I'm hoping.	4	12
"That's why my answer is not ""No,"" it's just ""Not now."""	4	12
So where's the harm in coming in and hearing some ideas?	4	12
Because I can't afford to move my business a third time in two years.	4	12
I just can't.	4	12
I see.	4	12
So, that's where we are.	4	12
Hold on.	4	12
Raymond, I will have an exciting idea. I happen to know that.	4	12
Would a discounted commission make up for the break-in period?	4	12
I bet I could get a date with your mother right now.	4	12
Well, you can see why I don't want to let this go.	4	12
Look, Don, you're a hell of an idea man, but let the account boys do this part.	4	12
I wish you the best of luck.	4	12
Thank you. It was really great to meet you.	4	12
Excuse me, waiter.	4	12
Sally, Bobby!	4	12
You're filthy.	4	12
Can I take it away from him?	4	12
The spoon or the screaming, take your pick.	4	12
I want two hot dogs.	4	12
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach.	4	12
How come we never eat with Henry?	4	12
"First of all, he works until late and you're always saying, ""I'm hungry."""	4	12
Second of all, you don't eat the same food.	4	12
I'll try new food.	4	12
Would you like to eat with Henry?	4	12
Why don't Bobby and Gene eat first, and I'll wait to eat with you and Henry?	4	12
Okay. Let me think about it.	4	12
Okay.	4	12
You're paying me to assess your situation,	4	12
but I could've told you from three blocks away	4	12
that signing new business, no matter what the size, is of the essence.	4	12
Not only because your billings have shrunk by 50%,	4	12
but because there's not much time before you'll be perceived as stagnant,	4	12
or worse, decaying.	4	12
Listen, Doctor, we know there's a black spot on the x-ray.	4	12
You don't have to Keep tapping your finger on it.	4	12
I recommend that you do what you do best, cigarettes.	4	12
You understand the FTC. You understand the Surgeon General.	4	12
You have a team in place with account management	4	12
and media expertise which is up and running.	4	12
And, of course, you have Don.	4	12
You are a certain kind of girl, and tobacco is your ideal boyfriend.	4	12
Can you get us a date?	4	12
Philip Morris is introducing a new brand for young women,	4	12
hoping to have it on the market in 18 months,	4	12
and they'd like a new agency on it from the ground floor.	4	12
How much is it?	4	12
Close to $5 million.	4	12
It's a start.	4	12
Wonderful.	4	12
And what stage of the process has your influence bought us?	4	12
A meeting. No one else has one.	4	12
We will listen more than we will speak.	4	12
Like a good girlfriend.	4	12
Sounds great.	4	12
I concur.	4	12
All I'm saying is we should be going after something as big as what we had.	4	12
It'd cost a fortune to pursue one when it's in review.	4	12
And they're impossible to pry away.	4	12
Our day-to-day payroll will be beyond us by the next billing cycle.	4	12
We should start thinking about reducing staff	4	12
and subletting the square footage.	4	12
Why even have an office? Why don't we just work out of a cab?	4	12
And where does that leave me?	4	12
Trying to get my calls returned with all the buying power of Secor Laxative?	4	12
We gave him Don and a finder's fee. He should've aimed higher.	4	12
I just left Geyer for this.	4	12
Do you think those clients are in love with me?	4	12
I'm getting married in October! It's gonna be barefoot in the park.	4	12
These things go in streaks.	4	12
And Don Draper with a cigarette company?	4	12
We get this vote of confidence, and we move from there.	4	12
Marlboro was their women's cigarette.	4	12
Well, they certainly ran away from that in the right direction.	4	12
You know, beans, vinegars and sauces was very impressed.	4	12
Thank you for that, but thank you much more for this.	4	12
This is what I was hoping for.	4	12
Good. Geoff's excited.	4	12
Study up.	4	12
I have dinner plans but call me tonight, even if it's just to work.	4	12
It's a summer practice helmet. it's not as good.	4	12
It smells.	4	12
Well, you're there all the time. What do you talk about?	4	12
Didn't you go?	4	12
Yeah, but psychiatrists are easy to fool.	4	12
Dr. Edna's smart.	4	12
She tell you to kiss your mom's ass?	4	12
No.	4	12
So who's smarter, me or her?	4	12
You want one?	4	12
No.	4	12
Do you talk to your mom about me?	4	12
I did, and I don't anymore.	4	12
She doesn't like me. She thinks...	4	12
She doesn't like kids.	4	12
That's not true.	4	12
You're the one who's always saying how mean she is.	4	12
So what?	4	12
-I've gotta go. -Okay.	4	12
See you later, alligator.	4	12
Don.	4	12
Midge.	4	12
I just came out from a meeting at a magazine related to Time Life	4	12
and I saw this dashing figure.	4	12
Where are you going with so much purpose?	4	12
Home. You look good.	4	12
I'm skinny. Starving artist.	4	12
-Did you move here? -Yes.	4	12
Well, I have my own firm now.	4	12
Draper, Draper and Draper?	4	12
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.	4	12
Well, it sounds impressive.	4	12
There are good days and bad days, like anything else.	4	12
So you wouldn't happen to need any freelance artists, would you?	4	12
I wish I could help right now. Maybe in six months.	4	12
You can use me as a reference.	4	12
Really?	4	12
I thought I would've run into you in The Village.	4	12
I'm always expecting to see you in the park.	4	12
What are you doing in The Village? Admiring the wildlife?	4	12
I live there, on Waverly.	4	12
Yeah.	4	12
So what's the rush to go home? Come over.	4	12
I have a big meeting tomorrow. Maybe some other time.	4	12
Not even to meet my husband?	4	12
-Really? -Well, it's not romantic.	4	12
We just got married for the bread.	4	12
We'll eat, you'll buy a painting, I'll cheer you up.	4	12
Look, I lost my purse. At least give me a ride downtown.	4	12
Okay.	4	12
I told her I brushed my teeth, but she said I still smelled like spaghetti.	4	12
And what did you do?	4	12
I brushed my teeth again.	4	12
And what did she do?	4	12
She doesn't care what the truth is as long as I do what she says.	4	12
Got any sevens?	4	12
Nope. Go fish.	4	12
I hate sevens.	4	12
Why?	4	12
I just do.	4	12
You know, I'm very proud of how you found a way to behave so well,	4	12
even when you get so angry at your mother sometimes.	4	12
It's hard to control ourselves when we get so angry.	4	12
She just doesn't know that I'm mad.	4	12
As long as you know it.	4	12
I told you your mom acts that way because she has stresses.	4	12
Not because you're bad or that you did anything wrong.	4	12
I know.	4	12
Do you have any aces?	4	12
No, go fish.	4	12
So now that you're back in school,	4	12
we probably should be seeing a little less of each other.	4	12
Just one day a week.	4	12
So that you can ride your bike,	4	12
and be with your friends and be in the ballet recital.	4	12
Okay.	4	12
Do you have any threes?	4	12
I said I'm very proud of you. Did you hear that?	4	12
Do you have any jacks?	4	12
Perry, we have company.	4	12
This is my friend, Don.	4	12
Perry. Nice to meet you.	4	12
-Sorry to drop in, -Oh, no.	4	12
Why don't you offer Don a drink?	4	12
Sure. Don, what are you gonna have?	4	12
I have vodka or brown?	4	12
Whiskey's good.	4	12
Good. Good.	4	12
I'll get a couple of glasses.	4	12
So you're a playwright?	4	12
When we met, I said he looked like Brendan Behan.	4	12
You said Dylan Thomas.	4	12
Here we go.	4	12
To welcome company.	4	12
Let me go freshen up and make sure we have toilet paper.	4	12
So, Don, let me open your eyes for a minute. Come here.	4	12
Can you believe this?	4	12
-What's it called? -Number four	4	12
The whole thing is about what she sees when she closes her eyes.	4	12
It's part of this thing that she's doing. It's called an afterimage.	4	12
What's more real?	4	12
It's nice.	4	12
You know, I have a price list somewhere.	4	12
Of course, you know, whatever you're willing to pay.	4	12
I mean, I Know she'd love for you to have one.	4	12
Let me think about it.	4	12
You know, it's not hard to see things are a little tough around here,	4	12
but she digs you.	4	12
And I could tell you she'd do anything if you bought one.	4	12
Are you sure about that?	4	12
We're not possessive,	4	12
and you should've heard how excited she was when she tracked you down.	4	12
What?	4	12
You know, the look on her face when she walked in here with you.	4	12
See, I knew I shouldn't have left you two alone.	4	12
Are you kidding? We're getting along famously.	4	12
You know what?	4	12
I'm gonna get some groceries and whip up a great meal.	4	12
Midge? Honey?	4	12
She lost her purse.	4	12
Right.	4	12
Don, don't.	4	12
My father owned a restaurant. I can make chicken cordon bleu.	4	12
Here. How about that?	4	12
$107	4	12
Well, okay.	4	12
You two sit tight. I'll be right back.	4	12
-He's very interesting. -He's an idiot.	4	12
He's just gonna go out and put that in his arm.	4	12
And you could've gotten so much more from me.	4	12
That's why you tracked me down, like James Bond.	4	12
God! He's such an idiot.	4	12
I just wanted you to buy a painting.	4	12
I swear.	4	12
What's it like?	4	12
It's like drinking 100 bottles of whiskey	4	12
while someone licks your tits.	4	12
I can see it's very good.	4	12
He said it would help me take my mind off my work.	4	12
Turns out, it's a full-time job.	4	12
Why don't you stop?	4	12
I know it's bad for me, but...	4	12
It's heroin, Don.	4	12
I just can't stop.	4	12
I am glad to see you, you know?	4	12
This is $300.	4	12
You know, for Number four over there.	4	12
Don.	4	12
What am I gonna do with a check?	4	12
Here's $120 in cash.	4	12
Do you think my work's any good?	4	12
Does it matter?	4	12
You know, I don't even have car fare.	4	12
You can walk across the park. Do some advertising for me.	4	12
Like a sandwich board.	4	12
It's really great to see you, Don.	4	12
I'm glad you haven't changed.	4	12
It was the way he slammed the car door like that.	4	12
It was so dismissive.	4	12
It reminded me of Don, but, of course, it wasn't.	4	12
When I confronted him later, it turned out he hadn't heard me.	4	12
That's what he said, anyway.	4	12
Well, you learned something, didn't you?	4	12
I did.	4	12
Our time is almost up,	4	12
so I thought that I should tell you that	4	12
I believe Sally has made wonderful progress,	4	12
and that I'd like to reduce her sessions to once a week and see where we are.	4	12
So she's cured?	4	12
She's not better. She ran away.	4	12
And she understands what she did was wrong,	4	12
and she's been very responsible since.	4	12
Her life is chaotic,	4	12
and I'm afraid of losing this influence.	4	12
I've noticed that every time you come in here,	4	12
you have many things on your mind.	4	12
And I feel that you should have your own time	4	12
where you get to say everything you want to say.	4	12
I have a very talented colleague, Dr. Evelyn Shapiro, whom I can recommend.	4	12
Why can't I talk to you?	4	12
Betty, you can talk to me but, you know,	4	12
I'm a child psychiatrist.	4	12
Well, I don't need a psychiatrist. I just...	4	12
Obviously, I'm willing to do whatever you recommend as Sally progresses.	4	12
And I would hope, of course,	4	12
that if she continues to make progress, that we could continue to discuss that.	4	12
Of course.	4	12
So I'll keep you in the books for next month.	4	12
If you think so.	4	12
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.	4	12
Red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather.	4	12
-You wanted to see me? -I did.	4	12
-Did you do all the reading? -Yes.	4	12
If strategy comes up, and it usually doesn't at this point,	4	12
what do you think they think the strength is of this product?	4	12
Well, as you know, it's pointless to get women to switch from men's brands.	4	12
Nobody switches.	4	12
They're probably looking for a new way to give them out for free.	4	12
Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Draper, Dr. Atherton is on his way up,	4	12
the partners are gathering in the lobby,	4	12
"and Dr. Miller called to say, ""Break a leg."""	4	12
Thank you.	4	12
What were you saying?	4	12
I was saying you're gonna do great.	4	12
Morning.	4	12
I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news.	4	12
They canceled the meeting.	4	12
-Are you kidding me? -What?	4	12
They decided to give it to Leo Burnett.	4	12
Burnett has Marlboro already.	4	12
I thought they wanted a fresh start with this.	4	12
So did I.	4	12
They're excited to see where you are in six months.	4	12
Six months means never. They're letting us die.	4	12
I thought this was a sure thing.	4	12
Down the road, perhaps.	4	12
There's no reason to be discouraged.	4	12
The wind is blowing ice cold out there.	4	12
We can't even get a meeting with a damn tobacco account!	4	12
Take it inside.	4	12
You're an asshole, you know that?	4	12
Mr. Crane, out.	4	12
They can't even dignify us with an excuse?	4	12
They don't need an excuse.	4	12
It's because we're desperate. They can smell it on us.	4	12
We reek of it like some sweaty salesman knocking on his last door!	4	12
Because we're going after scraps.	4	12
What about United Airlines, General Motors?	4	12
-Do you think that's easier? -Then what? You have a plan?	4	12
I'm out there beating the bushes every day for anything.	4	12
-You should try it. -Just out of caution, I met with the bank.	4	12
They've agreed to extend our line of credit,	4	12
but they would like us to post some collateral.	4	12
You went to the bank? There's a vote of confidence.	4	12
$100,000 each from the senior partners,	4	12
and $50,000 from Mr. Campbell and I would buy us six months or so,	4	12
provided we make a drastic reduction in staff.	4	12
$50,000? Absolutely not.	4	12
It's an obligation of your contract.	4	12
All we need is a bridge to cold and flu season	4	12
and Vicks will take us to the holidays.	4	12
Sugarberry Hams will pick up. Samsonite...	4	12
It's a hardship for me as well, but it's a necessity.	4	12
We should move. We should never have been here.	4	12
You think we look desperate now?	4	12
Well, if you figure it out, you Know where to find me.	4	12
For a little while, anyway.	4	12
And then I was floating over town. Standing straight up, not like Superman.	4	12
Only it wasn't Ossining, it was London. Like Mary Poppins.	4	12
Do you want the backwash?	4	12
I fly in some of my dreams. It feels like being in the ocean.	4	12
I just felt like I was going to heaven, except I don't believe in it.	4	12
You don't? Then what happens when you die? Nothing?	4	12
It doesn't really bother me, except for it's forever.	4	12
When I think about forever, I get upset.	4	12
Like the Land O' Lakes butter has that Indian girl, sitting, holding a box.	4	12
And it has a picture of her on it, holding a box.	4	12
With a picture of her on it, holding a box.	4	12
Have you ever noticed that?	4	12
I wish you wouldn't have said that.	4	12
Sorry. I have to go.	4	12
Yeah, I should, too.	4	12
I'll save my Fritos for you.	4	12
-May I speak with you? -Are you busy?	4	12
No. Do you want one?	4	12
No.	4	12
Philip Morris set up the meeting, then told Leo Burnett about it	4	12
to leverage a sweeter deal.	4	12
So they used us. Is that supposed to make me feel better?	4	12
Everyone at Burnett is already bragging about how we never even got a meeting.	4	12
What do you want?	4	12
I wanna know why I'm being punished for being the only business left around here-	4	12
We're all being punished.	4	12
I don't have that kind of money.	4	12
Pete, I'm doing everything I can. Get me in a room.	4	12
-Miss Olson to see you. -Come in!	4	12
Everybody's waiting in the conference room.	4	12
For what?	4	12
Well, we were all gonna leave when you left, but you didn't go, so what should we do?	4	12
-I don't care. -What happened?	4	12
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.	4	12
What are we gonna do?	4	12
Peggy, it's not your problem.	4	12
I know, but I have been thinking about the company,	4	12
and I was wondering what you thought about...	4	12
You know, why don't we just change our name?	4	12
If this was a dog food, we'd change the name.	4	12
We can't start over. We just started.	4	12
"You always say, ""if you don't like what they're saying about you,"	4	12
"-""change the conversation."" -To what?"	4	12
What they're saying about us is true.	4	12
So there's nothing we can do?	4	12
Sure there is. We're gonna sit at our desks and keep typing	4	12
while the walls fall down around us, because we're creative.	4	12
The least important most important thing there is.	4	12
You can't slam the door like that.	4	12
Why didn't you call me back? The bank called.	4	12
Something about a loan application?	4	12
-They called here? -Yes.	4	12
Do you have something you want to tell me?	4	12
It's not important.	4	12
To think you still want to surprise me after five years of marriage.	4	12
When can I start looking? I'm so in love with Greenwich.	4	12
We're not buying a house, Trudy.	4	12
The partners each need to put in a lump sum to keep the payroll we have going,	4	12
so people don't lose their jobs.	4	12
What? How much?	4	12
Well, it's $50,000, and we have $22,000 in the bank,	4	12
not counting the baby gifts, which will remain for the baby.	4	12
It's all for the baby, for Tammy to have a yard to run around in.	4	12
Central Park was good enough for me.	4	12
When you bet big and lose, you don't double down.	4	12
It's in my contract. I'll lose my partnership.	4	12
You'll lose your stateroom on the Titanic?	4	12
You are forbidden to give anything more to that company.	4	12
You don't get to forbid me.	4	12
Lower your voice!	4	12
And don't even think about asking my father.	4	12
"”Why I'm quitting tobacco."""	4	12
"""Recently, my advertising agency"	4	12
”ended a long relationship with Lucky Strike cigarettes.	4	12
"""And i'm relieved."	4	12
”For over 25 years, we devoted ourselves to peddling a product	4	12
”for which good work is irrelevant,	4	12
”because people can't stop themselves from buying it.	4	12
”The product that never improves,	4	12
”causes illness and makes people unhappy.	4	12
”But there was money in it.	4	12
"""A lot of money."	4	12

”We knew it wasn't good for us, but we couldn't stop.	4	12
"""And then, when Lucky Strike moved their business elsewhere,"	4	12

-Good morning, Don. -Stan.	4	12
Good morning.	4	12
Good morning. Any calls?	4	12
Yes, quite a few. Mostly reporters and citizens, Dr. Miller.	4	12
Anyone else?	4	12
Someone named Emerson Foote and people from those agencies you mentioned.	4	12
They're looking for you.	4	12
Can you get Dr. Miller?	4	12
Somebody used your name to end our business in the newspaper.	4	12
-it's not you, is it? -It's suicide!	4	12
It's insane! How the hell could you do this? Why would you do this?	4	12
Because someone had to do something.	4	12
You put the company name on it. You should've consulted us.	4	12
Why? To evaluate its strengths and weaknesses?	4	12
To knock it down to risk versus reward? It's done!	4	12
And I slept last night for the first time in a month.	4	12
You slept? Really?	4	12
You weren't smiling, thinking about the taste of shit	4	12
that would be in everybody's mouth over breakfast today?	4	12
No one asked you to euthanize this company.	4	12
What did you expect, for us to pat you on the back?	4	12
Don't you realize the clients are all going to think	4	12
you could turn on them at any minute?	4	12
I'm not going to explain to you what I did. It's an ad for this agency.	4	12
If you don't understand it, then you shouldn't be in this business.	4	12
You humiliated us by not putting our names on it!	4	12
You left us with this hypocrisy!	4	12
So deny it!	4	12
I did what I thought was best for the company.	4	12
You can either back me or not.	4	12
You did what was best for you, because you're impatient and childish.	4	12
You had a tantrum on a full page in The New York Times.	4	12
So no one is happy about this?	4	12
I don't know.	4	12
It's good enough to be the reason this place went down anymore.	4	12
-Excuse me. -Yes?	4	12
There's someone calling from Senator Kennedy's office.	4	12
Robert Kennedy wants to speak with you.	4	12
Please hold for the Senator.	4	12
Ls this here Don Draper?	4	12
-Yes. -This is Bobby Kennedy.	4	12
How are you this lovely morning?	4	12
I'm well. Thank you, Senator.	4	12
Bobby, please.	4	12
Listen, I just wanted to say that I admire	4	12
your fortitude and vigor and standing up to what I consider to be	4	12
one of the great menaces to this civilization as we know it.	4	12
That's very flattering-	4	12
I have one question:	4	12
Does your company represent Secor Laxatives?	4	12
Yes. Yes, we do.	4	12
Well, are you gonna be writing anything against them?	4	12
Because I want to make it clear that I am firmly anti-laxative-	4	12
Who the hell is this?	4	12
Teddy Chaough.	4	12
Thanks for sticking my name in there with the big boys.	4	12
A full-page ad in The Times. What did that run you?	4	12
A little mix-up there. That was Eunice Kennedy.	4	12
Keep joking. You're cynical and craven.	4	12
Tobacco put a roof over your head and it fed your children.	4	12
And then it killed my business.	4	12
I never thought you had the stomach for a partnership.	4	12
I'm no longer a part of this agency.	4	12
You there, get my shoes.	4	12
Bert, calm down.	4	12
I will not. We've created a monster.	4	12
I've already informed the other partners.	4	12
I'll need your contribution by close of business, as it were.	4	12
You know this could work.	4	12
Do you realize I've just moved my family back here?	4	12
I'm terribly sorry about that.	4	12
Did you get Dr. Miller?	4	12
Yes, but you were on with... You were on the phone.	4	12
She said she'd stop by later.	4	12
Okay, that'll be all.	4	12
By the way, I loved the letter.	4	12
I love that you stand for something.	4	12
Megan, that's not really what it's about.	4	12
"I know that part. I know it was about ""he didn't dump me, I dumped him."""	4	12
I just love that you did it.	4	12
It feels different around here.	4	12
Thank you.	4	12
-So who else called? -Everyone who's anyone.	4	12
"""Smokey the Bear, Smokey Robinson,"	4	12
"""Chiquita Banana, Aunt Jemima."""	4	12
Is he gonna quit smoking?	4	12
You're an idiot.	4	12
I heard from all my clients this morning, mostly out of morbid curiosity.	4	12
But one tning's for sure, tney're not talking about Lucky Strike anymore.	4	12
Well, I think that was the whole idea.	4	12
They're gonna fire everybody, or worse, make me fire everybody.	4	12
Well, it's been a pleasure working with you all.	4	12
I wish you the best of luck.	4	12
I didn't think they'd start with him.	4	12
Peggy, Mr. Draper wants to see you.	4	12
Okay.	4	12
It's a dog-eat-dog world.	4	12
-Should I close the door? -Yes.	4	12
Should I sit down?	4	12
Who can you live without?	4	12
Good. I mean, not good, but, you know...	4	12
Well, Danny, obviously, though he's Kind of grown on me.	4	12
Lane sent over a memo with suggestions.	4	12
"""All of the tobacco people, Mark Coyle, Wuzna..."""	4	12
"The Polish kid, ""Danny and Bill."""	4	12
That's a lot of people.	4	12
Are we going under?	4	12
No. Of course not.	4	12
I just wanted to give you notice so when they all come to you,	4	12
you'll know what's going on.	4	12
Okay.	4	12
So?	4	12
You haven't said anything about the letter.	4	12
I thought you didn't go in for those kinds of shenanigans.	4	12
Sally Draper.	4	12
Stop, both of you.	4	12
What are you doing here?	4	12
You stay away from her! You hear me?	4	12
Let's go.	4	12
We're not going back for your bike.	4	12
I told you, he's my friend. We don't do anything.	4	12
That boy is bad.	4	12
No, he's not.	4	12
Believe me. I know him better than you do.	4	12
You don't know him at all.	4	12
Go to your room.	4	12
You stopped by.	4	12
Yes. I'm glad to see you smiling.	4	12
Well, they all want to kill me, but I have a bodyguard.	4	12
-Can I get you anything? -No, thank you.	4	12
What's this?	4	12
My things.	4	12
We had to resign.	4	12
Geoff Atherton wants another cigarette account someday.	4	12
I'm so sorry. I didn't think about that.	4	12
I know.	4	12
I'm really sorry.	4	12
So,	4	12
you're gonna make it through this day, then you're going to leave this office,	4	12
meet me for dinner in the open, wherever I want,	4	12
and we're gonna talk about anything but work,	4	12
because we can do that now.	4	12
It's a fair trade.	4	12
La Caravelle, 8:00?	4	12
Sure.	4	12
Have your girl make reservations.	4	12
Just wanted to say goodbye.	4	12
No. What happened?	4	12
Tobacco is very touchy.	4	12
Who's gonna do our research?	4	12
You know, I just lost one of my best jobs-	4	12
No, I mean, I love working with you.	4	12
Would you have a drink with me?	4	12
-I don't want to linger. -Not right now. Just...	4	12
I hate to think I'm not gonna see you.	4	12
That's sweet.	4	12
No, I mean it.	4	12
You do your job so well,	4	12
and they respect you, and you don't have to play any games.	4	12
I didn't know that was possible.	4	12
Is that what it looks like?	4	12
I'm sure we'll work together again, somewhere.	4	12
Hello there.	4	12
So I'm home early for a family dinner.	4	12
They couldn't wait. We can eat later.	4	12
I'll eat with this crowd.	4	12
Well, I had quite a day.	4	12
That doesn't sound good.	4	12
It's this neighborhood. It's being taken over by low-caliber people.	4	12
I think it's time for us to move.	4	12
Great. You know how I feel about it.	4	12
I like that place in Rye.	4	12
Rye? Isn't that where Playland is?	4	12
She'll get over it.	4	12
Roger, Don, Harry and myself	4	12
should probably begin the process of letting people go	4	12
to avoid any further damage to morale.	4	12
And please try and limit any sympathetic adjustments to severance.	4	12
Yes, and as Lane mentioned, we'll try to hold onto any Staplers, scissors,	4	12
hole punches and tape dispensers.	4	12
They do disappear.	4	12
Don, are you ever gonna call back the American Cancer Society?	4	12
They've tried you twice this morning.	4	12
I saw that. it's a joke.	4	12
It's not. They finally called me.	4	12
They want us to come in and meet about an anti-smoking campaign.	4	12
Really?	4	12
Took me about five minutes to stop laughing. I hope I didn't blow it.	4	12
Well, that's interesting, right?	4	12
Great. Public service. Free work.	4	12
That's just what we should be doing right now.	4	12
It's prestigious.	4	12
But we can't eat prestige.	4	12
Someone called us. We could have new work on the air.	4	12
There's a lot of bigwigs on the board.	4	12
Under normal circumstances, I would consider this an opportunity.	4	12
Absolutely.	4	12
Yes, Don saved the company. Now go get rid of half of it.	4	12
We should probably stay in here.	4	12
I suppose.	4	12
Lane, may I speak with you a moment?	4	12
Well, I've gotta go learn a bunch of people's names before I fire them.	4	12
I know you said the end of business today, but that money, I don't have it.	4	12
Is there any way I can owe it on advance against bonus or future salary?	4	12
Calm yourself. Don paid your share.	4	12
What?	4	12
Perhaps you weren't supposed to know that.	4	12
Well, thank you for the opportunity.	4	12
It was my pleasure.	4	12
Bill.	4	12
Hello?	4	13
I still have to pack for a 7:00 a.m. flight, thanks to you.	4	13
Will you at least put me out of my misery before you go?	4	13
Stop it. American Cancer loved the letter, and they're gonna love you.	4	13
And then you're gonna stop working, take your Kids to California and have a ball.	4	13
I have this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.	4	13
Listen, maybe it's not all about work.	4	13
Maybe that sick feeling might go away	4	13
if you take your head out of the sand about the past.	4	13
You know it's not that simple.	4	13
Of course it isn't, and you don't have to do it alone.	4	13
 But if you resolve some of that,	4	13
you might be more comfortable with everything.	4	13
And then what happens?	4	13
And then you're stuck trying to be a person like the rest of us.	4	13
I'll call you Tuesday when you get back.	4	13
I'm gonna miss you, you know.	4	13
-Any outgoing? -Mail?	4	13
Just this.	4	13
Don't post it. it's for you.	4	13
It's been discussed among the partners that you be promoted	4	13
to director of agency operations.	4	13
-My goodness. -Now, it's a dreadful reality	4	13
that we've not signed any new business in 10 weeks,	4	13
so I hope you'll understand that this is a title only, for now.	4	13
 Well, it's almost an honor.	4	13
What made you suddenly write that?	4	13
Well, most of it was in the letter, hopefully,	4	13
but I think, in my heart, it was an impulse,	4	13
because I knew what I needed to do to move forward.	4	13
Well, it was a gesture we hope will be useful.	4	13
We believe, obviously, that lung cancer is avoidable	4	13
and can be thwarted with the right campaign.	4	13
But how?	4	13
We know frightening medical facts are useless.	4	13
-Half of us are smokers. -I'm a smoker, too.	4	13
And you can forget about us. I've worked $10 million campaigns	4	13
that can't even get people to change brands.	4	13
I can tell you from the inside that the business	4	13
is really only about getting new smokers.	4	13
-Teenagers are a tough sell. -Not to tobacco companies.	4	13
They play on a two-pronged attack, promising adulthood and rebellion,	4	13
but teenagers are sentimental, as well.	4	13
Have you heard their music?	4	13
-I can tell you a little of what I have in mind. -I have to say, it's very interesting.	4	13
Go on.	4	13
What I'm suggesting is a series of commercials	4	13
that run during Bandstand and the like.	4	13
Show mothers and daughters or fathers and sons,	4	13
and that cigarettes are between them.	4	13
And you show with a walk on the beach, baking cookies, playing catch,	4	13
that the parents are not long for this world.	4	13
But they hate their parents.	4	13
They won't be thinking about their parents. They'll be thinking about themselves.	4	13
That's what they do.	4	13
The truth is,	4	13
they're mourning for their childhood more than they're anticipating their future,	4	13
because they don't know it yet, but they don't want to die.	4	13
If it helps, I can guarantee you that Lucky Strike will hate this.	4	13
-How'd it go? -So, did you get Cancer?	4	13
Megan, can you get Mr. Cosgrove?	4	13
-We've got a meeting for another meeting. -They were eating out of his hand.	4	13
And even better, the board was loaded with fat cats, just like you said.	4	13
Don had a particularly empathic exchange with the CEO of Dow Chemical.	4	13
Saran Wrap would be nice.	4	13
I'll take him out on the links, let him beat me.	4	13
Roger, this is a philanthropic organization.	4	13
Don and I think it best if we approach from the rear.	4	13
-Are we celebrating? -Don got us to the top three.	4	13
-Stupendous. -Ken, sit down.	4	13
Everett Marlowe at Dow is a very charming fellow.	4	13
Your father-in-law to be is at Corning, right? They must be quite acquainted.	4	13
-I think that's likely. -Well, I was thinking,	4	13
wouldn't it be fun to have a foursome this weekend	4	13
that includes your father-in-law, yourself and Mr. Marlowe?	4	13
Doesn't that sound like fun?	4	13
-I don't know. -Ken, there's no reason to be suddenly shy.	4	13
I'm sure if you impressed Everett this morning,	4	13
that should be enough to get him on the phone.	4	13
Well, I just looked him in the eye and convinced him	4	13
I was some kind of idealistic businessman. How is it gonna look if I call for a meeting?	4	13
Pretty bad, I guess.	4	13
But I'm not Pete.	4	13
-Sorry about that. -No, you're obviously not.	4	13
Tom Vogel is our biggest client, unless we sign Dow, which would be yours.	4	13
Look, I love Cynthia's dad,	4	13
and I know that every account I have will eventually leave me.	4	13
-That's awfully pessimistic. -Well, it's not worth the risk.	4	13
Cynthia's my life. My actual life.	4	13
Fine, if you want to tuck it between your legs, I'll call him,	4	13
but I have to warn you, I'm going to drop your name.	4	13
You do whatever you want.	4	13
Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to go service the 30% of this firm	4	13
that are my clients.	4	13
Hello, Carla. Is Sally home?	4	13
-She is, but you shouldn't be here. -Are they moving today?	4	13
Monday. That's the Salvation Army.	4	13
Mrs. Draper's car is gone. I just wanted to say hi.	4	13
-I don't know. -Fine. I just want to say bye.	4	13
She's upstairs. Don't be long. Mrs. Francis just ran to the store.	4	13
Thank you.	4	13
-It's Glen. Are you decent? -Come in.	4	13
You really shouldn't be here.	4	13
So, you're finally moving.	4	13
This weekend while we're in California with my dad.	4	13
-Jeez, is that where you're moving? -No, we're moving to Rye.	4	13
I'll be able to drive in a few years.	4	13
-I can come visit. -Really?	4	13
Absolutely.	4	13
I can send you postcards. I have your address.	4	13
It's not that big a deal. I say goodbye to people all the time.	4	13
Okay. Are you going to Disneyland?	4	13
-Yes. -Get me something.	4	13
-What are you doing here? -I'm sorry. it's my fault.	4	13
Get out.	4	13
-What are you waiting for? -Why do you hate me?	4	13
You don't think I know what you're doing? You could be friends with anyone.	4	13
Just 'cause you're sad doesn't mean everybody has to be.	4	13
I'm sorry. I didn't see the harm. He wanted to say goodbye.	4	13
-Did you leave them alone? -They're friends, that's all.	4	13
When did you decide that you're her mother?	4	13
It was a mistake. There's no need for that kind of talk.	4	13
You know what, Carla?	4	13
I've been thinking, and the distance is...	4	13
I need someone new nearby, someone closer to the new house.	4	13
This should square us for the week.	4	13
Do you think I enjoy doing this? After all these years? I won't have it, Carla.	4	13
Well, someone has to look after those children.	4	13
Really? And where are your kids?	4	13
-Are they all doctors and lawyers? -You'd best stop talking now.	4	13
-Where are you going? -I'm going to say goodbye to the children.	4	13
Do you think that's a good idea right now? It'll just upset them more.	4	13
Some other time.	4	13
The bungalow in San Pedro netted you 10 grand in profit.	4	13
What's happening with the other house?	4	13
I have a listing appointment with the realtor when I get back from California,	4	13
-but I have no idea what it's worth. -it's Ossining,	4	13
but I say you'll more than double your money,	4	13
which is not bad for 10 years.	4	13
What about the loss for what I put into the company?	4	13
That's an investment. it's not a loss. Don't be impatient.	4	13
Enjoy the harvest. Plant some seeds. Maybe get a place of your own.	4	13
Don't you want to go home someday and see a steak on the table?	4	13
So, Mary Sunshine, what's the capital gains? 48%?	4	13
-Mrs. Francis is on the phone. It's urgent. -You want me to go?	4	13
It's always urgent.	4	13
-Hello? -I'm very sorry,	4	13
and I know this will disrupt your plans, but I'm afraid I had to let Carla go today.	4	13
-What? What happened? -Don, I have the children 99% of the time.	4	13
This is a decision that I get to make.	4	13
-Well, can't I just hire her back for the trip? -No! I don't want her poisoning the well.	4	13
I told the kids she's sick.	4	13
So what the hell do I do, Betty, with no help?	4	13
I have meetings, two flights, diapers, for Christ's sake.	4	13
-Then don't take them! They're used to it. -We're going!	4	13
Hey, Pumpernickel. There's nobody out front.	4	13
-I already ate. -Me too,	4	13
and I ran into someone I'd like you to meet. This is Carolyn Jones, like Morticia.	4	13
Peggy Olson, advertising wunderkind	4	13
-Pleased to meet you. -Do you mind?	4	13
Carolyn was at a photo shoot modeling pantyhose, of all things,	4	13
and she got fired and she has to make rent.	4	13
Joyce witnessed my nervous breakdown at Howard Johnson's today.	4	13
Well, hello, ladies.	4	13
Peggy, I needed to talk to you about my ABC meeting,	4	13
but if I'm interrupting... Who is this lovely young thing?	4	13
Harry, this is my friend Joyce. I thought you'd already met.	4	13
Harold Crane, head of media.	4	13
-Carolyn Jones. -No kidding.	4	13
-She's looking for work. -That's hard to believe.	4	13
As an actress, model? What is your experience like?	4	13
Well, I've been modeling, at least until this morning.	4	13
The Topaz people went nuts, fired the people who hired me,	4	13
-and then me. -But you didn't do anything wrong, did you?	4	13
No, she didn't. Peggy, do you think you can help?	4	13
Maybe. I'm sorry. You said Topaz fired everyone?	4	13
-They were very brusque. -People lose their heads.	4	13
I'm sure it was a mistake, dear.	4	13
-We should be going, honey. -Yes. Yes, of course.	4	13
Pleased to meet you.	4	13
We'll see what we can do, Carolyn Jones.	4	13
-Any luck? -The hotel has a service,	4	13
but the girls who can take care of Sally and Bobby	4	13
won't watch a two-year-old and vice versa,	4	13
so I've arranged for two girls to cover the two mornings you're working.	4	13
I thought you might need someone for Disneyland,	4	13
and maybe handle the Dodger game on your own.	4	13
-Does that sound like a vacation? -Maybe it'll be an adventure.	4	13
How much do you make a week?	4	13
-$70. -What if I were to double that?	4	13
I'll give you some nights free, and you'll get to go to California.	4	13
Swimming pools, movie stars.	4	13
I don't really have any professional experience.	4	13
You'll be great. Sally loved you, and Bobby likes a pretty face,	4	13
and the baby... He's tough, but he's fun.	4	13
I've never been to California.	4	13
I have a college friend who's been begging me to visit.	4	13
Perfect. Call her up, pick a night, I'll foot the bill. What do you have to lose?	4	13
Please, stop the advertising.	4	13
Come on. Let's go to the room first.	4	13
Let's go, or we're gonna go back to the parking lot	4	13
and spend the weekend locked in the car.	4	13
Art Garten, real name. At Topaz Pantyhose? Called me back.	4	13
He was shocked and impressed that I'd heard about them firing Dupre.	4	13
It gets better. They already bought placement	4	13
for the campaign that just fell apart,	4	13
and we've been invited in Monday to pick up the pieces.	4	13
-I just told you that. -Monday's a holiday.	4	13
They're out of time. All we have to do is not throw up on our shoes.	4	13
-Do you want help? -She's not gonna be there.	4	13
Good work.	4	13
Okay, okay, here he is.	4	13
-That was great. -it's how we got Gene to sleep.	4	13
Well, let's not wake him up.	4	13
They played in the pool for four hours and bounced on the bed for another two.	4	13
I think everybody's gonna sleep very well.	4	13
I need you to come over at 7:00 tomorrow to watch Gene.	4	13
I'll get these two breakfast on the road.	4	13
Okay.	4	13
-Good night. -Good night.	4	13
You said you didn't have any experience, and you're like Maria von Trapp.	4	13
Professionally, but I have four nieces and six nephews.	4	13
-So, how was your meeting? -Pick me up and move me to my bed.	4	13
Well, hello, there.	4	13
Stephanie, this is Sally and Bobby.	4	13
-Hello. -Hi.	4	13
Well, it's very nice to meet you. How do you like California?	4	13
They love it.	4	13
The notary was supposed to be here at 10:00, but she's late.	4	13
My mom put the papers in order, so all you have to do is sign,	4	13
and then you can go to Marineland.	4	13
Who painted on the wall?	4	13
My friend Anna. She used to live here. Stephanie is her niece.	4	13
Who's Dick?	4	13
That's me.	4	13
That's my nickname sometimes.	4	13
Go out back and get us some lemons.	4	13
They're adorable.	4	13
Is this it?	4	13
My friend Charlie is gonna help me move the piano back to my mom's,	4	13
and the rest of it goes to St. Vincent de Paul.	4	13
Four boxes. Good for her.	4	13
She wanted you to have something.	4	13
It's her engagement ring from Don.	4	13
-Don't you want it? -She wanted you to have it.	4	13
You shouldn't play around with that. Besides, I don't believe in it.	4	13
-So, are you going back to school? -Not for the moment.	4	13
-What are you gonna do? -I don't know.	4	13
That's the best part, right? Got the rest of my life ahead of me.	4	13
So do you.	4	13
That's her.	4	13
Who's that?	4	13
-How was it? -Most of it was fun.	4	13
-Daddy, are you coming in? -I'm not wearing my bathing suit.	4	13
Come in. You have to come in.	4	13
-I'm gonna be a shark. -Come on, Daddy.	4	13
You swim all the time in New York.	4	13
I'm really beat.	4	13
Should I throw some herring to you two?	4	13
Dumbo, Mad Tea Party.	4	13
-And Mr. Toad. -Gene can't go on Mr. Toad.	4	13
I'll get it.	4	13
He can stay with Megan while we go on the ride.	4	13
Then Megan can't go.	4	13
Hi, Sally.	4	13
This is my friend Camille.	4	13
Camille, this is Don and Gene and Bobby and Sally.	4	13
Hello, everybody.	4	13
I just wanted to make sure you didn't need anything else.	4	13
No, I think we're okay.	4	13
-Where are you going? -The Whisky a Go Go.	4	13
-Good night, everybody. -Good night. Have fun.	4	13
What about Tomorrowland? I don't want to ride an elephant.	4	13
I want to fly a jet.	4	13
Hello?	4	13
-Henry? -I'm in here.	4	13
I'm sorry. Everyone was late	4	13
and then it took three of them to light the pilot on the water heater.	4	13
Carla called looking for you.	4	13
-What did she want? -You know what she wanted.	4	13
You fired her and didn't tell me?	4	13
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't want her invoking your sympathies.	4	13
-Why did you fire her? -Because I don't trust her judgment-	4	13
What did she say?	4	13
She said you wouldn't give her a letter of recommendation.	4	13
How long did the woman work for you? I know she doesn't steal. What did she do?	4	13
And don't tell me it's just about the neighbor boy.	4	13
Sally is not allowed to see him.	4	13
"-Carla said he's her friend. -""Carla said."" ""Carla said""?"	4	13
I don't understand what you're doing.	4	13
You didn't want to move because you wanted the kids to have some stability,	4	13
and then you get rid of their nanny since they were born?	4	13
I wanted a fresh start, okay?	4	13
-I'm entitled to that. -There is no fresh start! Lives carry on!	4	13
Jesus, Henry, just once could you take my side?	4	13
No one's ever on your side, Betty.	4	13
Just a minute.	4	13
Am I bothering you?	4	13
No, I was out on the balcony enjoying the view.	4	13
I heard you come in and I wanted to go over the plan for tomorrow for Disneyland.	4	13
Do you think I should be involved in such high-level decisions?	4	13
I can't turn on the TV. They're asleep.	4	13
There's nothing on TV. Come outside with me.	4	13
It's so beautiful here.	4	13
-Did you have fun with your friend? -Not really. She's not really my friend.	4	13
We just lived together during college. My father's a professor.	4	13
I think she liked him too much.	4	13
So, why did you see her?	4	13
I don't know.	4	13
She's an actress now. She's in two episodes of Hogan's Heroes.	4	13
She told me I could never do it because of my teeth.	4	13
She actually said that to me.	4	13
I don't even want to be an actress.	4	13
I love your teeth.	4	13
I took elocution lessons when I moved to New York.	4	13
The teacher said I had the mouth of a singer.	4	13
-Are you sure we should do this? -I've been thinking about you so much.	4	13
Were you thinking about this when I asked you to come?	4	13
It was the first thought that went through my head.	4	13
I was gonna miss you so much, anyway.	4	13
-You don't know anything about me. -But I do.	4	13
I know that you have a good heart,	4	13
and I know that you're always trying to be better.	4	13
We all try. We don't always make it.	4	13
I've done a lot of things.	4	13
I know who you are now.	4	13
-It's getting light outside. -I should get back before the sun comes up.	4	13
They're little roosters.	4	13
You should go. I don't want to confuse them.	4	13
I want to know if I can knock on this door again tomorrow night,	4	13
or if this is just what it is, like that night in the office.	4	13
-I need to know. I don't know why. -Because you're afraid?	4	13
You shouldn't be.	4	13
Disneyland fireworks are at 9:00.	4	13
How about dinner tomorrow night at 11:00 right here?	4	13
We're gonna be together all day.	4	13
This is Art. Art, Ken Cosgrove and Patricia...	4	13
-What was it? -Peggy Olson.	4	13
Sit. I'd offer you coffee, but everybody's gone for the holiday.	4	13
The perils of being in charge.	4	13
So, you can tell we don't have a lot of time.	4	13
I mean, not just today. We're in kind of a bind.	4	13
We're no worse than we were before,	4	13
-and I hated those people. -Do you have the old work?	4	13
Somewhere. Look, it was a gorgeous girl.	4	13
High heels, jewelry, pulling up this Cinderella gown to show the Topaz,	4	13
but she wasn't Cinderella, and where the hell was she going?	4	13
We want something that'll stand out. I don't care if it's a cartoon.	4	13
I don't care if it's Abe Beame wearing them.	4	13
We're a tiny company. We need to make a stink.	4	13
Well, I've worn them,	4	13
but what qualities, in your mind, do they have that make them unique?	4	13
You're wearing them right now?	4	13
Yes. Because I can wear Topaz Pantyhose with anything.	4	13
I'm wearing them at work right now,	4	13
and I'll change everything but my hose before I go out tonight.	4	13
One pair. That's all you need with Topaz.	4	13
If we only sold each girl one pair, we'd be out of business.	4	13
"""Topaz. The only pair of pantyhose you'll ever need."	4	13
"“Bad for business. Good for you."""	4	13
That's very funny,	4	13
'cause it says our product's so good, we're not even interested in ourselves.	4	13
-Okay, that's one. What else you got? -Well, I'd have to think more,	4	13
but it might be great to show a bunch of different outfits.	4	13
One for formal, one for business, one a little sporty,	4	13
"and something like ""Single pair, singular comfort."""	4	13
"-it's got the word ""single"" in it. -That's two."	4	13
Daddy, tell Sally that snakes used to have legs.	4	13
-I don't know if that's true. -You know, it's true in the Bible.	4	13
We learned that they used to be fish,	4	13
and he doesn't know because he has baby science.	4	13
They found a skeleton.	4	13
Where? You don't know. You're a short stuff.	4	13
Okay, Thally.	4	13
-Shut up! -Great!	4	13
Don't be upset. it's just a milkshake.	4	13
Can you grab a straw or some napkins? This is my last dress.	4	13
I'm sorry. Is it late?	4	13
I wanted to let you sleep.	4	13
-How long have you been up? -A few hours.	4	13
What's wrong?	4	13
I couldn't sleep.	4	13
I just kept thinking about you.	4	13
I'm right here.	4	13
I don't know what it is about you,	4	13
but I feel like myself when I'm with you,	4	13
but the way I always wanted to feel.	4	13
Because I'm in love with you, Megan, and I think I have been for a while.	4	13
Don.	4	13
Oh, my goodness.	4	13
Open it.	4	13
It's beautiful.	4	13
When I saw you sleeping there, I thought...	4	13
I couldn't imagine not seeing you there every morning.	4	13
Will you marry me?	4	13
I don't know what to say. This is all so fast.	4	13
Did you ever think of the number of things that had to happen	4	13
for me to get to know you?	4	13
But everything happened,	4	13
and it got me here. What does that mean?	4	13
I can't believe this.	4	13
Yes ! Yes !	4	13
You have a ring? How long have you been thinking about this?	4	13
It's been in my family...	4	13
Not my family, really.	4	13
It belonged to someone very important to me.	4	13
I don't believe this. I have to call my mother.	4	13
I had this feeling, and I called her from California	4	13
-because I wanted it to go away. -I saw it on the bill.	4	13
Sorry. I have to call her. Do you want me to call her from work?	4	13
No, call her.	4	13
-What about work? What do we do? -We tell everybody.	4	13
Okay.	4	13
Do you want me to leave you alone?	4	13
-Do you want me to talk to her? -Do you speak French?	4	13
-What the hell's going on? -I don't know. He wouldn't say.	4	13
Look at you, brown as a berry.	4	13
-How was the coast? -Wonderful. Joan, could you shut the door?	4	13
I have an announcement to make,	4	13
and it shouldn't change anything here, except for me, and maybe for Joan,	4	13
but Miss Calvet and I are getting married.	4	13
-Who the hell's that? -Megan.	4	13
Really?	4	13
Congratulations, Don. I wish you the best of luck.	4	13
Megan out there?	4	13
Yeah, I know it's a surprise, but she makes me very happy,	4	13
and, well, it's something we both want very much.	4	13
Well, let's get her in here.	4	13
Megan.	4	13
-How exciting for you. -I know. I can't believe it.	4	13
Congratulations, dear.	4	13
"You don't say ""congratulations"" to the bride. You say ""best wishes."""	4	13
Congratulations, Don.	4	13
Let's have a toast. Megan, could you get us some ice?	4	13
I'm teasing. See, Don? This is the way to behave.	4	13
-So, when are you getting married? -I don't know. We haven't discussed it.	4	13
Soon.	4	13
-Art Garten just called. -No. What did he say?	4	13
He said he liked ideas two and four, and we've got a week.	4	13
-Shall we go rub it in? -After you.	4	13
You did it.	4	13
-We've got some great news. -Are you two getting married?	4	13
-What's going on? -They're getting married.	4	13
-Really? -Congratulations!	4	13
-Thank you. -it's incredible.	4	13
-I know. It just happened. -That's incredible. You must be so happy.	4	13
I'll get it.	4	13
-We have some news, too. Peg. -Yes! We signed an account.	4	13
Topaz Pantyhose. It's a quarter of a million dollars.	4	13
-How'd you do that? -Peggy found out about them,	4	13
and then we met over the holiday.	4	13
That's great news! We broke the streak! What a great day! Good work, both of you!	4	13
So anyway, I guess we should tell everybody.	4	13
-Topaz needs work this week. -Great.	4	13
I hope you have all the happiness that Peggy and I had signing this account.	4	13
I'll be there in a minute.	4	13
Wow.	4	13
It's been going on a while, but I appreciate your concern.	4	13
Well, then I'm happy for you. Both of you.	4	13
She's very beautiful.	4	13
You know, she reminds me of you. She's got the same spark.	4	13
I know she admires you just as much as I do.	4	13
It was Dr. Miller again.	4	13
It's not gonna get any easier the longer you wait.	4	13
Whatever could be on your mind?	4	13
-Can you believe it? -It happens all the time.	4	13
They're all just between marriages. You know that.	4	13
He'll probably make her a copywriter.	4	13
He's not going to want to be married to his secretary.	4	13
Really? Is that what he meant?	4	13
"""She admires you""? Jesus."	4	13
That's the way it works for some.	4	13
You know, I just saved this company.	4	13
I signed the first new business since Lucky Strike left,	4	13
but it's not as important as getting married. Again.	4	13
Well, I was just made director of agency operations.	4	13
A title. No money, of course.	4	13
And if they poured champagne, it must've been while I was pushing the mail cart.	4	13
A pretty face comes along, and everything goes out the window.	4	13
Well, I learned a long time ago to not get all my satisfaction from this job.	4	13
That's bullshit.	4	13
-Faye Miller. -Hi, it's me.	4	13
I was starting to worry you were ill or something.	4	13
-I need to talk to you. -Well, I was gonna come by at lunch anyway.	4	13
No, you shouldn't do that. Why don't we meet somewhere?	4	13
What is going on?	4	13
Something happened, and I'd like to talk to you about it face to face.	4	13
-Meet me for coffee. -Okay.	4	13
You know what?	4	13
I'm not gonna have some conversation and have to sit through coffee afterwards.	4	13
Just get to it.	4	13
Well,	4	13
H	4	13
met somebody.	4	13
-And we're engaged. -Are you kidding me?	4	13
I know, I know. it's a surprise. It was for me too.	4	13
Jesus.	4	13
Who is she?	4	13
What's the difference? I fell in love.	4	13
I didn't mean for this to happen. You've been very important to me.	4	13
So you're not gonna put an ad in the New York Times	4	13
saying you never liked me?	4	13
-Faye. -Well, I hope you're very happy,	4	13
and I hope she knows you only like the beginnings of things.	4	13
I'm sorry.	4	13
-I don't know what else to say. -Goodbye.	4	13
I saw the light go off.	4	13
It's fine. It's done.	4	13
I love you, you know.	4	13
And he's smiling like a fool,	4	13
like he's the first man that ever married his secretary.	4	13
She's 25. As if that's news.	4	13
So, when are you gonna tell them your news?	4	13
They'll know soon enough.	4	13
Are you showing at all? The picture I have of you doesn't change.	4	13
-I'll take a new one and I'll send it to you. -You know all I want to know.	4	13
Yes, honey, they're bigger.	4	13
Why are you torturing me? I just woke up and it's already 90 degrees here.	4	13
Listen, I've gotta go.	4	13
-Not yet. -What?	4	13
-Not yet! -You listen to the doctor.	4	13
You have to eat. Don't worry about your figure.	4	13
I'll whip you and the baby into shape when I get back.	4	13
Okay.	4	13
I'll call you Thursday night, your time.	4	13
-Okay. I love you. -I love you, too.	4	13
Hello?	4	13
-Mrs. Truxton? -No, it's me.	4	13
-What are you doing here? -it's Tuesday at 7:00.	4	13
I thought I told you I had a listing appointment	4	13
with the real estate agent.	4	13
I didn't realize that was today. I forgot about the cabinets in the guest bath.	4	13
-So you weren't that thorough? -I guess not.	4	13
-Do you like the new house? -I do. it's got a lot of character.	4	13
I'll probably have to tear out the kitchen.	4	13
Remember this place?	4	13
I do.	4	13
-it's different. That's for certain. -isn't that what you wanted?	4	13
I don't know, Don.	4	13
Things aren't perfect.	4	13
So you'll move again.	4	13
So much change. it's made everything	4	13
difficult.	4	13
I have to tell you something.	4	13
I met someone.	4	13
I'm engaged.	4	13
Really?	4	13
-Bethany Van Nuys? -No. Someone at work.	4	13
I'm very happy for you.	4	13
It's okay, Betty.	4	13
I don't know why I'm surprised.	4	13
Is she your secretary? I know she watched the kids in California.	4	13
Yes.	4	13
So, I will see you the weekend after next.	4	13
-What is that, the 23rd? -I think so.	4	13
Wait.	4	13
Congratulations.	4	13
Thank you.	4	13
O-wee-o, o-wee-o.	5	1
We got the poverty. Where is the dough?	5	1
O-wee-o, o-wee-o.	5	1
We got the poverty. Where is the dough?	5	1
Shut up!	5	1
Get a job!	5	1
Somebody call the cops?	5	1
That's all there is, cops, and negroes, and priests.	5	1
You're walking in a circle.	5	1
It must be hot out there.	5	1
What are you doing?	5	1
 You hit one.	5	1
Hey, watch the work.	5	1
To the men's room.	5	1
Less promises, more money!	5	1
Do you know somebody's throwing water bombs out your windows?	5	1
What are you talking about?	5	1
Everybody saw it was coming from this floor.	5	1
We all saw it.	5	1
This is the executive floor. That's utterly ridiculous.	5	1
Don't you call us ridiculous.	5	1
Is this what Madison Avenue represents?	5	1
And they call us savages.	5	1
What are you doing up?	5	1
I thought this was the bathroom.	5	1
 It's down there.	5	1
Okay.	5	1
You want breakfast?	5	1
Happy birthday.	5	1
Oh, thank you.	5	1
We should wait for his cake.	5	1
We're not gonna be here on his actual birthday.	5	1
Thank you.	5	1
It's from all of us.	5	1
We'll go to the deli for dinner tonight and have cherry cheesecake.	5	1
Open it now.	5	1
Yes, ma'am.	5	1
- Can I turn the bacon? - No.	5	1
I love it.	5	1
- Good morning, everybody. - Morning.	5	1
- Hi, Megan. - Hi.	5	1
That's so nice.	5	1
He needs one of those.	5	1
It's a badger, from its tail.	5	1
- What are we doing today? - We're going to the Statue of Liberty.	5	1
You always say that, but we never do.	5	1
You hungry?	5	1
Just black coffee for me.	5	1
Okay, everybody.	5	1
Have a happy birthday.	5	1
Thank you, Sals.	5	1
How old are you gonna be?	5	1
Forty.	5	1
So, when you're 40, how old will I be?	5	1
You'll be dead.	5	1
We're not gonna see you next weekend,	5	1
but we'll see you the weekend after.	5	1
- That's the 11th. - If you say so.	5	1
You'll be 70.	5	1
That's right.	5	1
You're not gonna come in?	5	1
No, but give Morticia and Lurch my love.	5	1
Flick the porch light when you get there, all right?	5	1
- AII right. - Good night, animals.	5	1
Say good night, honey.	5	1
Good night, Daddy.	5	1
Get your brother's hand.	5	1
Bye.	5	1
You're losing your head there.	5	1
Dandruff.	5	1
It's spit-up.	5	1
I saw your wife dropping you off.	5	1
Such a sweet scene.	5	1
Yes.	5	1
She has quite a smile.	5	1
She's getting back to herself.	5	1
How old is the kid?	5	1
I thought it would be a little faster.	5	1
Does she cry all the time?	5	1
No.	5	1
She just...	5	1
There was a time when she wouldn't leave the house in a robe.	5	1
Listen, there's a point	5	1
when you go from going home on the 5:25 to the 7:05.	5	1
If you finally learn how to drive, you can push it to 9:30.	5	1
You're getting the wrong impression.	5	1
Or not come home at all.	5	1
Beth and I got into it so bad the other night,	5	1
I just jumped in the car and drove.	5	1
Made it all the way to some motel in Rocky Hill.	5	1
Put my fist through a wall.	5	1
Howard, don't get emotional again.	5	1
Maybe she's right.	5	1
Maybe I am a little selfish.	5	1
I said I needed time with my thoughts.	5	1
She asked me what I do at work all day.	5	1
They don't understand.	5	1
Greenwich. Next stop, Greenwich, Port Chester, Rye...	5	1
Who am I kidding? It's nothing a little peace wouldn't fix.	5	1
There you go.	5	1
Morning.	5	1
Of course. I'll let him know.	5	1
- Was that for me? - No.	5	1
- Who was it? - Really?	5	1
Fine. What's Don up to today?	5	1
I see a lot of napping and pillow talk.	5	1
That's your schedule.	5	1
You all had the status meeting 20 minutes ago.	5	1
Can't you sit over there once in a while?	5	1
What if I have someone important coming in?	5	1
When you have somebody come in, I will sit over there.	5	1
Here, why don't you buy yourself	5	1
a fancy hat or a mask or something?	5	1
No, thank you.	5	1
AII I'm asking for is a few hours a day	5	1
where the world might mistake you for my secretary.	5	1
Joan said you were supposed to share.	5	1
And his phone rings more.	5	1
Joan's not here. And you just took $50 from me.	5	1
Let your conscience be your guide.	5	1
That feels good.	5	1
That feels so much better.	5	1
Yeah.	5	1
I was right. Somebody was very wet.	5	1
When you were that size, I used to change you every hour	5	1
whether you needed it or not.	5	1
I don't know how many times I have to say this.	5	1
Those go in the cabinet in the hallway.	5	1
I'm sorry.	5	1
I thought it'd be easier if they were near your bathroom.	5	1
I didn't mean it that way.	5	1
I haven't slept.	5	1
And I just feel cooped up in here.	5	1
I think it's bad for Kevin to be out there until I'm done cleaning the oven, the fumes.	5	1
I don't know why you had to do that on a hot summer day.	5	1
Anyway, I think we're about to run out of formula.	5	1
I'll get your purse.	5	1
Hello.	5	1
Hello, you. We're gonna take a nap. Would you like that?	5	1
You want to lay in the bed with Mommy?	5	1
A ten?	5	1
You buying his formula or yours?	5	1
I'll take him for a walk.	5	1
Oh, God, would you?	5	1
You're gonna go with Grandma Gail. That's where you're gonna go.	5	1
Close the door.	5	1
How was everybody's weekend?	5	1
Great. We all went waterskiing together.	5	1
- Made a human pyramid. - I was here.	5	1
Splendid. So, I trust you're adequately prepared for the Heinz presentation.	5	1
Yes, boss. We have almost everything.	5	1
Just short Mrs. Draper's work. She's writing the coupons.	5	1
Has Don signed off?	5	1
He's late, and so is she, coincidently.	5	1
Clara.	5	1
Clara!	5	1
"She should have just rolled over and said, ""Don, what do you think of this?"""	5	1
I bet she says that every morning.	5	1
Come on, it's 11:00.	5	1
- No sunbathing? - No.	5	1
Look, we had a three-day weekend and you didn't do anything?	5	1
That's not my calendar.	5	1
Clara.	5	1
How was your weekend?	5	1
- Clara, is Mr. Draper in yet? - No.	5	1
You're late for the status meeting.	5	1
You should probably go prepare instead of molesting my secretary.	5	1
Well, sweetheart, the torture's over. Let the fun begin.	5	1
My office is 30 yards away.	5	1
So when I hit that buzzer, I'm trying to save myself	5	1
a trip through the miracle of telephonics.	5	1
Mr. and Mrs. Draper are here.	5	1
- Good morning. - So sorry, we overslept.	5	1
That's not true. I did.	5	1
How was Memorial Day?	5	1
It was nice. We had my kids.	5	1
You had the status meeting at 10:00.	5	1
- Morning. - Good morning.	5	1
Did you read about Y&R's paper bag drop?	5	1
I did.	5	1
- I don't see the humor. - It's funny.	5	1
I mean, if nothing else, it serves them right for stealing Pond's.	5	1
And what does one thing have to do with the other?	5	1
They stole the Pond's account, and now they're a laughingstock.	5	1
Makes me feel better.	5	1
Gentlemen, shall we mosey on over to the conference room?	5	1
We did have a meeting at 10:00.	5	1
Morning, Lane, clipboard.	5	1
We should run a want ad saying something like,	5	1
"""Sterling Cooper, an equal opportunity employer."""	5	1
"""Our windows don't open."""	5	1
As tempting as it sounds,	5	1
I don't know if we need to be spending money	5	1
to further their embarrassment.	5	1
Look, if there's no line item for humiliating the competition,	5	1
Don will write it and I'll pay for it.	5	1
But you're not allowed to read it.	5	1
Forget the want ads. The advertising column.	5	1
I want them to see it.	5	1
So, Heinz is coming in. Don?	5	1
Yes. Caroline, can you get Megan and the Heinz boards, please?	5	1
- Do you want the team? - No.	5	1
- What else? - Status is status quo on my end.	5	1
I'm supposed to have drinks with Bruce Lewis from Oldsmobile.	5	1
He wants to know if there's a way around Nader.	5	1
There isn't. Anything else?	5	1
Lane?	5	1
I have a lunch at the 4As,	5	1
so I should be back in time, but not necessarily conscious.	5	1
And according to the memo, Kenny finally has signatures	5	1
from Chevalier, Galone, and Butler Shoes.	5	1
Footwear. AII good news.	5	1
I suppose that brings this meeting to a close.	5	1
Don, may I speak with you privately?	5	1
I should take a look at these right away.	5	1
Mr. Campbell.	5	1
I have a call of nature.	5	1
Do not begin this meeting without me.	5	1
When is he free next?	5	1
You obviously haven't seen my coupons yet.	5	1
- Let's get out of here. - No.	5	1
Then lock the door.	5	1
As soon as I'm in here longer than five minutes,	5	1
people will start to...	5	1
What? Who?	5	1
I have to get these to Peggy.	5	1
You have a presentation, you know.	5	1
I could make you go home right now, you know. I have that power.	5	1
Mr. Campbell is here to see you.	5	1
I just saw him.	5	1
I have to get back to work.	5	1
Open your blouse.	5	1
You're a dirty old man.	5	1
- Anything else? - No, ma'am.	5	1
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?	5	1
I asked for your first available meeting,	5	1
and it turns out you have nothing to do today.	5	1
If you could have any client in the world, who would you want?	5	1
- American Airlines. - Why?	5	1
- Because they stood us up. - Right.	5	1
So, I started thinking, who has those feelings about us?	5	1
Mohawk Airlines.	5	1
You were very close.	5	1
The company's in a lot of trouble.	5	1
It's very nice that things have not gone well since we cut them loose.	5	1
They want to come back?	5	1
After the way we treated them...	5	1
So, that American Airlines thing isn't happening?	5	1
- I, for one, am very excited. - Oh, me, too.	5	1
I just don't understand the secrecy or the urgency.	5	1
I'm meeting with them today, and I think you should drop by.	5	1
Hank Lammott hit me pretty hard on his way out the door.	5	1
I may not help.	5	1
Don, you're the big draw.	5	1
They're not going to ask for someone else.	5	1
Look, get through this, get them back for more,	5	1
and I'll make time in my busy schedule.	5	1
Got it. I'll let you know when I need you to...	5	1
It's a good idea.	5	1
Can I get some coffee?	5	1
Oh, Megan, you're here.	5	1
"I took a risk on one of them. ""Two for 22 cents."""	5	1
Nice.	5	1
Of course, we're really locked into the five-cents off, but good thinking.	5	1
Stan, can you do something to these?	5	1
Like what?	5	1
I don't know.	5	1
Do that thing with the border around the edge,	5	1
so it kind of looks like legal tender,	5	1
with the can of beans where Washington goes.	5	1
You want me to put a little wig on him?	5	1
Play with it.	5	1
Drop dead.	5	1
Keep asking me to be more and more specific	5	1
until you're drawing it yourself.	5	1
- Do you want me to move? - Oh, no, no.	5	1
- I'm just looking for gum. - Oh, I have some.	5	1
So, I have to ask your opinion about something.	5	1
You did a great job,	5	1
but I can't really go overboard on coupons.	5	1
I did that kind of baloney for two years.	5	1
You should take comfort in the fact that it's very important to the client.	5	1
Too important.	5	1
No, it's something else.	5	1
Tomorrow's Don's birthday.	5	1
Oh, shit. It's June 1 st?	5	1
I forgot.	5	1
Got to get him something.	5	1
I still haven't gotten you a wedding present.	5	1
Sorry. You know how busy I've been.	5	1
No, it's just...	5	1
I'm throwing a party for him on Saturday.	5	1
It's a surprise.	5	1
Oh, okay.	5	1
For Don?	5	1
Yes.	5	1
Men hate surprises.	5	1
Didn't you have Lucy in Canada?	5	1
Look, nobody likes it in theory, but people are always glad.	5	1
And you've never seen me throw a party.	5	1
Everyone's going to go home from this and they're gonna have sex.	5	1
Okay.	5	1
Sounds like fun for us at least.	5	1
I mean, if I'm invited. I don't want to assume.	5	1
You're invited. I'm not sure who else is.	5	1
I went through his Rolodex.	5	1
I crossed out all the clients and everyone he's fired.	5	1
That doesn't leave a lot of people.	5	1
Freddy Rumsen doesn't come to parties.	5	1
You have to invite Harry.	5	1
I know, but he really doesn't like him.	5	1
Really?	5	1
I didn't say anything.	5	1
- Frank Keller, his accountant? - He likes him.	5	1
There are six phone numbers for Herman Phillips.	5	1
- Is he important? - That's Duck.	5	1
What birthday is it?	5	1
How'd he do?	5	1
He was fussy the whole time.	5	1
But the elevator always knocks him out.	5	1
It must be the vibration.	5	1
Who would have thought you'd be so good at this?	5	1
You'll be good at it, too, sweetheart.	5	1
What am I going to do when you go home?	5	1
Are you really going back to that office?	5	1
- You worked. - I had to.	5	1
Your husband's a doctor.	5	1
It doesn't matter.	5	1
I promised, and they need me.	5	1
I'm not saying you're not important to them,	5	1
but they also know that priorities change.	5	1
- They should, anyway. - Why are you doing this?	5	1
You don't know how sick you're going to feel inside	5	1
or what you're going to miss.	5	1
What he's doing now, that's nothing.	5	1
- Just wait. - I know, I know.	5	1
I just...	5	1
I don't want to break my promise.	5	1
And Greg will be stationed at Fort Dix for a second year.	5	1
I can commute from New Jersey.	5	1
And then?	5	1
And then, when he's done,	5	1
we'll see.	5	1
Joan, he's not going to allow you to work.	5	1
Allow me?	5	1
Whither thou goest, I will go.	5	1
And how did that work out for you?	5	1
Pete Campbell. Late as usual.	5	1
He obviously didn't come in on a Mohawk plane.	5	1
Hank. Jack.	5	1
You're not late. Roger told us to come early.	5	1
Have a seat. You're only one behind, but they're nuclear.	5	1
Roger, they're looking for you back in the office.	5	1
It'll keep.	5	1
We were just laughing about Y&R.	5	1
It couldn't have happened to a better bunch of bigots.	5	1
Roger, it's an emergency.	5	1
Really?	5	1
Oh, come on. We just got started.	5	1
AII right, all right. Sorry, fellas.	5	1
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.	5	1
You don't want me to fly copilot or be your wingman?	5	1
Check your valises? Hold your airsickness bag?	5	1
Do you want me to throw one into the bag you're in?	5	1
You enjoy yourself, then. Garçon, assume that these are gone.	5	1
I should warn you about these two. They're a thirsty lot.	5	1
Always a pleasure.	5	1
When you're done with him, just fold him up and slide him under the door.	5	1
I love that guy.	5	1
And so we take advantage of this new microphotography	5	1
and high-speed camera to show...	5	1
A bean ballet.	5	1
Spinning in air with their delicious perfection,	5	1
the beans pirouette in slow motion, they somersault in slow motion.	5	1
Some of them spin clockwise, some counter-clockwise	5	1
so they'll appear to be moving towards each other.	5	1
Until...	5	1
They drop into a full can, first seen from the top.	5	1
There's a splash of mouth-watering sauce as each one lands.	5	1
Then we cut to the front, the iconic label.	5	1
"""The art of supper."""	5	1
Have you done this before, this special photography?	5	1
It's been done before, but you'll be the first on TV.	5	1
How do they get the beans to do that? They can't just get lucky.	5	1
This camera can show a bullet spinning in midair.	5	1
Where's the bite and smile?	5	1
Ken, you said there'd be a bite and smile on the phone.	5	1
I think I said there was going to be a bean ballet, Raymond,	5	1
but I'm sure we can add that.	5	1
And what do they take away from it?	5	1
It puts beans on their mind.	5	1
It's an unforgettable image. And believe it or not, it makes them exciting.	5	1
And it'll show you have a sense of humor	5	1
because, really, they're being portrayed as far more important than they are.	5	1
You ever see beans up close?	5	1
They're slimy. They look like a bunch of bloody organs.	5	1
And it's not just for fellas like me that saw things in Korea.	5	1
Kidney beans are called kidney beans because they're shaped that way.	5	1
But you could call all beans that.	5	1
They look better in a group, in a bowl.	5	1
Hell, what's wrong with a spoon?	5	1
Don.	5	1
- Well, hello, Don. - Hello, Raymond.	5	1
Good to see you. Are you as excited about this as we are?	5	1
I don't know.	5	1
You said to be bold. Nothing on TV is going to look like this.	5	1
And just imagine seeing one of these dancing beans on the subway wall.	5	1
People will hear the music in their heads.	5	1
Look, it's very artistic.	5	1
And I want to be bold,	5	1
but this isn't what I had in mind	5	1
when I was talking about a new generation of consumers.	5	1
The ketchup kids, are they even going to notice this?	5	1
I mean, that waltz alone reminds me of old people.	5	1
Maybe I wasn't clear.	5	1
This is temporary music. We can change it.	5	1
It's got no message.	5	1
I can see your point.	5	1
Beans...	5	1
Is the war, the Depression, bomb shelters.	5	1
We have to erase that.	5	1
They have to be cool. Don, you know what I'm talking about.	5	1
I want the kids in college.	5	1
It's convenient. They have the hot plate. They're sitting in.	5	1
Okay. We'll work on that.	5	1
"Maybe it's someone with a picket sign saying, ""We want beans."""	5	1
You know what, Raymond? This is ourjob from here on out.	5	1
We'll make you happy.	5	1
I'm really sorry about that.	5	1
Please, this is a process.	5	1
Let me walk you out.	5	1
What else you got?	5	1
That was the best thing so far.	5	1
Unless you like this beans protest.	5	1
Please, you can't be surprised that, that man doesn't have a taste for ballet.	5	1
It's a joke on ballet.	5	1
And you can't be surprised he doesn't have a sense of humor.	5	1
I'm not, but I guess I thought you'd come in here	5	1
and tell them how good it was.	5	1
Do I really want to waste an hour and a half shoving it down his throat,	5	1
only to have him pull the plug at the last minute?	5	1
This is business that came in over the transom.	5	1
We didn't pitch it.	5	1
He has every right to make us work for it.	5	1
I wish I would have known that. I would have saved this for round two.	5	1
We'll get him next time.	5	1
Caroline.	5	1
Is he in?	5	1
He's gone for the day.	5	1
Damn it. Clara.	5	1
Clara!	5	1
Oh, my goodness. What happened?	5	1
- You want me to get some tissue? - No.	5	1
I want you to tell me why Roger Sterling was at my meeting.	5	1
- I don't know. - I know.	5	1
Because he hovers over your desk like a damn U-2.	5	1
- What? - You think he's looking at your breasts?	5	1
He's looking at my calendar.	5	1
- Did she hit you? - Thank you, Clara.	5	1
You've done enough damage for today.	5	1
You need to lower your voice. Have a drink.	5	1
No, no more drinks.	5	1
Heinz looked miserable.	5	1
They're making us work for it. Don didn't seem worried.	5	1
Did you crash with Mohawk?	5	1
No, it was perfect.	5	1
Except for my deep nausea and impending headache.	5	1
Oh, and Roger made an appearance.	5	1
Well, that shows it's a good lead.	5	1
It's my lead.	5	1
Wasn't Roger in the service with Henry Lammott?	5	1
Did you do any rowing?	5	1
- You rowed? - I was a coxswain.	5	1
The boat moves because everyone pulls in the same direction.	5	1
I'm not supposed to worry about Roger. I'm supposed to worry about other agencies.	5	1
You shouldn't be worried at all. Business is stable.	5	1
Stable is that step backwards between successful and failing.	5	1
Fine, Pete.	5	1
Just don't be impatient.	5	1
You know how this works from here on out.	5	1
We start with a bunch of piddly shit,	5	1
your Topaz, your White Knight Cologne,	5	1
we add your mid-sized stuff, maybe Mohawk.	5	1
We still got Vicks, that's big.	5	1
Next, we worm our way into a few niche companies,	5	1
get something sexy in a good neighborhood,	5	1
a pharmaceutical.	5	1
Maybe if God is gracious, a car.	5	1
And then, we go public.	5	1
Open an office in Buenos Aires,	5	1
and Elvis plays at Tammy's sweet 16.	5	1
Kenny Cosgrove writes another great American novel.	5	1
You know it didn't hurt to have Roger warm them up.	5	1
There's no one better at turning a meeting into a bender.	5	1
And they love his pickled guts.	5	1
Am I going to see you at Chez Draper on Saturday?	5	1
I wish I could get overtime for it.	5	1
You ready?	5	1
We're almost done, actually.	5	1
Do you need her?	5	1
No, it's okay. It'll be here in the morning.	5	1
Great.	5	1
Big weekend plans?	5	1
It's Tuesday. I don't know.	5	1
I was talking about me. My cousin's coming in.	5	1
Stan, assume that you're working.	5	1
Good night.	5	1
You're amazing.	5	1
It could have been worse.	5	1
"I almost said, ""I'm sorry I can't make it."""	5	1
You're not going?	5	1
No, my cousin's on shore leave. He's only got two days.	5	1
A little notice would have been nice.	5	1
I would have loved to have seen the look on Don's face.	5	1
You almost just saw it.	5	1
Like we have nothing else to do.	5	1
Did you believe him in there?	5	1
The guy didn't like it. What was he supposed to say?	5	1
What he usually says.	5	1
"""Hey, buddy, you got such great ideas, open your own agency."""	5	1
The clients are right all of a sudden? I don't recognize that man.	5	1
He's kind and patient.	5	1
And it galls you.	5	1
No, it concerns me.	5	1
Where are you going?	5	1
I've got tickets to the bean ballet and the curtain's about to go up.	5	1
Never gets old.	5	1
You're home late.	5	1
I thought I was going to have to walk home from the station,	5	1
but luckily there was a cab driver leaving a bar.	5	1
How was your day?	5	1
I didn't want to disturb you.	5	1
This becomes a home the minute you walk through that door.	5	1
There's no fruit to my labor, Tweety.	5	1
Well, I suppose none of this counts.	5	1
An acre of land, a wife, a child.	5	1
That has nothing to do with work.	5	1
I'm ungrateful.	5	1
I'm sorry.	5	1
Dissatisfaction is a symptom of ambition.	5	1
It's the coal that fuels the fire. You know that.	5	1
Do you really want a dog?	5	1
Maybe just a beagle to scare off gophers.	5	1
We'll see.	5	1
Oh, luckily my parents can baby-sit Saturday.	5	1
Now, tell me the truth. Did Megan really just invite you today?	5	1
She did. I don't know about everyone else.	5	1
Well, she's very impulsive. We know that.	5	1
I have to go to bed. Tammy will be up in a hour.	5	1
Go ahead.	5	1
Attention, party guests.	5	1
Hello.	5	1
We're T-minus five minutes or so.	5	1
So, if we can bring things down to a sotto voce,	5	1
that would help.	5	1
I'm gonna turn off the lights.	5	1
No!	5	1
Well, fine. Just keep it down.	5	1
My God, is he queer.	5	1
He reminds me of Lane's brother.	5	1
Finally.	5	1
We're gonna go inside in a second.	5	1
You're the one that dragged me out of the restaurant.	5	1
Come on.	5	1
You have to knock. You have to knock to get in.	5	1
What if it's started already?	5	1
It doesn't matter if it's started, you still have to knock.	5	1
No.	5	1
We were just in the neighborhood.	5	1
And my mother always said never show up empty-handed.	5	1
Oh, damn it.	5	1
No.	5	1
Surprise!	5	1
Sorry, I blew it in the hall.	5	1
But I am very surprised.	5	1
Don.	5	1
I have to say that I am honored and touched	5	1
to be included in this group of intimates.	5	1
And I predicted this, did I not?	5	1
This.	5	1
Who is this?	5	1
Oh, that's my wife.	5	1
Hi.	5	1
- Nice to meet you. - Charmed.	5	1
The domino theory is not a joke.	5	1
The Vietnamese are fighting a civil war.	5	1
There is no monolithic communism.	5	1
- It's an excuse. - Really?	5	1
Come on, Bert. It's for profit.	5	1
Bombs are the perfect product.	5	1
They cost a fortune and you only use them once.	5	1
So, I suppose this young man here is coming home in a bag for nothing.	5	1
If he's lucky. You ever read Johnny Got His Gun?	5	1
No eyes, no ears, no nose, tapping out his last wishes in Morse Code	5	1
with his deformed head.	5	1
I thought there were going to be girls here.	5	1
For purely selfish reasons, I want to thank you for excluding Joan.	5	1
I would have had to buy earplugs for the ride home.	5	1
It wasn't up to me. Can't you tell?	5	1
Hell of a party. Jennifer couldn't make it.	5	1
- I'm sorry to hear that. - No, she couldn't get a date.	5	1
Anyway, I know she said no gifts, but I got you this.	5	1
Open it.	5	1
You don't have to if you don't want to.	5	1
It's a silver-handled walking stick.	5	1
Oh, look, he got you a cane.	5	1
Don Ameche has one. It's a Steinway walking stick.	5	1
You could stick it up your ass and have a concert.	5	1
Thank you very much.	5	1
Oh, my God, really?	5	1
A negro homosexual, a Canadian sexpot, and unaccompanied redhead.	5	1
I think this may be my key demographic.	5	1
Don't. Just leave it alone.	5	1
I know.	5	1
You're wondering what they're laughing about.	5	1
It's not you.	5	1
Well, I, for one, think you're very brave, Megan.	5	1
My mother always said	5	1
a woman should surprise her husband every day.	5	1
That's why they had no lock on the WC.	5	1
It's true.	5	1
Look at you delivering drinks. We should get you a pair of roller skates.	5	1
Roger, I didn't know you were invited.	5	1
Or did you just hear I was coming and show up?	5	1
Is he going bald?	5	1
It just goes on and on.	5	1
It's beautiful, but it's very loud.	5	1
Listen, you can hear the traffic even over this party.	5	1
I know.	5	1
Who cares? I just want to take my pants off and slide my ass on the carpet.	5	1
How's the summer treating you?	5	1
Well, it's been good because it's been bad.	5	1
What do you do exactly?	5	1
He's a journalist.	5	1
Underground papers mostly.	5	1
You may not have seen it.	5	1
And what exactly has been bad?	5	1
Well, I don't know. Four riots in three cities in two months.	5	1
It is terrible. And Lord knows the police aren't much help.	5	1
I was raised sex, politics, and religion aren't party talk.	5	1
Well, what does that leave?	5	1
I don't know. Alcohol and work?	5	1
Hello again.	5	1
Trudes, which one is Jane Sterling again?	5	1
The glamour puss with the tan.	5	1
Marry early and often.	5	1
We're thinking about smoking some tea with Megan's friends out there.	5	1
- Will you keep an eye out for Don? - As long as you're just thinking about it.	5	1
You should join us. Kenny gets brave and recites poems.	5	1
And she thinks they're good.	5	1
Oh, absolutely.	5	1
Megan was the best waitress they ever had.	5	1
No, but I did get the best tips.	5	1
- How did you manage that? - She laid on that accent.	5	1
You know, she's a really good actress.	5	1
Not good enough, obviously.	5	1
- Julia, come here for a second. - Hello there.	5	1
Hello.	5	1
- Glad you could come. - Great party.	5	1
You got a great spread here.	5	1
I just wanted to make sure we said hi.	5	1
I can't stay that long. I have to go back and redo the Heinz pitch.	5	1
But I guess you know that.	5	1
Come on, Don.	5	1
What are you doing?	5	1
Was that bad?	5	1
Hell, look who you're talking to. How do I know?	5	1
Okay, everyone. My friends.	5	1
First of all, I wanted to thank you all for coming.	5	1
And second of all,	5	1
I think I've had just enough to drink	5	1
that I'm ready to give my own present to the birthday boy.	5	1
Thank you. Thank you all for coming.	5	1
I think we should call it a night.	5	1
Absolutely not, Don.	5	1
You stay there.	5	1
Did you buy him a pony?	5	1
Happy birthday, baby.	5	1
Why don't you sing like that?	5	1
Why don't you look like him?	5	1
Je m'appelle Roger.	5	1
If I may raise a glass.	5	1
Happy birthday, Don!	5	1
As I was saying.	5	1
To Megan,	5	1
for letting us see the Don Draper smile usually reserved for clients.	5	1
Hear, hear!	5	1
And to Don,	5	1
you lucky so and so.	5	1
As a wise man once said,	5	1
the only thing worse than not getting what you want	5	1
is someone else getting it.	5	1
Okay, now, no one has called and complained,	5	1
so there's no reason everyone shouldn't dance.	5	1
I should probably clean up.	5	1
Leave it for the girl.	5	1
She doesn't come till Monday.	5	1
Call her and have her come tomorrow.	5	1
And Monday.	5	1
Problem solved.	5	1
Did you have fun?	5	1
Move over.	5	1
No, I just want to sleep.	5	1
Oh, come on.	5	1
I know you had a good time. I can see it.	5	1
I don't want to talk. I just want to go to sleep.	5	1
Hey.	5	1
Don't waste money on things like that.	5	1
It was my money,	5	1
and you don't get to decide what I do with it.	5	1
Well, could you please not use it to embarrass me again?	5	1
What?	5	1
I know why you're upset.	5	1
You're 40.	5	1
I've been 40 for half a year.	5	1
When is that gonna stop? Only you know that.	5	1
This is your birthday now.	5	1
Fine,	5	1
I don't like my birthday.	5	1
I told you, I never had it when I was growing up and	5	1
I've never wanted it since.	5	1
You never had a birthday?	5	1
Didn't Betty ever throw you a party?	5	1
No, because I forbid it.	5	1
Why?	5	1
I don't need to be the center of attention.	5	1
You love attention.	5	1
You twitched every time I talked to another person.	5	1
More people feel the way I do than the way you do.	5	1
Where's your research?	5	1
Fine, I'm 40.	5	1
It's too late.	5	1
Nobody loves Dick Whitman.	5	1
I love you.	5	1
That's why I threw you a party.	5	1
I'm going to sleep.	5	1
You can do what you want.	5	1
Excuse me. Someone's left...	5	1
There's a wallet here from some previous passenger.	5	1
I'll turn it in to dispatch. They got a lost and found.	5	1
There's close to $100.	5	1
Yeah, it happens all the time.	5	1
I'd feel better if I saw to its return.	5	1
You're putting me in a jam here. The guy's gonna call looking for it.	5	1
That's me.	5	1
You know what? You do what you got to do, mister.	5	1
That's for you.	5	1
High tides and heavy surf	5	1
battered the coast of North Carolina today.	5	1
Force 20 winds and heavy rain forced evacuation	5	1
along the coast as far inland as three miles.	5	1
That was quite a soiree.	5	1
Did Masters and Johnson come in yet?	5	1
They haven't passed by.	5	1
I should come and sit down so I can see them slink in, in shame.	5	1
You seem to be in fine spirits.	5	1
Well, I didn't get into too much trouble on Saturday.	5	1
Plus, Mohawk called me at home this morning.	5	1
I hate to interrupt, Mr. Pryce, but I have your wife.	5	1
- Which line? - Three.	5	1
- It's blinking. - They're all blinking.	5	1
Three.	5	1
- If you don't mind. - I've called a partners' meeting.	5	1
Hello, dearest.	5	1
Look, I know you were upset when you left,	5	1
and perhaps I'm overreacting.	5	1
Becca, dear,	5	1
this is why I don't like you opening the mail.	5	1
I only want to ensure that Nigel is enrolled in the fall.	5	1
Nigel's enrollment isn't an issue whether we pay now or not.	5	1
Then why would they attach such a threatening letter to a bill?	5	1
Wouldn't you rather have your money in June than September if you were them?	5	1
Well, I worry about them saving his spot for him,	5	1
especially with his marks.	5	1
I assure you that St. Paul's is aware that we plan on having him return	5	1
and simply wishes to earn whatever interest they can	5	1
on the full amount for the next three months.	5	1
Couldn't you spare that interest in exchange for my peace of mind?	5	1
Lane, darling?	5	1
What? I'm sorry. I didn't get that last bit.	5	1
Nothing.	5	1
Don't forget to get the name of Megan's real estate agent.	5	1
Yes, dear.	5	1
And her decorator.	5	1
Apolo, you're so good with him.	5	1
I wasn't expecting you back so soon.	5	1
First in line at the post office. It wasn't that bad.	5	1
Hello, Miss Joan.	5	1
Sink is draining.	5	1
Turns out it was a lemon peel.	5	1
I'm sure you know we're appreciative, but Mother and I have so much to do.	5	1
I am busy, busy, too.	5	1
You don't have to rush off.	5	1
He doesn't have to rush off, does he?	5	1
When you need Apolo, you call Apolo.	5	1
Miss Joan.	5	1
I want him to hear. That was just rude.	5	1
It is one thing to have him work here,	5	1
it is another thing to give him cake and my baby.	5	1
His fingers have been in every toilet from here to the Bowery.	5	1
He brought the cookies.	5	1
If you want to go on a date with him, just ask.	5	1
He's married with four children.	5	1
I'm just making sure this apartment gets his attention.	5	1
This apartment has never had any trouble getting his attention.	5	1
Yes, Joanie. Everyone's staring at you.	5	1
You know you're not exactly at your fighting weight.	5	1
Try me.	5	1
You asked me to come out here.	5	1
You can go home any time you want.	5	1
You should think before you say that.	5	1
I got my money's worth.	5	1
Well, I wasn't going to show you this.	5	1
That doesn't make any sense.	5	1
Look, I'm sure it's not the way anyone wants you to find out.	5	1
No, it's not in the want ads.	5	1
And, honestly, they don't have the money for more people.	5	1
It's not more people. It's you.	5	1
You love stirring the shit.	5	1
I am telling you something you don't want to hear,	5	1
and you are making this very painful for me.	5	1
Megan Draperjust invited me to her party.	5	1
At the very last minute. Don't tell me that girl's not conniving.	5	1
You think she wants you around her husband?	5	1
I'm going to lie down.	5	1
Sometimes life makes decisions for you.	5	1
- Have a good day. - Okay.	5	1
I know your birthday was last week,	5	1
and I was told you don't celebrate it and not to bring it up.	5	1
Now I feel like I got caught with my pants down,	5	1
so I got you a little something.	5	1
It's a plant.	5	1
I just wanted to say happy birthday.	5	1
Kiss-ass.	5	1
Thank you.	5	1
I can get you some coffee, but there's a partners' meeting.	5	1
- Nobody's there. - It's in Mr. Campbell's office.	5	1
- You want to smile? - Is it your obituary?	5	1
No, it's the little salt we rubbed in Y&R's wound.	5	1
It's beautiful, no?	5	1
- That's Mr. Campbell. - Shall we?	5	1
What?	5	1
We don't make fun of each other's wives here. Understood?	5	1
Come on, I wasn't making fun of her. I was making fun of you.	5	1
- You're happy. - I am.	5	1
Well, I want you to be happy.	5	1
Somebody should be.	5	1
You know, two weeks ago,	5	1
"Jane asked me, ""Which one's Mussolini?"""	5	1
No, it's good. She's a great girl.	5	1
They're all great girls. At least until they want something.	5	1
Let's go.	5	1
They're just leaving now.	5	1
What, did they stop for a drink?	5	1
Well, why don't you get off your rear, find them, and tell them I'm about...	5	1
They're here.	5	1
Gentlemen, if you could slide over a bit.	5	1
- A marvelous fete. - Oh, yes.	5	1
I have instructions from Trudy to thank both of you.	5	1
- Why are we meeting in here? - Why are we here?	5	1
Please, don't smoke in here. I spent the morning choking on the train.	5	1
So, Mohawk is coming in. I've brought them in.	5	1
- What do you know about that? - That's great news.	5	1
- When? - I don't know.	5	1
AII I was thinking is that I bring Henry and Jack in here	5	1
to this very gathering of individuals, but I have one question.	5	1
Where are they going to sit?	5	1
I mean, what kind of impression does this space give you?	5	1
Do you gaze upon the cement column and think,	5	1
"""Yes, I believe success for me and my company dwells here."""	5	1
Why don't you take them to the conference room?	5	1
Because it's not that meeting.	5	1
Fine, we'll have it in my office.	5	1
This does not involve you, Roger.	5	1
Nor does Vicks, Playtex, Life cereal, Samsonite,	5	1
Sugarberry Ham, Secor Laxative.	5	1
Need I go on?	5	1
What are you suggesting?	5	1
He's suggesting that you give him your office.	5	1
- No, he's not. - Yes, I am.	5	1
Well, forget it.	5	1
Where am I supposed to conduct business?	5	1
In the crapper, for all I care.	5	1
I'm a full partner and you're a junior, so sorry, Charlie, but them's the breaks.	5	1
Gentlemen, I'm sure we can find an equitable solution to this.	5	1
- There's no need for a row. - You're right.	5	1
I say we put it to a vote.	5	1
I say we step outside.	5	1
I didn't think so.	5	1
Good work on Mohawk.	5	1
Thank you, but I'm dead serious about this.	5	1
I have too much responsibility and too much business	5	1
to apply my skills in this environment.	5	1
You all know it.	5	1
We'll buy more space.	5	1
- If we're handing out offices... - Absolutely not.	5	1
I can't extend our credit line any further.	5	1
It'll work itself out.	5	1
Congratulations.	5	1
When are they coming in?	5	1
I'm still not sure they should, considering the situation.	5	1
Great party, Don.	5	1
Absolutely.	5	1
I couldn't sleep.	5	1
Those tits and that mouth.	5	1
She's such a sex kitten.	5	1
That whole dance. How did he just sit there?	5	1
You can't stand up once you get in that condition.	5	1
I would have. I would have just stood up and grabbed her little French behind	5	1
and pushed her through those cheap post-war walls.	5	1
- Hi, Megan. - Very funny.	5	1
God, what I would do to her.	5	1
Like what, for example?	5	1
I'll tell you what.	5	1
I would love to see those heels on my shoulder.	5	1
"""Je voudrais mas Harry."""	5	1
Good morning.	5	1
Great party.	5	1
Thrilled to be included. Jennifer was very jealous.	5	1
I think I'm gonna die.	5	1
You could have warned me.	5	1
I did.	5	1
I have the owner of the wallet returning your call.	5	1
Thank you.	5	1
- Hello. - Hello, Mr. Pryce.	5	1
I'm calling for Alex Polito.	5	1
- And who is this? - This is his girl, Delores.	5	1
Well, when he comes into the office,	5	1
I think I should speak with him personally.	5	1
I'm not his secretary. I'm his girl.	5	1
I'm like his wife, but I can't call myself that.	5	1
You don't sound happy about that.	5	1
- Excuse me? - I'm married myself.	5	1
Good for you. What's her name?	5	1
Rebecca. Rebecca Pryce. Well, obviously.	5	1
- That's a pretty name. - I suppose so.	5	1
She enjoys it.	5	1
Do you think she's home right now, lying in bed, talking to a stranger?	5	1
I should hope not.	5	1
So, you have Alex's wallet?	5	1
Yes, I do.	5	1
- And where are you? - I'm at my offices in Midtown.	5	1
Are you in big business?	5	1
Excuse me?	5	1
Are you in a big office building?	5	1
Yes.	5	1
That's why I don't have the luxury of lying around at 11:00 in my underthings.	5	1
I didn't tell you that part.	5	1
You didn't say I was incorrect, either.	5	1
Where the hell are you from?	5	1
You sound like Cary Grant.	5	1
I told you, Midtown.	5	1
Why don't I...	5	1
Listen, I really should return this, you know, the wallet.	5	1
I could slip it in the post or...	5	1
Of course, you know, that has its disadvantages.	5	1
There's a bit of cash here.	5	1
Or I could hand-deliver it.	5	1
Is this a current address?	5	1
I don't know.	5	1
I don't know if that would be proper.	5	1
No, of course.	5	1
Why don't you meet me at my place of business?	5	1
I'll give you the address or have my secretary help you.	5	1
Yeah. Why don't we do that?	5	1
And I'll come by when I can.	5	1
Well, I'll be here the rest of my life.	5	1
Just a minute.	5	1
I look forward to it.	5	1
Why not?	5	1
Toodle-oo.	5	1
That's cute.	5	1
Scarlett, would you give this woman directions to our office?	5	1
She's on line three.	5	1
Mr. Crane, Mr. Sterling has requested you in his office.	5	1
Is there a meeting?	5	1
He just came over here, said he needed to see you, and walked away.	5	1
- Why didn't he come in? - I don't know.	5	1
He knows you're in there.	5	1
Okay. Okay. Did you see him talking to Megan or Don?	5	1
I've been working.	5	1
- What did you do? - Nothing!	5	1
You wanted to see me?	5	1
I did. Come in, have a seat.	5	1
No, that's okay.	5	1
I think you should have a seat.	5	1
Okay.	5	1
Now,	5	1
I think you know that we like to think of this place as a family.	5	1
And there are certain ways a family behaves.	5	1
What did she say? You have to hear my side of it.	5	1
Your side of what?	5	1
What... Nothing.	5	1
You're always up to something, aren't you, Crane?	5	1
It was an honest mistake and I consider myself reprimanded.	5	1
Great.	5	1
I was thinking Pete could take your office.	5	1
Really?	5	1
Look, I will apologize face to face,	5	1
as horrible as that will be, but I think you're...	5	1
There's no reason to let me go.	5	1
You're not getting fired.	5	1
And what the hell did you do?	5	1
I made fun of Zou Bisou.	5	1
So did I.	5	1
Is that a crime? No.	5	1
I tried to get Jane to talk to me in that accent. Nothing doing.	5	1
She doesn't speak French. She doesn't like me.	5	1
I went home after and Jennifer didn't know what was coming.	5	1
- I was like... - I don't want to hear that.	5	1
No, of course you don't. Why would you?	5	1
Look, I think you can understand that Pete needs a bigger office.	5	1
And just between you, me, and the window washer,	5	1
it's been decided that you should trade.	5	1
- Who decided that? - I did.	5	1
I can't do that. And I don't know that I have to do it.	5	1
Do I?	5	1
Harry.	5	1
I'm asking you as a friend.	5	1
And I appreciate that, Roger, I really do, but I need my office.	5	1
Look, first of all, Pete's office isn't that different.	5	1
- I disagree. - Fine.	5	1
Name the most important person you could bring into this office.	5	1
William Paley.	5	1
Okay, so you shouldn't do that.	5	1
Trust me, network and studio executives want to think you're out there jet-setting,	5	1
rubbing shoulders with television stars and chorus girls.	5	1
You should be talking to clients ringside	5	1
or at a three-star restaurant, not coming into your miserable little office.	5	1
But I do. I come in here almost every day.	5	1
And Pete's office is a shithole with a support beam.	5	1
What if I were to make it worth your while?	5	1
I'm already head of my department.	5	1
What would be an appropriate bonus?	5	1
There's no bonuses. We have no money.	5	1
How much would it take?	5	1
Well, first of all, it's more than you could have on you.	5	1
Really?	5	1
That's $1,100.	5	1
Why do you carry so much cash?	5	1
It's more than 1,000, Harry.	5	1
That is a month's salary after taxes.	5	1
There's no window in there.	5	1
You could buy yourself a very beautiful picture of something to look at.	5	1
Well, okay. But you're gonna owe me.	5	1
No, I'm not. I just gave you a lot of money.	5	1
This is a transaction. And if you don't like it,	5	1
we can have the conversation you thought we were having.	5	1
- So this is every month? - Get the hell out of my office.	5	1
Excuse me. I'm sorry.	5	1
I'm Joan.	5	1
I'm Meredith. Can I help you?	5	1
Joan Harris.	5	1
I work here.	5	1
Worked here. I've been on leave.	5	1
Joan. My goodness.	5	1
It's hard to believe you just had a baby.	5	1
You don't know where I started.	5	1
Do you want me to announce you?	5	1
No, I'll let myself in.	5	1
Are you sure?	5	1
No one mentioned a new girl.	5	1
I guess they needed someone up here because Scarlett is now covering Mr. Pryce	5	1
so that she can do the books with Clara.	5	1
Well, now I can understand why I wasn't told.	5	1
Oh, my God. My mouth.	5	1
Could you just help me with the door?	5	1
He's adorable.	5	1
Please don't be mad at me for telling you that.	5	1
I'm very happy being nobody here.	5	1
I know a girl who had yourjob who ended up with everything.	5	1
Where would you like to visit first?	5	1
I suppose my office.	5	1
Yes, yes, absolutely. Joan.	5	1
My goodness, you look radiant.	5	1
- Can I see him? - I don't see why not.	5	1
- Where's Scarlett? - Go fetch Caroline.	5	1
Joanie.	5	1
Look at you out and about.	5	1
Yes, we're gonna stop by The Copa later.	5	1
One of us badly needs a drink.	5	1
Lane made it very clear we're not hiring anybody.	5	1
I don't care how buxom his mother is.	5	1
Don.	5	1
- Look at that. - He's okay.	5	1
Hello, Megan.	5	1
Hello, Joan.	5	1
I'm sure I'm not ruining any surprises at this point,	5	1
but how was your party? I'm sorry I missed it.	5	1
He's adorable.	5	1
Are we welcoming you back?	5	1
- That was my impression. - Today?	5	1
- Do you want to hold him? - What?	5	1
He's a little cabbage.	5	1
It's just a matter of time, Don.	5	1
I should be getting back to work.	5	1
I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead.	5	1
Joanie, I'll say what I said when you left here,	5	1
this is not a good excuse.	5	1
Nice to see you.	5	1
- When are you coming back? - I was planning on three weeks.	5	1
My mother's leaving any day, so I was gonna hire a girl.	5	1
It's gonna be terrible to leave him.	5	1
Joan.	5	1
I was wondering if you were going to visit.	5	1
My hands are dirty.	5	1
Oh, my God. He looks just like you.	5	1
I should get back to work. I have more than ever, thanks to you, Joan.	5	1
Good.	5	1
So, how are you?	5	1
Well, well, well.	5	1
There's my baby.	5	1
Now move that brat out of the way so I can see her.	5	1
Hello, Roger.	5	1
Little dud like my present?	5	1
I'm sure you're aware that a bicycle's not useful yet, Uncle Roger.	5	1
Oh, no? He's a loafer?	5	1
He's been keeping me awake. He needs constant attention.	5	1
Is that right? Let me see that.	5	1
Has anyone even seen this baby with you walking next to him?	5	1
Scarlett. Scarlett, may I see you?	5	1
I got it.	5	1
Mr. Pryce, Mrs. Harris is here to see you.	5	1
- Send her in. - I've got him.	5	1
Caroline, I need you to make dinner reservations right away.	5	1
I'll be right back.	5	1
This really is an unexpected pleasure.	5	1
Just stopping by.	5	1
Anything I should know about?	5	1
Yes, actually. Pressing business.	5	1
Would you mind?	5	1
No, not at all.	5	1
What are we supposed to do with him?	5	1
Better than the steps of a church, I guess.	5	1
Have either of you seen Clara?	5	1
No.	5	1
What's that?	5	1
It's Joan's little boy.	5	1
That's darling.	5	1
Would you please take him and give him back to Joan?	5	1
Do I suddenly appear to be wearing a skirt?	5	1
Spectacular party.	5	1
Just take him. You should say hello to Joan anyways.	5	1
Clara?	5	1
She looks very good.	5	1
She does. She looked good at nine months.	5	1
I don't know about that.	5	1
I'm surprised you didn't tell her.	5	1
- Tell her what? - That she looked terrible.	5	1
You seem to say whatever's on your mind.	5	1
Is something wrong?	5	1
No.	5	1
I got the Vicks coupons done.	5	1
I know you thought you were the only one working this weekend.	5	1
No, I didn't.	5	1
Really? That's what you said to Don.	5	1
I know. I had too much to drink and...	5	1
And you couldn't resist saying something obnoxious?	5	1
Well, just so we're clear, I put in a lot of work on Heinz. So did you.	5	1
You can't even apologize. None of you can.	5	1
- I'm sorry. - You're sorry?	5	1
What is wrong with you people?	5	1
You're all so cynical. You don't smile. You smirk.	5	1
Is he mad at me?	5	1
I don't care.	5	1
Who wouldn't want a surprise party?	5	1
I don't feel well.	5	1
Megan...	5	1
No, really, I don't feel well.	5	1
Am I allowed to go home?	5	1
Of course.	5	1
I'm so sorry. You were right.	5	1
I apologize.	5	1
It's fine.	5	1
Heinz won't sign off on the work.	5	1
So they won't be back in for 30 days,	5	1
which means we won't get paid for another 90.	5	1
And we're about to shoot Christmas ads for Sugarberry and Vicks.	5	1
But they won't run until Christmas,	5	1
so we won't get paid until Easter.	5	1
Well, that explains why you're asking me for all this free advice.	5	1
I'm just trying to get things in order.	5	1
So that you can eliminate my job?	5	1
What? Absolutely not.	5	1
- Then why did you run an ad? - What ad?	5	1
- In this morning's Times. - Oh, that.	5	1
That wasn't an ad.	5	1
Well, what the hell was it, then?	5	1
It was some private barb directed at Y&R.	5	1
Mrs. Harris, the books have practically been held together	5	1
with spit in your absence.	5	1
What about Scarlett and Clara splitting my work?	5	1
Splitting?	5	1
The two of them together couldn't operate a parking meter. They're imbeciles.	5	1
Well, that was a dumb thing to do.	5	1
Oh, there, there.	5	1
I'm sorry.	5	1
I've been like this since the baby.	5	1
And it's not him.	5	1
I just	5	1
keep thinking about what's going on here, and I missed it too much.	5	1
It's too embarrassing.	5	1
Nothing's happened.	5	1
Something always happens. Things are different.	5	1
Somebody tells a joke and you don't know what they're talking about.	5	1
There have been no jokes, not without you.	5	1
Not even at my expense?	5	1
I'm terribly adrift without you.	5	1
It's just a matter of time before they find out I'm a sham.	5	1
Nobody came to visit me.	5	1
They sent flowers with some stupid card written by the florist.	5	1
There would have been a cake, but you weren't here to arrange it.	5	1
It's just...	5	1
And I don't expect you to understand this,	5	1
but my husband's been gone so long.	5	1
And I know he's coming home soon.	5	1
And even with my baby there and my mother,	5	1
I feel alone.	5	1
It's home, but it's not everything.	5	1
I do understand.	5	1
Now, I won't have everyone thinking I've made you cry.	5	1
Well, at least tell me about the party.	5	1
Mrs. Draper put on a bit of a burlesque.	5	1
- No. - Oh, yes.	5	1
She danced and sang in front of all of us.	5	1
She was quite the coquette.	5	1
I can't do it justice.	5	1
And Don?	5	1
I saw his soul leave his body.	5	1
I can't even imagine how handsome that man must be blushing.	5	1
Yes.	5	1
I don't know how I ended up with him, but...	5	1
Thank you so much.	5	1
Mr. Pryce, I will be speaking with you.	5	1
Let me take a look at him at least.	5	1
Handsome little blagger.	5	1
Have you seen Clara?	5	1
Congratulations. We're gonna be right next to each other finally.	5	1
What's going on?	5	1
Clara, could you excuse us?	5	1
Well, she obviously already knows.	5	1
Please.	5	1
Roger, you know, convinced me.	5	1
We all thought it was best for the firm that you have a bigger office,	5	1
so I was asked to switch.	5	1
I'll be right back.	5	1
I appreciate your sacrifice, but a bigger office was not the point.	5	1
Well, fine, then. I'll switch back.	5	1
Roger didn't say I couldn't switch back.	5	1
I don't care what Roger says. I am the head of accounts.	5	1
I am bringing in all the business. I deserve the bigger office.	5	1
It's a great office, Pete.	5	1
It's very important.	5	1
It's got the windows. God, I'm gonna miss them.	5	1
And you did this because Roger told you to?	5	1
And also because I respect you so much.	5	1
What do you want me to say?	5	1
Look, I just need a place to hide until Megan leaves.	5	1
Oh, God, unless she told Don.	5	1
She's not gonna tell Don, is she?	5	1
I don't know what you're talking about.	5	1
Come in.	5	1
What's up?	5	1
At your party, which was lovely,	5	1
I said something which I shouldn't have said,	5	1
and I want to apologize if you had a bad time because of it.	5	1
I had a wonderful time.	5	1
Well, good.	5	1
The only reason I'm bringing it up is Megan seemed kind of upset.	5	1
I'm very sorry.	5	1
I should not be allowed to drink at work functions.	5	1
Or at all, honestly.	5	1
- What did she say? - Nothing.	5	1
But she went home. She wasn't feeling well.	5	1
I'm mortified if I had something to do with it.	5	1
When did she leave?	5	1
I think she wants to be alone.	5	1
You don't know her at all.	5	1
Caroline.	5	1
I'm done for the day.	5	1
Mr. Pryce.	5	1
Yes, Scarlett?	5	1
There's a gentleman here, the owner of the wallet, Mr. Polito.	5	1
He's in reception. Shall I bring him back?	5	1
No, absolutely not.	5	1
Well, do you want to see him?	5	1
Yes, I'll be out in a moment.	5	1
Of course, Mr. Pryce.	5	1
Thank you, Delores.	5	1
- Excuse me? - I said... Just a minute.	5	1
Hello.	5	1
Are you Mr. Polito?	5	1
I am. Although there's no way for you to know that.	5	1
You got my wallet.	5	1
I contacted you.	5	1
Thank you.	5	1
Well, I'm glad this worked out.	5	1
Hold on.	5	1
Just hold on a second.	5	1
Everything's there.	5	1
So it is.	5	1
Well, you can't blame me.	5	1
My horse came in and then I lost my wallet.	5	1
Then it came in again.	5	1
No, that's not necessary.	5	1
- You've got to take a reward. - I couldn't possibly.	5	1
My girl said you were real polite.	5	1
Obviously from the accent, you're not from around here.	5	1
No, I'm not.	5	1
This is the way we do things.	5	1
Thanks again. I mean it.	5	1
You're a real gentleman.	5	1
Megan? Where are you?	5	1
You're home.	5	1
So are you. What happened?	5	1
Nothing.	5	1
You just left without me?	5	1
- I was upset. - That's clear.	5	1
About what?	5	1
Because my apartment is filthy.	5	1
Where's the girl?	5	1
I sent her home.	5	1
What are you doing?	5	1
I'm cleaning up. I don't want to get sweaty.	5	1
- Like that? - Don't you look at me.	5	1
I'm talking to you.	5	1
I'm cleaning up.	5	1
Really?	5	1
Stop looking at me. You aren't allowed to look at me.	5	1
Then put some clothes on.	5	1
I said stop it. You don't deserve it.	5	1
Come on.	5	1
You don't like presents. You don't like nice things.	5	1
Besides, you're too old.	5	1
I don't need an old person.	5	1
You probably couldn't do it anyway.	5	1
Don't!	5	1
- Get up. - No.	5	1
I don't want people to think you're getting this.	5	1
You want it so badly.	5	1
I don't want it. I don't want you.	5	1
You don't get to have this. Go sit over there.	5	1
AII you get to do is watch.	5	1
Where's Harry?	5	1
Who cares?	5	1
I'm sorry. Do you need to see Mr. Campbell?	5	1
No.	5	1
Is Roger Sterling still here?	5	1
Yes.	5	1
I want you to let him do whatever he wants.	5	1
And I want you to pencil in an appointment tomorrow	5	1
at the coffee shop in the ferry building in Staten Island.	5	1
6:00 a.m.	5	1
With Coca-Cola.	5	1
Okay.	5	1
That'll be all.	5	1
I don't think those people like me.	5	1
That's not true.	5	1
Well, I'm not sure I like them.	5	1
The reason I didn't want you to have that party is	5	1
I didn't want them in our home.	5	1
You've only been in the creative end of this business for three months.	5	1
And being a secretary, you don't know what goes on.	5	1
There isn't one problem that Peggy or anybody in that office has	5	1
that wasn't there before you.	5	1
You think you're a splinter?	5	1
You're not.	5	1
The whole foot's been infected for years.	5	1
I love going to work with you because	5	1
you love work and you love me.	5	1
But I wonder if maybe it's not a good idea.	5	1
I don't really care about work.	5	1
I want you at work	5	1
because I want you.	5	1
I think we have to replace the rug.	5	1
Just because you see white carpet in a magazine doesn't mean it's practical.	5	1
It's beautiful.	5	1
Well, I've taken a lot of pictures of white carpets.	5	1
You have to have four or five on hand.	5	1
I thought you wanted it.	5	1
I just wanted you to have what you want.	5	1
What are you doing?	5	1
I've got to go to Staten Island.	5	1
- What time is it? - Shut up.	5	1
An aboveground pool?	5	1
No, no, in the ground. With deck chairs.	5	1
That costs a fortune. You gonna dig it yourself?	5	1
We'll see what happens at Christmas.	5	1
I never count on a bonus.	5	1
I'm not talking to you.	5	1
I hope to be dead by Christmas.	5	1
Do you have any money for the grocer?	5	1
You told me not to write any checks.	5	1
No, of course.	5	1
He's finally gone to sleep.	5	1
We cannot call security. They are applicants.	5	1
What's going on out there?	5	1
They're all here responding to your hilarious advertisement.	5	1
Is it just me, or is the lobby full of negroes?	5	1
They saw the Y&R ad.	5	1
The humor was lost on them.	5	1
- Not on me. - It was a childish prank.	5	1
Because you're above that, right?	5	1
What are we gonna do?	5	1
Would you leave us be, dear?	5	1
Tell them the position's been filled.	5	1
There's the possibility that we could be the subject of a protest.	5	1
Then we interview them. Forever. They'll go away.	5	1
That is not a solution.	5	1
And who's to say there's not a reporter out there?	5	1
I don't know why we can't just hire one.	5	1
Because we're not hiring anyone.	5	1
Just fire that receptionist.	5	1
We can't have one out there.	5	1
- What is that? - It's from Young & Rubicam.	5	1
It's a resume.	5	1
"""1960 to '65,"	5	1
"""toted dat barge, lifted dat bale."""	5	1
Did those people out there	5	1
see that artifact come in here?	5	1
Yes. I'm positive.	5	1
Good morning.	5	1
I'd like to thank you all for coming.	5	1
First of all, we're only looking for secretaries.	5	1
So, gentlemen, you are free to leave.	5	1
I mean, you are welcome to leave.	5	1
I mean, you may go.	5	1
I will be collecting resumes,	5	1
and then those of you who meet the qualifications	5	1
will receive a call to schedule an interview.	5	1
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]	5	2
[VEHICLES HONKING]	5	2
Excuse me. Someone's left...	5	2
There's a wallet here from some previous passenger.	5	2
I'll turn it in to dispatch. They got a lost and found.	5	2
There's close to $100.	5	2
Yeah, it happens all the time.	5	2
I'd feel better if I saw to its return.	5	2
You're putting me in a jam here. The guy's gonna call looking for it.	5	2
That's me.	5	2
You know what? You do what you got to do, mister.	5	2
 That's for you.	5	2
MAN ON TV: High tides and heavy surf	5	2
battered the coast of North Carolina today.	5	2
Force 20 winds and heavy rain forced evacuation	5	2
along the coast as far inland as three miles.	5	2
That was quite a soiree.	5	2
Did Masters and Johnson come in yet?	5	2
They haven't passed by.	5	2
I should come and sit down so I can see them slink in, in shame.	5	2
You seem to be in fine spirits.	5	2
Well, I didn't get into too much trouble on Saturday.	5	2
Plus, Mohawk called me at home this morning.	5	2
Ah.	5	2
[INTERCOM BUZZES]	5	2
 SCARLETT: I hate to interrupt, Mr. Pryce, but I have your wife.	5	2
- Which line? - Three.	5	2
- It's blinking. - They're all blinking.	5	2
Three.	5	2
- If you don't mind. - I've called a partners' meeting.	5	2
Hello, dearest.	5	2
Look, I know you were upset when you left,	5	2
and perhaps I'm overreacting.	5	2
Becca, dear,	5	2
this is why I don't like you opening the mail.	5	2
I only want to ensure that Nigel is enrolled in the fall.	5	2
Nigel's enrollment isn't an issue whether we pay now or not.	5	2
Then why would they attach such a threatening letter to a bill?	5	2
Wouldn't you rather have your money in June than September if you were them?	5	2
Well, I worry about them saving his spot for him,	5	2
especially with his marks.	5	2
I assure you that St. Paul's is aware that we plan on having him return	5	2
and simply wishes to earn whatever interest they can	5	2
on the full amount for the next three months.	5	2
Couldn't you spare that interest in exchange for my peace of mind?	5	2
Lane, darling?	5	2
What? I'm sorry. I didn't get that last bit.	5	2
Nothing.	5	2
Don't forget to get the name of Megan's real estate agent.	5	2
Yes, dear.	5	2
And her decorator.	5	2
[GAIL LAUGHING]	5	2
Apolo, you're so good with him.	5	2
I wasn't expecting you back so soon.	5	2
First in line at the post office. It wasn't that bad.	5	2
Hello, Miss Joan.	5	2
Sink is draining.	5	2
Turns out it was a lemon peel.	5	2
I'm sure you know we're appreciative, but Mother and I have so much to do.	5	2
I am busy, busy, too.	5	2
You don't have to rush off.	5	2
He doesn't have to rush off, does he?	5	2
When you need Apolo, you call Apolo.	5	2
[CHUCKLES]	5	2
APOLO: Miss Joan.	5	2
[TOOLBOX CLATTERS]	5	2
I want him to hear. That was just rude.	5	2
It is one thing to have him work here,	5	2
it is another thing to give him cake and my baby.	5	2
His fingers have been in every toilet from here to the Bowery.	5	2
He brought the cookies.	5	2
If you want to go on a date with him, just ask.	5	2
He's married with four children.	5	2
I'm just making sure this apartment gets his attention.	5	2
This apartment has never had any trouble getting his attention.	5	2
Yes, Joanie. Everyone's staring at you.	5	2
You know you're not exactly at your fighting weight.	5	2
Try me.	5	2
You asked me to come out here.	5	2
You can go home any time you want.	5	2
You should think before you say that.	5	2
I got my money's worth.	5	2
Well, I wasn't going to show you this.	5	2
That doesn't make any sense.	5	2
Look, I'm sure it's not the way anyone wants you to find out.	5	2
No, it's not in the want ads.	5	2
And, honestly, they don't have the money for more people.	5	2
It's not more people. It's you.	5	2
You love stirring the shit.	5	2
I am telling you something you don't want to hear,	5	2
and you are making this very painful for me.	5	2
Megan Draper just invited me to her party.	5	2
At the very last minute. Don't tell me that girl's not conniving.	5	2
You think she wants you around her husband?	5	2
I'm going to lie down.	5	2
Sometimes life makes decisions for you.	5	2
- Have a good day. - Okay.	5	2
Bonjour!	5	2
I know your birthday was last week,	5	2
and I was told you don't celebrate it and not to bring it up.	5	2
Now I feel like I got caught with my pants down,	5	2
so I got you a little something.	5	2
It's a plant.	5	2
I just wanted to say happy birthday.	5	2
Kiss-ass.	5	2
Thank you.	5	2
[SINGING IN FRENCH]	5	2
I can get you some coffee, but there's a partners' meeting.	5	2
- Nobody's there. - It's in Mr. Campbell's office.	5	2
- You want to smile? - Is it your obituary?	5	2
No, it's the little salt we rubbed in Y&R's wound.	5	2
[IN FRENCH ACCENT] It's beautiful, no?	5	2
- That's Mr. Campbell. - Shall we?	5	2
[PHONE RINGING]	5	2
What?	5	2
We don't make fun of each other's wives here. Understood?	5	2
[CHUCKLES] Come on, I wasn't making fun of her. I was making fun of you.	5	2
- You're happy. - I am.	5	2
Well, I want you to be happy.	5	2
Somebody should be.	5	2
You know, two weeks ago,	5	2
"Jane asked me, ""Which one's Mussolini?"""	5	2
[BOTH LAUGHING]	5	2
No, it's good. She's a great girl.	5	2
They're all great girls. At least until they want something.	5	2
Let's go.	5	2
They're just leaving now.	5	2
What, did they stop for a drink?	5	2
Well, why don't you get off your rear, find them, and tell them I'm about...	5	2
They're here.	5	2
Gentlemen, if you could slide over a bit.	5	2
- A marvelous fete. - Oh, yes.	5	2
I have instructions from Trudy to thank both of you.	5	2
- Why are we meeting in here? - Why are we here?	5	2
Please, don't smoke in here. I spent the morning choking on the train.	5	2
So, Mohawk is coming in. I've brought them in.	5	2
- What do you know about that? - That's great news.	5	2
- When? - I don't know.	5	2
All I was thinking is that I bring Henry and Jack in here	5	2
to this very gathering of individuals, but I have one question.	5	2
Where are they going to sit?	5	2
I mean, what kind of impression does this space give you?	5	2
Do you gaze upon the cement column and think,	5	2
"""Yes, I believe success for me and my company dwells here."""	5	2
[LAUGHING]	5	2
Why don't you take them to the conference room?	5	2
Because it's not that meeting.	5	2
Fine, we'll have it in my office.	5	2
This does not involve you, Roger.	5	2
Nor does Vicks, Playtex, Life cereal, Samsonite,	5	2
Sugarberry Ham, Secor Laxative.	5	2
Need I go on?	5	2
What are you suggesting?	5	2
He's suggesting that you give him your office.	5	2
- [CHUCKLES] No, he's not. - Yes, I am.	5	2
Well, forget it.	5	2
Where am I supposed to conduct business?	5	2
In the crapper, for all I care.	5	2
I'm a full partner and you're a junior, so sorry, Charlie, but them's the breaks.	5	2
Gentlemen, I'm sure we can find an equitable solution to this.	5	2
- There's no need for a row. - You're right.	5	2
I say we put it to a vote.	5	2
I say we step outside.	5	2
I didn't think so.	5	2
Good work on Mohawk.	5	2
Thank you, but I'm dead serious about this.	5	2
I have too much responsibility and too much business	5	2
to apply my skills in this environment.	5	2
You all know it.	5	2
We'll buy more space.	5	2
- If we're handing out offices... - Absolutely not.	5	2
I can't extend our credit line any further.	5	2
It'll work itself out.	5	2
Congratulations.	5	2
When are they coming in?	5	2
I'm still not sure they should, considering the situation.	5	2
Great party, Don.	5	2
Absolutely.	5	2
I couldn't sleep.	5	2
Those tits and that mouth.	5	2
She's such a sex kitten.	5	2
That whole dance. How did he just sit there?	5	2
You can't stand up once you get in that condition.	5	2
I would have. I would have just stood up and grabbed her little French behind	5	2
and pushed her through those cheap post-war walls.	5	2
- Hi, Megan. - Very funny.	5	2
God, what I would do to her.	5	2
Like what, for example?	5	2
I'll tell you what.	5	2
I would love to see those heels on my shoulder.	5	2
"""Je voudrais mas Harry."""	5	2
Good morning.	5	2
Great party.	5	2
Thrilled to be included. Jennifer was very jealous.	5	2
[LAUGHING]	5	2
I think I'm gonna die.	5	2
Oh!	5	2
You could have warned me.	5	2
I did. [LAUGHS]	5	2
[INTERCOM BUZZES]	5	2
SCARLETT: I have the owner of the wallet returning your call.	5	2
Thank you.	5	2
- Hello. - WOMAN: Hello, Mr. Pryce.	5	2
I'm calling for Alex Polito.	5	2
- And who is this? - This is his girl, Delores.	5	2
Oh.	5	2
Well, when he comes into the office,	5	2
I think I should speak with him personally.	5	2
I'm not his secretary. I'm his girl.	5	2
I'm like his wife, but I can't call myself that.	5	2
Oh.	5	2
You don't sound happy about that.	5	2
- Excuse me? - I'm married myself.	5	2
Good for you. What's her name?	5	2
Rebecca. Rebecca Pryce. Well, obviously.	5	2
- That's a pretty name. - I suppose so.	5	2
She enjoys it.	5	2
Do you think she's home right now, lying in bed, talking to a stranger?	5	2
Uh, oh...	5	2
I should hope not.	5	2
So, you have Alex's wallet?	5	2
Yes, I do.	5	2
- And where are you? - I'm at my offices in Midtown.	5	2
Oh! Are you in big business?	5	2
Excuse me?	5	2
Are you in a big office building?	5	2
[STUTTERS]	5	2
Yes.	5	2
That's why I don't have the luxury of lying around at 11:00 in my underthings.	5	2
[CHUCKLES] I didn't tell you that part.	5	2
You didn't say I was incorrect, either.	5	2
Where the hell are you from?	5	2
You sound like Cary Grant.	5	2
I told you, Midtown.	5	2
Why don't I...	5	2
Listen, I really should return this, you know, the wallet.	5	2
I could slip it in the post or...	5	2
Of course, you know, that has its disadvantages.	5	2
There's a bit of cash here.	5	2
Or I could hand-deliver it.	5	2
Is this a current address?	5	2
I don't know.	5	2
I don't know if that would be proper.	5	2
No, of course.	5	2
Why don't you meet me at my place of business?	5	2
I'll give you the address or have my secretary help you.	5	2
Yeah. Why don't we do that?	5	2
And I'll come by when I can.	5	2
Well, I'll be here the rest of my life.	5	2
[CHUCKLES]	5	2
Just a minute.	5	2
I look forward to it.	5	2
Why not?	5	2
Toodle-oo.	5	2
That's cute.	5	2
[CHUCKLES]	5	2
Scarlett, would you give this woman directions to our office?	5	2
She's on line three.	5	2
[INTERCOM BUZZES]	5	2
SECRETARY: Mr. Crane, Mr. Sterling has requested you in his office.	5	2
Is there a meeting?	5	2
[WHISPERING] He just came over here, said he needed to see you, and walked away.	5	2
- Why didn't he come in? - I don't know.	5	2
He knows you're in there.	5	2
Okay. Okay. Did you see him talking to Megan or Don?	5	2
I've been working.	5	2
- What did you do? - Nothing!	5	2
You wanted to see me?	5	2
I did. [COUGHS] Come in, have a seat.	5	2
No, that's okay.	5	2
I think you should have a seat.	5	2
Okay.	5	2
Now,	5	2
I think you know that we like to think of this place as a family.	5	2
And there are certain ways a family behaves.	5	2
What did she say? You have to hear my side of it.	5	2
Your side of what?	5	2
What... Nothing.	5	2
You're always up to something, aren't you, Crane?	5	2
It was an honest mistake and I consider myself reprimanded.	5	2
Great.	5	2
I was thinking Pete could take your office.	5	2
Really?	5	2
Look, I will apologize face to face,	5	2
as horrible as that will be, but I think you're...	5	2
There's no reason to let me go.	5	2
You're not getting fired.	5	2
Oh.	5	2
And what the hell did you do?	5	2
I made fun of Zou Bisou.	5	2
So did I.	5	2
[LAUGHS]	5	2
Is that a crime? No.	5	2
I tried to get Jane to talk to me in that accent. Nothing doing.	5	2
She doesn't speak French. She doesn't like me.	5	2
I went home after and Jennifer didn't know what was coming.	5	2
- I was like... - I don't want to hear that.	5	2
No, of course you don't. Why would you?	5	2
Look, I think you can understand that Pete needs a bigger office.	5	2
And just between you, me, and the window washer,	5	2
it's been decided that you should trade.	5	2
- Who decided that? - I did.	5	2
I can't do that. And I don't know that I have to do it.	5	2
Do I?	5	2
[SIGHS]	5	2
Harry.	5	2
I'm asking you as a friend.	5	2
And I appreciate that, Roger, I really do, but I need my office.	5	2
Look, first of all, Pete's office isn't that different.	5	2
- I disagree. - Fine.	5	2
Name the most important person you could bring into this office.	5	2
William Paley.	5	2
Okay, so you shouldn't do that.	5	2
Trust me, network and studio executives want to think you're out there jet-setting,	5	2
rubbing shoulders with television stars and chorus girls.	5	2
You should be talking to clients ringside	5	2
or at a three-star restaurant, not coming into your miserable little office.	5	2
But I do. I come in here almost every day.	5	2
And Pete's office is a shithole with a support beam.	5	2
What if I were to make it worth your while?	5	2
I'm already head of my department.	5	2
What would be an appropriate bonus?	5	2
There's no bonuses. We have no money.	5	2
How much would it take?	5	2
Well, first of all, it's more than you could have on you.	5	2
Really?	5	2
That's $1,100.	5	2
Why do you carry so much cash?	5	2
It's more than $1,000, Harry.	5	2
That is a month's salary after taxes.	5	2
There's no window in there.	5	2
You could buy yourself a very beautiful picture of something to look at.	5	2
Well, okay. But you're gonna owe me.	5	2
No, I'm not. I just gave you a lot of money.	5	2
This is a transaction. And if you don't like it,	5	2
we can have the conversation you thought we were having.	5	2
- So this is every month? - Get the hell out of my office.	5	2
Excuse me. I'm sorry.	5	2
I'm Joan.	5	2
I'm Meredith. Can I help you?	5	2
Joan Harris.	5	2
I work here.	5	2
Worked here. I've been on leave.	5	2
Oh!	5	2
Joan. My goodness.	5	2
It's hard to believe you just had a baby.	5	2
You don't know where I started.	5	2
Do you want me to announce you?	5	2
No, I'll let myself in.	5	2
Are you sure?	5	2
No one mentioned a new girl.	5	2
I guess they needed someone up here because Scarlett is now covering Mr. Pryce	5	2
so that she can do the books with Clara.	5	2
Well, now I can understand why I wasn't told.	5	2
Oh, my God. My mouth.	5	2
Could you just help me with the door?	5	2
Oh.	5	2
He's adorable.	5	2
Please don't be mad at me for telling you that.	5	2
I'm very happy being nobody here.	5	2
I know a girl who had your job who ended up with everything.	5	2
Where would you like to visit first?	5	2
I suppose my office.	5	2
Yes, yes, absolutely. Joan.	5	2
My goodness, you look radiant.	5	2
- Can I see him? - I don't see why not.	5	2
- Where's Scarlett? - Go fetch Caroline.	5	2
Joanie.	5	2
Look at you out and about.	5	2
Yes, we're gonna stop by The Copa later.	5	2
One of us badly needs a drink.	5	2
Lane made it very clear we're not hiring anybody.	5	2
I don't care how buxom his mother is.	5	2
Oh, Don.	5	2
- Look at that. - He's okay.	5	2
Hello, Megan.	5	2
Oh!	5	2
Hello, Joan.	5	2
I'm sure I'm not ruining any surprises at this point,	5	2
but how was your party? I'm sorry I missed it.	5	2
Oh, he's adorable.	5	2
Are we welcoming you back?	5	2
- That was my impression. - Today?	5	2
- Do you want to hold him? - What?	5	2
He's a little cabbage.	5	2
Mon petit chou.	5	2
It's just a matter of time, Don.	5	2
I should be getting back to work. [CHUCKLES]	5	2
[KEVIN COOS]	5	2
- I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead. - [CHUCKLES]	5	2
Joanie, I'll say what I said when you left here,	5	2
this is not a good excuse.	5	2
Nice to see you.	5	2
- When are you coming back? - I was planning on three weeks.	5	2
My mother's leaving any day, so I was gonna hire a girl.	5	2
It's gonna be terrible to leave him.	5	2
Joan.	5	2
I was wondering if you were going to visit.	5	2
My hands are dirty.	5	2
Oh, my God. He looks just like you.	5	2
I should get back to work. I have more than ever, thanks to you, Joan.	5	2
Good.	5	2
So, how are you?	5	2
ROGER: Well, well, well.	5	2
There's my baby.	5	2
Now move that brat out of the way so I can see her.	5	2
Hello, Roger.	5	2
Little dud like my present?	5	2
I'm sure you're aware that a bicycle's not useful yet, Uncle Roger.	5	2
Oh, no? He's a loafer?	5	2
He's been keeping me awake. He needs constant attention.	5	2
Is that right? Let me see that.	5	2
Has anyone even seen this baby with you walking next to him?	5	2
[INTERCOM BUZZES]	5	2
LANE: Scarlett. Scarlett, may I see you?	5	2
I got it.	5	2
[HIGH VOICE] Mr. Pryce, Mrs. Harris is here to see you.	5	2
[LANE STUTTERS]	5	2
- Send her in. - I've got him.	5	2
Caroline, I need you to make dinner reservations right away.	5	2
I'll be right back.	5	2
This really is an unexpected pleasure.	5	2
Just stopping by.	5	2
Anything I should know about?	5	2
Yes, actually. Pressing business.	5	2
Would you mind?	5	2
No, not at all.	5	2
What are we supposed to do with him?	5	2
Better than the steps of a church, I guess.	5	2
Have either of you seen Clara?	5	2
No.	5	2
What's that?	5	2
It's Joan's little boy.	5	2
Oh.	5	2
That's darling.	5	2
Would you please take him and give him back to Joan?	5	2
Do I suddenly appear to be wearing a skirt?	5	2
Spectacular party.	5	2
Just take him. You should say hello to Joan anyways.	5	2
Clara?	5	2
She looks very good.	5	2
She does. She looked good at nine months.	5	2
I don't know about that.	5	2
I'm surprised you didn't tell her.	5	2
- Tell her what? - That she looked terrible.	5	2
You seem to say whatever's on your mind.	5	2
Is something wrong?	5	2
No.	5	2
I got the Vicks coupons done.	5	2
I know you thought you were the only one working this weekend.	5	2
No, I didn't.	5	2
Really? That's what you said to Don.	5	2
I know. I had too much to drink and...	5	2
And you couldn't resist saying something obnoxious?	5	2
Well, just so we're clear, I put in a lot of work on Heinz. So did you.	5	2
You can't even apologize. None of you can.	5	2
- I'm sorry. - You're sorry?	5	2
What is wrong with you people?	5	2
You're all so cynical. You don't smile. You smirk.	5	2
Is he mad at me?	5	2
I don't care.	5	2
Who wouldn't want a surprise party?	5	2
I don't feel well.	5	2
Megan...	5	2
No, really, I don't feel well.	5	2
Am I allowed to go home?	5	2
Of course.	5	2
I'm so sorry. You were right.	5	2
I apologize.	5	2
It's fine.	5	2
LANE: Heinz won't sign off on the work.	5	2
So they won't be back in for 30 days,	5	2
which means we won't get paid for another 90.	5	2
And we're about to shoot Christmas ads for Sugarberry and Vicks.	5	2
But they won't run until Christmas,	5	2
so we won't get paid until Easter.	5	2
Well, that explains why you're asking me for all this free advice.	5	2
I'm just trying to get things in order.	5	2
So that you can eliminate my job?	5	2
What? Absolutely not.	5	2
- Then why did you run an ad? - What ad?	5	2
- In this morning's Times. - Oh, that.	5	2
That wasn't an ad.	5	2
Well, what the hell was it, then?	5	2
It was some private barb directed at Y&R.	5	2
Mrs. Harris, the books have practically been held together	5	2
with spit in your absence.	5	2
[VOICE 	5	2
ING] What about Scarlett and Clara splitting my work?	5	2
Splitting?	5	2
The two of them together couldn't operate a parking meter. They're imbeciles.	5	2
Well, that was a dumb thing to do.	5	2
Oh, there, there.	5	2
I'm sorry.	5	2
[SNIFFLING]	5	2
I've been like this since the baby.	5	2
And it's not him.	5	2
I just	5	2
keep thinking about what's going on here, and I missed it too much.	5	2
It's too embarrassing.	5	2
Nothing's happened.	5	2
Something always happens. Things are different.	5	2
Somebody tells a joke and you don't know what they're talking about.	5	2
There have been no jokes, not without you.	5	2
Not even at my expense?	5	2
I'm terribly adrift without you.	5	2
It's just a matter of time before they find out I'm a sham.	5	2
Nobody came to visit me.	5	2
They sent flowers with some stupid card written by the florist.	5	2
There would have been a cake, but you weren't here to arrange it.	5	2
[LAUGHS]	5	2
It's just...	5	2
And I don't expect you to understand this,	5	2
but my husband's been gone so long.	5	2
And I know he's coming home soon.	5	2
And even with my baby there and my mother,	5	2
I feel alone.	5	2
It's home, but it's not everything.	5	2
I do understand.	5	2
Now, I won't have everyone thinking I've made you cry.	5	2
[CHUCKLES]	5	2
Well, at least tell me about the party.	5	2
Mrs. Draper put on a bit of a burlesque.	5	2
- No. - Oh, yes.	5	2
She danced and sang in front of all of us.	5	2
She was quite the coquette.	5	2
[LAUGHS]	5	2
I can't do it justice.	5	2
And Don?	5	2
I saw his soul leave his body.	5	2
I can't even imagine how handsome that man must be blushing.	5	2
Yes.	5	2
[KNOCK AT DOOR]	5	2
I don't know how I ended up with him, but...	5	2
Thank you so much.	5	2
Mr. Pryce, I will be speaking with you.	5	2
Let me take a look at him at least.	5	2
Handsome little blagger.	5	2
[	5	2
S WIND]	5	2
Ah.	5	2
[EXCLAIMS]	5	2
- Oops! - [LAUGHS]	5	2
Have you seen Clara?	5	2
CLARA: Congratulations. We're gonna be right next to each other finally.	5	2
What's going on?	5	2
Clara, could you excuse us?	5	2
Well, she obviously already knows.	5	2
Please.	5	2
Roger, you know, convinced me.	5	2
We all thought it was best for the firm that you have a bigger office,	5	2
so I was asked to switch.	5	2
I'll be right back.	5	2
I appreciate your sacrifice, but a bigger office was not the point.	5	2
Well, fine, then. I'll switch back.	5	2
Roger didn't say I couldn't switch back.	5	2
I don't care what Roger says. I am the head of accounts.	5	2
I am bringing in all the business. I deserve the bigger office.	5	2
It's a great office, Pete.	5	2
It's very important.	5	2
It's got the windows. God, I'm gonna miss them.	5	2
And you did this because Roger told you to?	5	2
And also because I respect you so much.	5	2
What do you want me to say?	5	2
Look, I just need a place to hide until Megan leaves.	5	2
Oh, God, unless she told Don.	5	2
She's not gonna tell Don, is she?	5	2
I don't know what you're talking about.	5	2
[KNOCK AT DOOR]	5	2
Come in.	5	2
What's up?	5	2
At your party, which was lovely,	5	2
I said something which I shouldn't have said,	5	2
and I want to apologize if you had a bad time because of it.	5	2
I had a wonderful time.	5	2
Well, good.	5	2
The only reason I'm bringing it up is Megan seemed kind of upset.	5	2
I'm very sorry.	5	2
I should not be allowed to drink at work functions.	5	2
Or at all, honestly.	5	2
- What did she say? - Nothing.	5	2
But she went home. She wasn't feeling well.	5	2
I'm mortified if I had something to do with it.	5	2
When did she leave?	5	2
I think she wants to be alone.	5	2
You don't know her at all.	5	2
Caroline.	5	2
I'm done for the day.	5	2
[INTERCOM BUZZES]	5	2
SCARLETT: Mr. Pryce.	5	2
Yes, Scarlett?	5	2
There's a gentleman here, the owner of the wallet, Mr. Polito.	5	2
He's in reception. Shall I bring him back?	5	2
No, absolutely not.	5	2
Well, do you want to see him?	5	2
Yes, I'll be out in a moment.	5	2
Of course, Mr. Pryce.	5	2
Thank you, Delores.	5	2
- Excuse me? - I said... Just a minute.	5	2
Hello.	5	2
Are you Mr. Polito?	5	2
I am. Although there's no way for you to know that.	5	2
You got my wallet.	5	2
I contacted you.	5	2
Thank you.	5	2
Well, I'm glad this worked out.	5	2
Hold on.	5	2
Just hold on a second.	5	2
Everything's there.	5	2
So it is.	5	2
Well, you can't blame me.	5	2
My horse came in and then I lost my wallet.	5	2
Then it came in again. [CHUCKLES]	5	2
No, that's not necessary.	5	2
- You've got to take a reward. - I couldn't possibly.	5	2
My girl said you were real polite.	5	2
Obviously from the accent, you're not from around here.	5	2
No, I'm not.	5	2
This is the way we do things.	5	2
Thanks again. I mean it.	5	2
You're a real gentleman.	5	2
Megan? Where are you?	5	2
Oh. You're home.	5	2
So are you. What happened?	5	2
Nothing.	5	2
You just left without me?	5	2
- I was upset. - That's clear.	5	2
About what?	5	2
Because my apartment is filthy.	5	2
Where's the girl?	5	2
I sent her home.	5	2
What are you doing?	5	2
I'm cleaning up. I don't want to get sweaty.	5	2
- Like that? - Don't you look at me.	5	2
I'm talking to you.	5	2
I'm cleaning up.	5	2
Really?	5	2
Stop looking at me. You aren't allowed to look at me.	5	2
Then put some clothes on.	5	2
I said stop it. You don't deserve it.	5	2
Come on.	5	2
You don't like presents. You don't like nice things.	5	2
Besides, you're too old.	5	2
I don't need an old person.	5	2
You probably couldn't do it anyway.	5	2
Don't!	5	2
- Get up. - No.	5	2
I don't want people to think you're getting this.	5	2
You want it so badly.	5	2
I don't want it. I don't want you.	5	2
You don't get to have this. Go sit over there.	5	2
All you get to do is watch.	5	2
[GROANS]	5	2
Where's Harry?	5	2
Who cares?	5	2
I'm sorry. Do you need to see Mr. Campbell?	5	2
No.	5	2
Is Roger Sterling still here?	5	2
Yes.	5	2
I want you to let him do whatever he wants.	5	2
And I want you to pencil in an appointment tomorrow	5	2
at the coffee shop in the ferry building in Staten Island.	5	2
6:00 am.	5	2
With Coca-Cola.	5	2
Okay.	5	2
That'll be all.	5	2
I don't think those people like me.	5	2
That's not true.	5	2
Well, I'm not sure I like them.	5	2
[SIGHS]	5	2
The reason I didn't want you to have that party is	5	2
I didn't want them in our home.	5	2
You've only been in the creative end of this business for three months.	5	2
And being a secretary, you don't know what goes on.	5	2
There isn't one problem that Peggy or anybody in that office has	5	2
that wasn't there before you.	5	2
You think you're a splinter?	5	2
You're not.	5	2
The whole foot's been infected for years.	5	2
I love going to work with you because	5	2
you love work and you love me.	5	2
But I wonder if maybe it's not a good idea.	5	2
I don't really care about work.	5	2
I want you at work	5	2
because I want you.	5	2
I think we have to replace the rug.	5	2
Just because you see white carpet in a magazine doesn't mean it's practical.	5	2
It's beautiful.	5	2
Well, I've taken a lot of pictures of white carpets.	5	2
You have to have four or five on hand.	5	2
I thought you wanted it.	5	2
I just wanted you to have what you want.	5	2
What are you doing?	5	2
I've got to go to Staten Island.	5	2
- What time is it? - Shut up.	5	2
An above-ground pool?	5	2
No, no, in the ground. With deck chairs.	5	2
That costs a fortune. You gonna dig it yourself?	5	2
We'll see what happens at Christmas.	5	2
I never count on a bonus.	5	2
I'm not talking to you.	5	2
I hope to be dead by Christmas.	5	2
[ALL LAUGHING]	5	2
Do you have any money for the grocer?	5	2
You told me not to write any checks.	5	2
No, of course.	5	2
[HUSHING]	5	2
Ssh!	5	2
He's finally gone to sleep.	5	2
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]	5	2
[ALL TALKING SOFTLY]	5	2
We cannot call security. They are applicants.	5	2
What's going on out there?	5	2
They're all here responding to your hilarious advertisement.	5	2
Oh.	5	2
Is it just me, or is the lobby full of negroes?	5	2
They saw the Y&R ad.	5	2
The humor was lost on them.	5	2
- Not on me. - It was a childish prank.	5	2
Because you're above that, right?	5	2
What are we gonna do?	5	2
Would you leave us be, dear?	5	2
Tell them the position's been filled.	5	2
There's the possibility that we could be the subject of a protest.	5	2
Then we interview them. Forever. They'll go away.	5	2
That is not a solution.	5	2
And who's to say there's not a reporter out there?	5	2
I don't know why we can't just hire one.	5	2
Because we're not hiring anyone.	5	2
Just fire that receptionist.	5	2
We can't have one out there.	5	2
- What is that? - It's from Young & Rubicam.	5	2
It's a resume.	5	2
"""1960 to '65,"""	5	2
"""toted dat barge, lifted dat bale."""	5	2
[CHUCKLES]	5	2
Did those people out there	5	2
see that artifact come in here?	5	2
Yes. I'm positive.	5	2
Good morning.	5	2
I'd like to thank you all for coming.	5	2
First of all, we're only looking for secretaries.	5	2
So, gentlemen, you are free to leave.	5	2
I mean, you are welcome to leave.	5	2
I mean, you may go.	5	2
[CLEARS THROAT]	5	2
I will be collecting resumes,	5	2
and then those of you who meet the qualifications	5	2
will receive a call to schedule an interview.	5	2

Betty, are you ready?	5	3
It's stuck.	5	3
What about now?	5	3
Betty!	5	3
I'll get it. Just go.	5	3
Betty? The car is here.	5	3
What's going on? We've got to go.	5	3
Darling, I just don't think I can go tonight.	5	3
What's the matter?	5	3
It's a woman's thing.	5	3
Is there any way you could play with pain?	5	3
 It's the Junior League of New York. I don't want to do it without you.	5	3
Your mother will be there. It'll be very endearing.	5	3
Forgive me on the way?	5	3
Thank you.	5	3
Say au revoir.	5	3
Bonjour, Marie.	5	3
Marie, I can't understand you.	5	3
- Moustiques? - Mosquitoes.	5	3
We can't let Heinz beat us there.	5	3
He has a name, you know.	5	3
And do you know what that is?	5	3
Are you kidding me?	5	3
He's the only man I want to please more than you.	5	3
And your father.	5	3
 I'm the baby. They miss me.	5	3
So, Megan, you're French. I suppose I should ask you what looks good.	5	3
I'm Canadian. Although, for all we know, they are, too.	5	3
You know, back in Pittsburgh,	5	3
everybody is pretty much who you expect them to be.	5	3
Or you know them forever.	5	3
Raymond and I met in high school.	5	3
Well, then we've been married longer than you.	5	3
- I told you he was smooth. - How did you two meet?	5	3
- Well... - At work.	5	3
Don was divorced.	5	3
Well, that's none of my business.	5	3
You have a teenage daughter, Emily.	5	3
- How's her summer? - It's tough.	5	3
She's around the house all the time.	5	3
Too old for camp, too young for a job.	5	3
- I say let her enjoy it. - I agree.	5	3
You don't sound so happy about it when I get home.	5	3
Well, the music is so loud.	5	3
Do you know the Rolling Stones, Don?	5	3
- Sure. - The Stones.	5	3
She can't get enough of them.	5	3
"The other night, she's playing this song, ""Time, time is on your side..."""	5	3
- Time Is On My Side. - Yes, it is, dear.	5	3
Well, it's catchy. And I was thinking, what if they were to sing, you know,	5	3
"""Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side""?"	5	3
Or something like that. I don't know.	5	3
They're gonna be in New York.	5	3
Emily almost jumped in our bags with us when she heard we were coming.	5	3
Maybe you could, you know, get them to record it while they're here.	5	3
Well, that's not exactly the way it works, but we can certainly approach them.	5	3
This is boring. Am I right, Megan?	5	3
Yes.	5	3
Clara, where is Roger?	5	3
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.	5	3
- You wanted to see me? - I was waiting in my office	5	3
to give you some good news.	5	3
Drinking good news?	5	3
Mohawk called.	5	3
You're welcome.	5	3
They haven't informed their agency, but I'm told it's a matter of hours.	5	3
Welcome back, suckers.	5	3
I think you should handle the account.	5	3
- So, they asked for me. - They enjoy your company.	5	3
And since you were here when they were here, they think you know their business.	5	3
I know Hank from the war. He likes vodka.	5	3
Jack likes Jack. Anything else?	5	3
So you're aware they've taken on $54 million in debt to replace their planes	5	3
and there's a mechanic strike looming?	5	3
- Although they'll likely be spared. - So far, so good.	5	3
Don and I have been trying to explain to Lane	5	3
this is a daily business and we'll need a dedicated copywriter.	5	3
I don't understand why Miss Olson can't handle it.	5	3
Because these guys are gonna ask her to make drinks.	5	3
We're still paying Don, aren't we?	5	3
Don's not going to write local fare ads three times a week.	5	3
That's all it is?	5	3
Just get a guy with basic retail experience and run with it.	5	3
Congratulations.	5	3
Lane, smile. We've got an airline.	5	3
Morning. I'm here to see Don.	5	3
Yes, just a minute. Mr. Draper, Mr. Crane to see you.	5	3
Just a minute, Dawn.	5	3
Is Don in a meeting?	5	3
He's with Mrs. Draper.	5	3
Thank you, Dawn.	5	3
You're welcome.	5	3
It's so confusing.	5	3
People keep saying that, but we haven't had any problems.	5	3
You haven't. But out in the office, it's really hard to tell who's who.	5	3
- Hello, Harry. - Good morning.	5	3
Backstage, Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, Saturday night,	5	3
put your hands together for the Rolling Stones.	5	3
And how would you gauge their interest?	5	3
The manager sounded greedy. I thought we'd take one car.	5	3
- I'll drive. - It starts at 8:00,	5	3
but apparently they're always late. I thought we could grab a bite.	5	3
There's a dynamite Italian restaurant with a first-rate veal parm.	5	3
- Nope. - Good.	5	3
Then I will be ready at 7:30, having eaten.	5	3
Have Dawn pencil it in.	5	3
- Hello, Pauline. - Hello, dear.	5	3
I just wanted to see how you were feeling.	5	3
Aren't you sweet to come all the way over here	5	3
when a phone call would have sufficed.	5	3
Are the children home?	5	3
They're at day camp. You know that.	5	3
Betty, you were sorely missed last night.	5	3
Well, that's good to hear, I guess.	5	3
You've missed a bunch of these, Betty.	5	3
- Pauline... - And I'm sure he never shows it,	5	3
but it upsets Henry when you're not there.	5	3
I want him to be happy. And you being with him is part of that.	5	3
I wasn't feeling well.	5	3
Honey, I know how it happens.	5	3
You get comfortable, and you give up a little bit,	5	3
and then it just gets out of control.	5	3
There are things you can do about this.	5	3
There are pills you can take.	5	3
Why haven't you taken them?	5	3
Believe me, I would if I could.	5	3
I have a heart condition.	5	3
And honestly, at my age, I don't have to please men anymore.	5	3
But you...	5	3
Don't you want to get back into that incredible closet of yours again?	5	3
It'll be easy for you.	5	3
You're just one of those girls.	5	3
Thank you, Dawn.	5	3
- What's so funny? - She was the most qualified.	5	3
We've got great news, but assume this is for your ample ears only.	5	3
Is it about Heinz and the Rolling Stones?	5	3
- What? - No.	5	3
Harry's such a liar.	5	3
Baked beans and the Rolling Stones.	5	3
A client's idea if I ever heard one.	5	3
Mohawk Airlines is returning.	5	3
That's great. That's a big fish.	5	3
It's a minnow, but it's our minnow.	5	3
Well, I obviously have experience, I mean, at a low level,	5	3
but I saw how it worked.	5	3
Your plate is full,	5	3
and, frankly, Mohawk is going to insist on a regular copywriter.	5	3
- Someone with a penis. - I'll work on that.	5	3
Call in books. You're the search committee.	5	3
- Okay, when? - Immediately.	5	3
Now, this is gonna be my account,	5	3
so I don't want just some hack with retail experience.	5	3
He should be brilliant and have awards.	5	3
I want you to bring me a good-looking version of Don.	5	3
That'll be easy.	5	3
- Mrs. Francis. - Hello.	5	3
So nice of you to see me so quickly.	5	3
Well, slow day.	5	3
What seems to be the problem?	5	3
Well, it's just that I've been wondering...	5	3
I've put on a few pounds	5	3
and I haven't had much luck reducing on my own for some reason.	5	3
Well, with middle-aged women, it gets easier to put it on and harder to take it off.	5	3
Well,	5	3
a friend told me it'd be easier if you gave me diet pills.	5	3
Just to give me a little jump-start.	5	3
Is your friend a doctor?	5	3
No.	5	3
Well, I'm not going to give you a prescription without giving you an exam.	5	3
What, for diet pills?	5	3
If you think it's necessary.	5	3
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife has a rapid weight gain,	5	3
the cause is usually psychological.	5	3
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom, things that cause us to lose our self-control.	5	3
But first,	5	3
we have to rule out diabetes, hyperthyroidism...	5	3
I don't need to take the pills forever.	5	3
I don't like that.	5	3
What?	5	3
Could you swallow?	5	3
Henry!	5	3
Mrs. Francis is on line one.	5	3
- Betts, you there? - Don.	5	3
- I don't know what to do. - About what?	5	3
I went to the doctor this morning and he found this thing.	5	3
It's a node or a nodule	5	3
or something, and it's on my thyroid.	5	3
And they don't know what it is, but it's a lump, Don.	5	3
And he's sending me to the city to some specialist for tests.	5	3
Okay, okay, calm down.	5	3
I can't, Don. I can't.	5	3
Betts, what exactly did he say?	5	3
Nothing. You know how they are.	5	3
Do you want me to take the kids?	5	3
The kids.	5	3
The kids. Oh, God.	5	3
Birdie.	5	3
Say what you always say.	5	3
Everything's gonna be okay.	5	3
Okay.	5	3
Bye-bye.	5	3
If I see one more Volkswagen ad with something else in it...	5	3
You can do an ad on anything you want. Don't pick toilet paper, shitbird.	5	3
Too fat.	5	3
Too thin.	5	3
Shelly Parker. Might be a woman, God forbid.	5	3
Irony. That's promising.	5	3
Have I lost my sense of smell, or is this good?	5	3
That's bitching.	5	3
What's this guy's name?	5	3
"""Michael Ginsberg."""	5	3
Nice knowing you, Mike.	5	3
What are you doing? That's the best one I've seen.	5	3
This is why girls don't play sports.	5	3
You've been working on Heinz for four months.	5	3
Somebody else is gonna carry the ball across the goal line?	5	3
Bringing him in for Mohawk.	5	3
I hope you like him. He's gonna be your boss someday.	5	3
I like working with talented people. It inspires me.	5	3
I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about another writer.	5	3
Are you suddenly not competitive?	5	3
The chick who races people to the toilet?	5	3
I'm going to bring him in.	5	3
Stick to mediocre. You'll sleep better.	5	3
Can I come in?	5	3
Of course.	5	3
I just got off the phone with Jim. He said tomorrow at 11:00.	5	3
Tomorrow?	5	3
My boss made a call.	5	3
You told Mayor Lindsay?	5	3
He's got bigger secrets than this, Betty.	5	3
- I don't know if tomorrow... - You want to wait on this?	5	3
- Well, if it is something... - If, if, if.	5	3
Betty, let's not play that game, okay?	5	3
Come to bed.	5	3
You want some brandy?	5	3
I see you all the time. You're beautiful.	5	3
You're sweet.	5	3
I'm gonna have a brandy.	5	3
Betty.	5	3
Betty Draper. I almost didn't recognize you.	5	3
Joyce, hello. How are you?	5	3
Not good. I'm here.	5	3
Mrs. Francis, the doctor's waiting.	5	3
It's Francis now.	5	3
My husband's name is Henry, too, actually.	5	3
Look, you know what?	5	3
I'm gonna be in radiology forever.	5	3
Mrs. Darling, they're waiting for you, too.	5	3
Why are you here?	5	3
You want to get some lunch after?	5	3
I don't know. My husband's picking me up.	5	3
You think you don't want to have lunch, but you do.	5	3
Okay.	5	3
Okay, okay. I'm going.	5	3
Hello. I'm Peggy Olson.	5	3
Michael Ginsberg. Lead the way.	5	3
No, we're meeting here.	5	3
So what's he like? Is he like a firm handshake kind of guy?	5	3
- Excuse me? - Don.	5	3
I want to make a good impression. You could help me out.	5	3
No, I'm interviewing you. I'm a copywriter.	5	3
Have a seat.	5	3
So, is Don stopping by?	5	3
No, it's just me.	5	3
- Can you hire me? - Well, no, but I'm the first round.	5	3
Wouldn't you want to talk to the person who could hire you?	5	3
I spent three weeks dancing at that crappy New York satellite of Leo Burnett.	5	3
Never met him at all. Turns out Leo's not a real person.	5	3
- Yes, he is. - Is Don a real person?	5	3
'Cause I'd really like to meet him.	5	3
I'm the person you need to impress right now.	5	3
You looked at my book. What more can I say?	5	3
Okay.	5	3
- I liked your work. - And I like your work.	5	3
You thought I was a secretary. Do you have a current resume?	5	3
- Allen Ginsberg? - He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.	5	3
I figured we got to be related somehow.	5	3
And what's he gonna say?	5	3
Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.	5	3
Nuts. Listen, my stuff is good.	5	3
You can see advertising ain't my day job.	5	3
Look, you're a fair woman.	5	3
I insulted you because I'm honest.	5	3
And I apologized because I'm brave.	5	3
I didn't pick this profession. It picked me. I didn't have any control over it.	5	3
Turns out it's the only thing I can do.	5	3
- Your work's very impressive, but... - Here's some other advantages...	5	3
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.	5	3
I'm one of those people who talks back to the radio.	5	3
No girlfriend, no family. I will live here.	5	3
Then you're like everyone else.	5	3
I've never been accused of that, but I really am trying.	5	3
I don't know.	5	3
You can't act like this with Don.	5	3
Like what?	5	3
- We'll call you. - Okay.	5	3
You know, your book really does have a voice.	5	3
That's what they said about Mein Kampf.	5	3
The kid really has a voice.	5	3
- You're sure you're okay just with tea? - Yes.	5	3
Everything tastes like sawdust to me.	5	3
Everything still tastes good to me.	5	3
Turns out I have the only kind that makes you fatter.	5	3
Look, I'm sure you're fine.	5	3
When do you find out the results?	5	3
I don't remember.	5	3
It wasn't until the third visit that I knew.	5	3
Because Hank was waiting there.	5	3
Have you told your children?	5	3
They know I'm going to the doctor a lot,	5	3
and they know I'm sick, but I've always been in a bad mood, so...	5	3
I joke with Hank. He should just tell them I got hit by a car.	5	3
It'd be easier to deal with than saying goodbye.	5	3
The scene.	5	3
I'm leaving behind such a mess.	5	3
You're not going anywhere.	5	3
He's my second husband.	5	3
His mother's domineering.	5	3
And Don's girlfriend...	5	3
Well, they're married.	5	3
She's 20 years old.	5	3
They'll never hear a nice word about me again.	5	3
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you.	5	3
What is it like?	5	3
Well,	5	3
it's like you're way out in the ocean,	5	3
alone, and you're paddling,	5	3
and you see people on the shore, but they're getting farther and farther away.	5	3
And you struggle because it's natural.	5	3
Then your mind wanders back to everything normal.	5	3
What am I gonna fix for dinner? Did I lock the back door?	5	3
And then you just get so tired,	5	3
you just give in and hope you go straight down.	5	3
That's horrible.	5	3
No one's ever asked.	5	3
Hello, ladies. I am Cecillia, and I have the gift of sight.	5	3
Could I offer you a reading?	5	3
You're gonna predict our future?	5	3
- Go ahead. - Really?	5	3
It's always good.	5	3
- Oh, my. - What?	5	3
You're a great soul.	5	3
You mean so much to the people around you.	5	3
You're a rock.	5	3
I'm sorry.	5	3
We're done. Thank you.	5	3
You need some more tea.	5	3
- Are you okay? - I had drinks with Mohawk.	5	3
I sat down with two of them and I swear by the end there were three.	5	3
Did you hire him?	5	3
No, he was crazy. I'm calling in more books.	5	3
Define crazy for a copywriter.	5	3
Sleeps all day, disrespectful of authority, drunk half the time. Did he smell like pee?	5	3
- Who smells like pee? - Writers. Just hire him.	5	3
I can't. Don will hate him. He's certifiable.	5	3
I order you to bring him in.	5	3
You have to. I already told Mohawk.	5	3
Why would you do that?	5	3
I wanted to smooth the ground about working with a Jew.	5	3
Turns out everybody's got one now.	5	3
Tell you the truth, it makes the agency more modern.	5	3
Between that and it's always darkest before the dawn over there.	5	3
At least this one we're hiring on purpose.	5	3
I can find another Jew, if that's what you care about.	5	3
Look, I know what you're afraid of.	5	3
Sweetheart, no one's gonna replace you.	5	3
I'm not threatened by his talent. He's not that good.	5	3
I just think Don will hate him, and then he'll hate me.	5	3
I'll be there. I'll handle Don.	5	3
- How can you hear anything? - I'm following your advice.	5	3
I'm being bathed in commercials.	5	3
My God, you're so square, you've got corners.	5	3
I have to make sure I look like the man.	5	3
If Betty calls, you know, or the kids, tell them I'll call them in the morning.	5	3
What did she want anyway?	5	3
Who knows?	5	3
Well, have fun.	5	3
And I don't mean that.	5	3
This is backstage. That's the real backstage.	5	3
Nice to see you.	5	3
- We're here to see the Rolling Stones. - They're not here.	5	3
Well, actually, we're here to see their manager, Allen Klein.	5	3
- He's not here either. - I'm Harry Crane. I'm on the list.	5	3
There's no list.	5	3
Will you let us know when they get here?	5	3
Sir, I promise you'll know.	5	3
Should have talked him out of this at the dinner table.	5	3
Well, we either wait for them to show up or wait for them to come out of there.	5	3
Hey, mister, tell your friend I'll trade him a joint for a cigarette.	5	3
You can have one for free.	5	3
No, I just wanted to make sure you guys weren't cops.	5	3
Can you light this for me?	5	3
- There's a cop right over there. - He's cool.	5	3
- What are you doing? - They're cool.	5	3
They don't look cool.	5	3
- What are you two doing here? - We're here on business.	5	3
- What kind of business? - Advertising.	5	3
Like Bewitched?	5	3
You're Derwood and he's Mr. Kravitz.	5	3
Are you sure you want to?	5	3
It's been too long.	5	3
I thought that's what you wanted.	5	3
You know who has the best stuff?	5	3
- Charlton Heston. - Who's that?	5	3
We went to his house, he came out naked.	5	3
He's a very good-looking man.	5	3
I guess if I looked like that, I would be naked a lot, too.	5	3
In fairness, I don't think he knew we were there.	5	3
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.	5	3
We wanted him to be the voice of VapoRub.	5	3
Right? Wouldn't that be perfect?	5	3
She just said she doesn't know who he is.	5	3
Come on, they're letting us in. I told them how important you are.	5	3
- Thank you. - No, just Harold.	5	3
- Who'd you tell them I was? - Just go.	5	3
Hey, he's getting me in, not you.	5	3
I'll send for you.	5	3
She knows what she's doing.	5	3
You really think you're gonna get the Rolling Stones	5	3
- to do a TV ad? - They did one for cereal in England.	5	3
It must have been a long time ago.	5	3
It was three years ago. When you were probably, what, 11?	5	3
You see someone do that in a movie?	5	3
You need to relax.	5	3
So what do you like so much about the Rolling Stones?	5	3
Why don't you get me backstage and you'll see?	5	3
What do you feel when you hear them?	5	3
Brian Jones.	5	3
He's a troubadour.	5	3
So you feel romantic.	5	3
God, you're like a psychiatrist.	5	3
What do you know about psychiatrists?	5	3
Do you have a business card or something I could try on the doorman?	5	3
I'll make breakfast.	5	3
If, if, if.	5	3
You know what? I am hungry.	5	3
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.	5	3
So what do you think? They gonna show?	5	3
Stop looking at your watch. They're gonna come when they come.	5	3
They're gonna come right down that hallway and I'm gonna jump on Brian like Jack Ruby.	5	3
And what do you expect to happen?	5	3
I'll get into that dressing room	5	3
and I'm gonna stare at him while he tunes his guitar.	5	3
He'll see me from across the room.	5	3
I'm Lady Jane. He'll know that.	5	3
Then what are you gonna do?	5	3
I don't know. Whatever he wants.	5	3
And what do you think he wants?	5	3
None of you want any of us to have a good time just 'cause you never did.	5	3
No, we're worried about you.	5	3
Got it! I got it!	5	3
They want to do it. I have never seen people more excited.	5	3
Wait, you met them?	5	3
- They're here. They're here. - They're here.	5	3
Who were you talking to?	5	3
They even sounded just like them when they were singing.	5	3
They played for me.	5	3
I'm sorry I failed, Don.	5	3
We can try again tomorrow. Asbury Park?	5	3
Forget it. Manager looked right through us.	5	3
You want the last one?	5	3
There were 20.	5	3
I thought you were getting it for your family.	5	3
You know what? Let them get their own.	5	3
You bring home a bag of food and they go at it, and there's nothing left for you.	5	3
Eat first.	5	3
That's my recommendation to people who say they're getting married and having kids.	5	3
Eat first.	5	3
- Sure you don't want it? - Harry, you have to go.	5	3
Just let me sit here for a second.	5	3
I have to get home.	5	3
Those girls, Don.	5	3
Those young girls.	5	3
They are so much fun.	5	3
Everybody's having fun. They're all on drugs.	5	3
You're on drugs.	5	3
You signed the Tradewinds. Who the hell are they?	5	3
Just go inside.	5	3
What are we gonna tell Raymond?	5	3
That the Rolling Stones aren't good for Heinz.	5	3
Yeah.	5	3
His daughterjust probably wanted to meet them.	5	3
I don't think they're good for her, either.	5	3
I'm gonna leave the bag. Jennifer has me on a diet.	5	3
- We should do this again. - Bye, Harry.	5	3
I waited as long as I could, but we've got to go.	5	3
Really?	5	3
Drink too much with the Stones?	5	3
No, we didn't get to meet them.	5	3
Well, you'll have plenty of time to tell me. It takes forever to get to Fire Island.	5	3
Did Betty call?	5	3
No. Let's go.	5	3
Megan.	5	3
What?	5	3
I have to tell you something.	5	3
- What happened? - It's Betty.	5	3
She might be sick. Really sick.	5	3
What?	5	3
They found a tumor.	5	3
That's terrible.	5	3
Why didn't you tell me?	5	3
I didn't know how you'd react.	5	3
What, did you think I'd be happy?	5	3
I don't know what I thought. I just knew she wouldn't want you to know.	5	3
Well, it affects me.	5	3
There's a possibility that it's nothing.	5	3
And if it's something, we'll deal with it.	5	3
- You know I love Sally, and... - No, no, no.	5	3
I don't want to have that conversation.	5	3
Great. Then let's go. Your trunks on the dresser.	5	3
No.	5	3
I just can't.	5	3
Megan, you are 26 years old.	5	3
So I don't understand death?	5	3
I understand you went to that concert last night,	5	3
but now it's suddenly too overwhelming when we're supposed to go see my friends.	5	3
Come on.	5	3
There's nothing you can do.	5	3
It's okay.	5	3
This is very provocative.	5	3
That one. I was at the movies.	5	3
Well, not the movies. I was in Times Square at a peep show.	5	3
- Shouldn't we wait for Roger? - For what?	5	3
He doesn't even come to the meetings that are important.	5	3
- Go on. - There's a resume in there.	5	3
Okay.	5	3
So you were at Needham for a long time and a lot of other places for a short time.	5	3
I checked his references thoroughly or I wouldn't have brought him in.	5	3
Would you let him talk?	5	3
I'm opinionated, but I know if you were my boss,	5	3
"I would have no problem saying, ""Okay, Don."""	5	3
Unless you want me to call you Mr. Draper. I worked for someone like that.	5	3
- Kirk Whitby? - I'm not gonna say.	5	3
You wouldn't want me running all over town telling your secrets.	5	3
Well, I wouldn't want you grumbling behind my back, either.	5	3
You're right. I shouldn't have said that.	5	3
I just wanted to make you smile.	5	3
I'll be honest.	5	3
I've admired you since the letter.	5	3
I thought it was the funniest thing I ever read.	5	3
"And the fact that I can say ""The letter"" and everyone knows what I'm talking about."	5	3
I just want to be a part of this place.	5	3
I think it's on the way up.	5	3
Between you and Margaret,	5	3
she's very interesting.	5	3
And I think I made it clear, so are you.	5	3
Pleasure to meet you, Michael.	5	3
Good work.	5	3
Thanks.	5	3
Promise me you didn't just hire the handsomest one.	5	3
Anything else?	5	3
Get him set up and let him haggle with Lane.	5	3
Roger, I see you've met Mr. Ginsberg.	5	3
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of throwing something through this window.	5	3
- How'd it go? - Good.	5	3
See? I'm proud of you.	5	3
Mr. Ginsberg, follow me.	5	3
"I'm sorry. My stomach rumbles sometimes and it can sound like the ""F"" word."	5	3
You know, I thought you were crazy when I met you,	5	3
and you have confirmed it by not acting the way that you acted with me.	5	3
You told me not to act that way.	5	3
And the fact that you can control it really scares me.	5	3
So I'm not getting the job?	5	3
No, you start tomorrow.	5	3
I would like to pick you up and spin you around right now,	5	3
but I don't want people to think that's how I got the job.	5	3
Well, I'm glad you're excited.	5	3
Come on, be proud of me. I need it.	5	3
Nobody in the world cares I got the job but you.	5	3
Then I'm happy.	5	3
I can't believe this.	5	3
You should have just gone into work.	5	3
Come on.	5	3
- Do you want me to turn down the TV? - It's fine.	5	3
Henry Francis.	5	3
Well, tell Jim His Honor is not going to Michigan.	5	3
Because Romney's a clown and I don't want him standing next to him.	5	3
Because he's got a city to run.	5	3
Can we talk later?	5	3
Francis residence.	5	3
This is Betty.	5	3
Okay.	5	3
Yes.	5	3
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.	5	3
Okay.	5	3
Goodbye.	5	3
It's benign.	5	3
I knew it.	5	3
I'm so happy.	5	3
You're okay, you know.	5	3
I feel like I just got off a boat from China.	5	3
Hey, everything's okay.	5	3
No, it's good. It's good.	5	3
It's nice to be put through the wringer and find out I'm just fat.	5	3
Betty, come on.	5	3
You're exhausted.	5	3
That's what it is, isn't it?	5	3
I don't know how many ways to tell you,	5	3
but I don't see it.	5	3
I know.	5	3
- Your mother's obese. - Hey.	5	3
Listen to me, I feel like I've been given a gift.	5	3
Like Scrooge seeing his tombstone.	5	3
Oh, my God, this is what it could be. But it's not gonna be.	5	3
Saturday night was fun.	5	3
Okay.	5	3
I'd like to say that I've gathered you all here	5	3
so you may remember how small this agency once was.	5	3
Mohawk Airlines has chosen to return to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.	5	3
Now, now.	5	3
I'm just pleased that after a long effort, I was able to sign them.	5	3
I've also hired a new copywriter	5	3
and look forward to great success, with your help.	5	3
And, of course, Mr. Sterling will be handling the day to day.	5	3
But rest assured, everything he knows, I'll know.	5	3
You gonna break that over its nose?	5	3
Forget everything I said before.	5	3
- Excuse me? - That's the last guy I hired.	5	3
Hey.	5	3
- Roger. - What?	5	3
Little prick dangled it in front of me and took it away.	5	3
It was disrespectful.	5	3
You know, I used to love that kid.	5	3
I would hold his hand and help him up on the swing set.	5	3
He grew up.	5	3
- What did you expect? - I'm tired of it, Don.	5	3
I'm tired of trying to prove I still have any value around here.	5	3
I'm exhausted from hanging onto the ledge and having	5	3
some kid's foot on my fingertips.	5	3
Bombs away.	5	3
Betty has cancer.	5	3
Really?	5	3
I don't know.	5	3
They're waiting on tests.	5	3
Well, that would solve everything.	5	3
You want me to make a call?	5	3
She probably knows already.	5	3
I'm the one that has to call.	5	3
She's a fighter.	5	3
Come on.	5	3
I just imagine them growing up without a mother.	5	3
I never had one.	5	3
Megan will try,	5	3
but what are they gonna do?	5	3
How does that end up?	5	3
Actual life and death.	5	3
I've given up on that.	5	3
I can't do that.	5	3
When is everything gonna get back to normal?	5	3
- Henry Francis. - Hi, Henry. It's Don.	5	3
Hello, Don.	5	3
I wanted to know if there was any news	5	3
about Betty.	5	3
I didn't realize she...	5	3
She's fine. She's out of the woods.	5	3
- Well, that's great news. - It is.	5	3
You know, we're about to put supper on the table.	5	3
I'll let you go.	5	3
Who was it?	5	3
Nobody.	5	3
Betty's fine.	5	3
I'm glad to hear it.	5	3
You're such an optimist.	5	3
She just needs to have something to call you about.	5	3
Take you to dinner?	5	3
Sure.	5	3
Pete Fox died.	5	3
Fifty-seven years old, for crying out loud.	5	3
I don't know who that is, Pop.	5	3
Red Sox.	5	3
Right field, he played.	5	3
I got the job.	5	3
You don't say.	5	3
What do you want to eat?	5	3
What do I want to eat?	5	3
We should get girls.	5	3
An old one and a young one.	5	3
I got a rye bread and some farmer cheese.	5	3
Look at me.	5	3
What are you doing?	5	3
Come on.	5	3
- Don't you like it? - It's good.	5	3
Aren't you going to finish?	5	3
I'm full.	5	3
Can I watch TV?	5	3
Go ahead.	5	3
You sound terrible.	5	4
You even look terrible.	5	4
You don't.	5	4
I'm going to stand over here.	5	4
Fine, if you think you'll be safe over there by yourself.	5	4
Going up.	5	4
So am I. Thank you.	5	4
My God, Don!	5	4
My bad penny.	5	4
Andrea, this is my wife, Megan.	5	4
Megan, this is Andrea.	5	4
 She's a freelance writer from the old firm.	5	4
- Nice to meet you. - Yes, you as well.	5	4
Well, goodbye.	5	4
It was nice meeting you.	5	4
- Look... - You look.	5	4
How many times is this going to happen?	5	4
What? I worked with her six years ago.	5	4
We're in Midtown. I'm going to run into people.	5	4
You know, there are some parts of town	5	4
where we can run into some people I worked with.	5	4
AII they care about is that they're see-through.	5	4
Why is transparency desirable in pantyhose?	5	4
I can see fine.	5	4
You want to get in here with me?	5	4
 - Hello, Pegasus. - Hey, you.	5	4
- You have to let me announce you. - Go ahead.	5	4
Hello, Stanley, Ginso.	5	4
I have amazing photos.	5	4
Crime scene snaps from Chicago's student nurse massacre.	5	4
- Not suitable for publication. - What?	5	4
Oh, my God!	5	4
I'm telling you, you're upset over nothing.	5	4
- You're making it worse. I'll get over it. - Megan.	5	4
I'm fine.	5	4
You should be.	5	4
- They look like rag dolls. - Were they raped?	5	4
They don't know, but a couple of these are naked.	5	4
It went on for hours.	5	4
- The rest just waited. - They were tied up.	5	4
I'm sorry I'm late.	5	4
Megan. I've got some pictures.	5	4
Ginsberg, you got to see these.	5	4
I'll see you later.	5	4
And I'll see you later.	5	4
The sex murders in Chicago. The student nurses.	5	4
- Really? - Take it.	5	4
- Oh, my God! - Look at the bottom row.	5	4
I think this is going to make the cover, not the riots.	5	4
Really?	5	4
Yeah, we did the riots this week. Watts a year later.	5	4
Plus, there have been five riots this summer.	5	4
I say it's better than even money Mr. Luce finds a tasteful way to do this.	5	4
You know what? Put it away. It's disgusting.	5	4
It's one of those things I wish I didn't see.	5	4
And why are you laughing?	5	4
- We're not laughing. - No, you're excited by it.	5	4
Some girl trussed up like a cut of meat?	5	4
Eight girls, but nine were kidnapped.	5	4
One survived.	5	4
I only am escaped alone to tell thee.	5	4
How did she do that?	5	4
She hid under the bed. He lost count.	5	4
You know what?	5	4
You're sickos.	5	4
Michael.	5	4
He's right.	5	4
It's been 25 minutes. It's not even set.	5	4
I told you the jets are clogged.	5	4
Give me some money. I'll go to the bakery.	5	4
And we need to get beer. Greg likes Schaefer. Do we have time?	5	4
Not if you want me to get the baby out of here by noon.	5	4
Why? He's going to want to see Kevin more than me.	5	4
That's what he's going to say, but he's going to want you right away.	5	4
Let me go get my purse. You're making me very anxious right now.	5	4
It's okay to be anxious. It's normal.	5	4
Everything's going to be unfamiliar for both of you.	5	4
And who knows what he's seen? Who knows what he's done?	5	4
He's a surgeon. He wasn't in combat.	5	4
He saw the same things there he saw here.	5	4
Well, there are other things that happen when men are away, especially at war.	5	4
Stop it.	5	4
Stop talking about men in general, when I know it's all about Daddy.	5	4
Even if there haven't been other women, he's not used to listening to a woman.	5	4
It's just the idea of coming home and finding a little hole in his life	5	4
and sticking his elbow through until he can walk all the way in.	5	4
I know.	5	4
And that's why I want to start with him seeing his son for the first time.	5	4
He'll know how to do that.	5	4
You're right.	5	4
Do you really want a cake?	5	4
Because it's going to take me a while to get dressed.	5	4
Could you?	5	4
Your daughter's on line one.	5	4
Hello, sweetheart. What's the matter?	5	4
Grandma Pauline is still here and I hate her.	5	4
Stay out of her way.	5	4
Your mother will be back Friday morning.	5	4
It is Friday morning.	5	4
Someone called on Henry's phone and said that they couldn't get an airplane flight,	5	4
so someone's driving them back from Buffalo tonight.	5	4
You'd think Henry could get a flight.	5	4
I know. He's so important.	5	4
They call Bobby all the time in sleepaway camp.	5	4
I guess if I was peeing in my pants, they might want to say hi.	5	4
That's not nice.	5	4
Grandma Pauline wears so much perfume.	5	4
Every time she comes near me, I want to barf.	5	4
And you know what else?	5	4
She doesn't believe me,	5	4
that I'm allowed to watch as much TV as I want because it's the summer.	5	4
Your mother lets you do that?	5	4
I'm on vacation.	5	4
I think the best thing is for you to go out in the fresh air and get some sun.	5	4
I did. It's really hot.	5	4
Stop complaining. I don't want you to get rickets in that haunted mansion.	5	4
I'll see you next weekend.	5	4
How are you?	5	4
I have a cold, but you've made me feel better.	5	4
Can't you come get me?	5	4
No. And don't ask again.	5	4
- Okay, bye. - Bye.	5	4
Are you sick?	5	4
I'm great. Let's go.	5	4
So, it starts with Ken Cosgrove climbing out of the muck and walking on dry land.	5	4
He says a bunch of nice stuff about Ginsberg and you.	5	4
"I told him not to use the word ""genius"" about either of us."	5	4
A woman and her secrets.	5	4
The things she'll never tell,	5	4
like how long it took her to get ready or the reason she's smiling.	5	4
A good-looking woman at a party.	5	4
And where she got those incredible shoes.	5	4
Another woman, not too catty, says,	5	4
"""I love your shoes. Where did you get them?"""	5	4
We hold on five seconds of her showing off the shoe from the calf down,	5	4
and this girl's legs will be spectacular. And, yes, you can come to casting.	5	4
That's plenty.	5	4
Are you kidding? I'm ready to take off here.	5	4
I just wanted to hear the tone of your voice	5	4
so I can make sure it's not as annoying as it is in everyday life.	5	4
It's called a regional accent. And believe it or not, you've got one, too.	5	4
We can't all sound like Walter Cronkite.	5	4
Do you like this? I never saw boards for the Cinderella thing.	5	4
Well, you killed it, and for good reason. Cinderella and shoes is a cliché.	5	4
You could have TB.	5	4
Sleeping Beauty? Snow White? Nothing worked?	5	4
They're more about necrophilia than shoes.	5	4
It's footwear. Don't make that mistake.	5	4
- Oh, my God! You're so skinny. - So are you.	5	4
Somebody wants to say hello.	5	4
Jesus, is that him?	5	4
Holy crap, look at him!	5	4
Joanie, I'll get that.	5	4
You have your hands full.	5	4
We thought your flight might be late because of the strike.	5	4
Yeah, we picked up some folks in Honolulu who had been stranded,	5	4
but everything was fine.	5	4
Gail, go get the Brownie.	5	4
I don't think we have any film.	5	4
You know what?	5	4
I'll take Kevin and go get some, so you two can visit a spell.	5	4
Okay, that's a good idea.	5	4
You have supplies in case you have to be gone for a while?	5	4
I have everything.	5	4
And so do you, Greg.	5	4
Get over here.	5	4
Where have you been?	5	4
Out in the wilderness, baby.	5	4
- What are you doing? - Looking for Aspirin.	5	4
- Why don't you have Dawn do it? - I'm embarrassed.	5	4
I've eaten up a bottle since she's been here.	5	4
My husband's an Aspirin addict. I'm so ashamed.	5	4
You're very warm. I'm sending you home.	5	4
I'm sorry about this morning.	5	4
It couldn't be avoided.	5	4
It was a long time ago and I was unhappy.	5	4
Because you were married.	5	4
It's fine. It's just embarrassing.	5	4
Why should you be embarrassed?	5	4
Seriously?	5	4
Because you're married to me now.	5	4
And after Allison and Faye Miller and who knows how many more...	5	4
I was divorced.	5	4
And now you're not.	5	4
And that kind of careless appetite,	5	4
you can't blame that on Betty.	5	4
I tell you, let it go.	5	4
You brought it up.	5	4
No, I didn't.	5	4
You did.	5	4
And all I can think is you feel guilty, which makes it worse than I thought.	5	4
I married you.	5	4
And I'm going to be with you until I die...	5	4
Which could be this afternoon.	5	4
Is this really how you want to spend my last hours on Earth?	5	4
Sweetie, go home.	5	4
I have to go to this meeting so I can skip the next two.	5	4
At least go lie down.	5	4
Eat your sandwich.	5	4
I'm not hungry.	5	4
My Lord!	5	4
- Those poor souls. - What?	5	4
Nothing.	5	4
Some things are not for children.	5	4
Mommy lets me watch the news.	5	4
You demanded tuna salad, so you're going to sit there until you eat it.	5	4
It has relish in it.	5	4
You haven't even tasted it.	5	4
You hurt my hand.	5	4
Well, I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.	5	4
But you have to be respectful. I know your mother has other rules.	5	4
- She doesn't have rules. - I don't believe that,	5	4
but I believe that she may be distracted.	5	4
And I am sure she would be sick if she knew how you were behaving.	5	4
Now you're going to finish that sandwich, crusts and all.	5	4
I don't care if it takes all day.	5	4
How'd you sleep?	5	4
Very well, thank you.	5	4
What are you doing?	5	4
He's making lunch. He won't listen.	5	4
Greg, honey, I have steak. Mom bought a cake.	5	4
Believe it or not, I had steak in Vietnam.	5	4
I did not have bologna.	5	4
And I'll have veal tonight with my folks.	5	4
What are the three of you up to?	5	4
I'm showing Kevin how good I am with my hands.	5	4
We were talking about the riots.	5	4
Plenty of Negroes in Saigon and they're plenty brave.	5	4
I think we should have a rule that	5	4
you have to wear your uniform all the time when you're home.	5	4
Gail, is there a chance you could pick up more beer?	5	4
Of course.	5	4
I wanted to get the afternoon paper anyway.	5	4
Thank you so much, Mom.	5	4
We'll be back in time for dinner.	5	4
You look incredible, you know?	5	4
Thank you.	5	4
I need to tell you something.	5	4
Greg, if something happened over there and you feel the need to tell me, you shouldn't.	5	4
And if you do, you certainly shouldn't ask me to hold your hand.	5	4
What? No.	5	4
No, it's not that.	5	4
Listen, Joanie, there's been a change of plans.	5	4
I have to go back.	5	4
- I know, for another 40 days. - No,	5	4
for a year.	5	4
What?	5	4
It was one year here and one year there. That's what they told you.	5	4
Look, I know you're hearing a lot of horrible things about what's going on over there.	5	4
It couldn't be further from the truth. You don't need to worry.	5	4
You did your part. They're a bunch of liars.	5	4
Nobody lied to anybody.	5	4
It's more complicated. It's war.	5	4
It doesn't stop for our plans. And I've come to terms with that.	5	4
Now we have 10 days together. Let's not waste it.	5	4
I need to store up as much of you as possible.	5	4
And, yes, you can come to casting.	5	4
And you think it sounds good, wait till you see it in print.	5	4
"""You'll never tell. They'll never be able to."""	5	4
I don't know. What do you think, Mr. Butler?	5	4
I think Ken was right. You're a genius.	5	4
Square-on strategy.	5	4
I think the boys did a good job.	5	4
The girl should be European-looking.	5	4
Maybe get a French girl.	5	4
Great.	5	4
So?	5	4
Sold.	5	4
I have to tell you, young man, you really know women.	5	4
I've never heard that before.	5	4
This really gets inside their heads.	5	4
Well, to tell you the truth, they confuse me.	5	4
I mean, I keep thinking about Cinderella.	5	4
We were going to come in here and talk about Cinderella, but it's too dark.	5	4
Really?	5	4
We were kind of hoping for it.	5	4
Nah, I don't think so.	5	4
I mean, she's running down this dark side street.	5	4
And it's outside a castle, so it's got those walls and the cobblestones.	5	4
And she's running, but she's only got this one incredible shoe for her incredible gown,	5	4
so she's hobbling, wounded prey.	5	4
She can hear him behind her, his measured footsteps catching up.	5	4
She turns a corner.	5	4
Those big shadows.	5	4
And she's scared.	5	4
And then she feels a hand on her shoulder and she turns around.	5	4
And it doesn't matter what he looks like,	5	4
he's handsome at that moment offering her her shoe.	5	4
She takes it.	5	4
She knows she's not safe, but she doesn't care.	5	4
I guess we know in the end	5	4
she wants to be caught.	5	4
See? It's too dark.	5	4
Why don't we do that?	5	4
The man said sold.	5	4
You wanted Cinderella anyway. You forgot that.	5	4
No, I said it was a cliché.	5	4
That's because you thought they wouldn't like it,	5	4
but in your heart, you knew it was good.	5	4
In my heart, I'm on the verge of throwing you in front of a cab.	5	4
Okay.	5	4
So however proud of yourself you're feeling right now,	5	4
"just know that everything I'm saying has ""or else"" after it."	5	4
Don't do that again.	5	4
Think of those ideas in front of me.	5	4
Don't do that again.	5	4
I gotta make a call.	5	4
He's such a decent guy.	5	4
You know you almost got fired just now.	5	4
I don't think you're right about that.	5	4
I'm positive.	5	4
Mr. Draper is on line one.	5	4
Hello. How'd it go?	5	4
Good. What are you up to?	5	4
I'm keeping your chair warm.	5	4
So I'll swing by and get you in an hour?	5	4
Well, why don't you just go home, climb into bed?	5	4
- Really? - Yes.	5	4
I only need another couple of hours.	5	4
And, Don,	5	4
no smoking.	5	4
Mohawk says that L.B.J. is scared of forcing the mechanics to arbitration	5	4
because he has midterm elections and he's worried about losing the labor vote.	5	4
- That's good news. - Yes, it is.	5	4
The strike's going to go on for at least a couple more weeks	5	4
and Mohawk can sop up all the extra routes.	5	4
So, they want us to walk them through the campaign first thing Monday morning.	5	4
A phone call will do.	5	4
The campaign, of course.	5	4
We're ready to go.	5	4
Have a good weekend.	5	4
Damn it.	5	4
- Good night, everyone, Clara. - Good night, Mr. Campbell.	5	4
Where's Ginsberg?	5	4
He's probably everywhere after Don scattered his ashes.	5	4
Apparently he went haywire in the presentation downstairs.	5	4
I don't care. Call him.	5	4
I just did. He's not home.	5	4
Is he coming back?	5	4
You know what? I'm going to go out there and find him.	5	4
I'm going to start with the whole world	5	4
and then I'm going to eventually check my apartment.	5	4
What are you doing tonight?	5	4
I don't know. What did you have in mind?	5	4
Are you drunk? Get your feet off that desk.	5	4
I need you to work up something for Mohawk.	5	4
"Oh, I'm sorry. For Mohawk, your ""man"" is Ginsberg."	5	4
Let's say you were to do this for me,	5	4
and on Monday you explain to Ginsberg and Campbell that I asked you to...	5	4
Only I asked you sometime last week.	5	4
Do you have a brief?	5	4
Did Ginsberg have a brief?	5	4
I never told Ginsberg, okay? You have to remember that.	5	4
You know about the airline strike, right?	5	4
Yes. Why is Mohawk still flying?	5	4
Because even though all the other mechanics are on strike...	5	4
They need more wrenches or something.	5	4
...Mohawk's mechanics have a side deal, so they have to keep working.	5	4
They must love that.	5	4
Yeah, well, they're going to love the overtime.	5	4
American Airlines is taking everything big	5	4
and giving their northeast corridor to Mohawk.	5	4
So what do you want?	5	4
"How about something like, ""Mohawk, breaking the strike one flight at a time""?"	5	4
"Or maybe, ""Fly over the picket line with Mohawk""?"	5	4
Hey, Trotsky, you're in advertising.	5	4
Fine. So what's the angle?	5	4
Campbell or I had this idea that it would be something about,	5	4
you know, how times are tough and you can't get anywhere.	5	4
So thank God, Mohawk is offering emergency service.	5	4
"You don't want to use the word ""emergency"" with an airplane."	5	4
I don't want to do any of this. I'll see you Monday.	5	4
Hold on a second.	5	4
You want me to work up an entire corporate image campaign for $10?	5	4
I can make you do it for nothing. I'm the boss.	5	4
You're right. The work is $10, the lie is extra.	5	4
Incredible. What do you make a week, sweetheart?	5	4
You don't know, huh? That's helpful.	5	4
You know, I could fire you.	5	4
Great. There are some portfolios in Joan's office.	5	4
Maybe you could find somebody tonight.	5	4
Why are you doing this to me?	5	4
Because you're being very demanding for someone who has no other choice.	5	4
Dazzle me.	5	4
Fine.	5	4
How much you want?	5	4
How much you got?	5	4
- $400. - Give me all of it.	5	4
Jesus!	5	4
It better be good.	5	4
Do you want me to take your watch?	5	4
I'm on my way out. Are you staying?	5	4
Hello. Good night.	5	4
Yeah. Something came up. Would you tell Patricia she can go home?	5	4
Okay.	5	4
Get in here.	5	4
- What are you doing here? - We didn't get to talk.	5	4
We've done all the talking we're ever going to do.	5	4
Are you okay?	5	4
How the hell did you get in here?	5	4
I have a way with doormen.	5	4
I have some bad news for you.	5	4
You can either take the steps or you can go off the balcony,	5	4
because if you run into my wife on the way out of here, you're going to wish you had.	5	4
Forceful.	5	4
My, oh, my!	5	4
Everybody probably thinks that she did this, but I know it was you.	5	4
You really should go. I gotta lie down.	5	4
I'll take the steps.	5	4
You know what, take the service elevator.	5	4
Goodbye. I'm sorry. You've gotta understand.	5	4
Are you okay?	5	4
Please, you have to go.	5	4
It was just sex. It doesn't mean anything.	5	4
I'm sorry. I've gotta lie down.	5	4
He's here! My mystery date...	5	4
The girl under the bed...	5	4
I'd be surprised if she could ever talk again.	5	4
That poor thing, paralyzed with fear	5	4
while he opened that door eight times,	5	4
and dragged another one out.	5	4
And that...	5	4
No, as much as I'd love to go, I can't make any plans until they waltz through that door.	5	4
You need to take out the trash.	5	4
Right now?	5	4
Take out the trash or you can go to bed right now,	5	4
watch the sun set from your bedroom window.	5	4
It's the saddest thing in the world.	5	4
If I take out the trash, will you tell me about the murder?	5	4
No. I will not bargain with you.	5	4
How old are you?	5	4
That's something we girls keep to ourselves.	5	4
Was your mom strict?	5	4
No, but my father was and I'm a better person for it.	5	4
I know you don't think so, but I'm a good person.	5	4
Sally, I just think someone in your world needs to discipline you	5	4
so you can start acting like an adult.	5	4
My father.	5	4
I remember one time he was sleeping on the couch in the living room and I walked by.	5	4
And all of a sudden, out of nowhere,	5	4
he kicked me so hard that I actually flew across the room and hit a piece of furniture.	5	4
"And then he looked at me and he said, ""That's for nothing, so look out."""	5	4
That's not very nice.	5	4
No,	5	4
but it was valuable advice.	5	4
When in doubt, go with the most expensive, right, Pops?	5	4
I don't want any wine.	5	4
Okay, can we all cheer up, please?	5	4
We're together, I have a new baby boy, not to mention this place costs a fortune.	5	4
So how are we starting? The lovely signora?	5	4
I'll have a gin fizz.	5	4
Everybody else is having wine, but you have to give me a second.	5	4
- How are you doing? - Can't complain.	5	4
Enjoy yourself.	5	4
Thank you. You, too, sir.	5	4
First armored division, Fort Hood.	5	4
Do you want me to come back?	5	4
No, but you can recommend something.	5	4
Are you in a rush?	5	4
No, it's just that I got a bunch of tables.	5	4
Well, I'm sorry if that little display of respect is slowing you down,	5	4
but a lot of kids your age would be thrilled to be waiting tables tonight.	5	4
I'm sorry, sir. Of course.	5	4
This is a nice one.	5	4
Thank you. That'd be perfect.	5	4
The scampi looks very good.	5	4
- I'm sorry, this is a painful charade. - Mom, please.	5	4
I just don't understand it. Everyone else is trying to come home.	5	4
Ruth, Greg is facing this with great bravery	5	4
and I'm proud of him.	5	4
He did his time. You've got to talk him out of it.	5	4
Mom, I don't want your grandson hearing this argument.	5	4
Joe, you were in the service.	5	4
Can't you write a letter to your congressman and tell him he's got a family?	5	4
Why? Is some congressman going to talk him out of going back?	5	4
I don't understand.	5	4
I'm putting a moratorium on this conversation.	5	4
Now we are either going to have this dinner that I've been dreaming about for months,	5	4
or we can all go home.	5	4
He didn't tell you about it.	5	4
Of course not.	5	4
What is she talking about?	5	4
Did you have a say in this?	5	4
You're a father now.	5	4
- What? - Joanie, calm down.	5	4
You volunteered?	5	4
They need me.	5	4
You know, Joanie plays the accordion.	5	4
Hello?	5	4
Is somebody there?	5	4
What are you doing?	5	4
I fell asleep.	5	4
Well, it's time to go home.	5	4
I will, in a bit.	5	4
Come on, I don't want to walk out alone.	5	4
I don't know. I think I'll just stay here.	5	4
You can hop in a cab.	5	4
I happen to have a lot of cash for once.	5	4
Even if a cab was going to take me, they're not going to take me past 96th Street.	5	4
Really?	5	4
Well, then, take the subway.	5	4
My brother won't let me.	5	4
You know, with everything that's happening in Chicago.	5	4
Well, you're not a nurse.	5	4
Right.	5	4
Is there a riot in Harlem?	5	4
There was a thing in Bed-Stuy.	5	4
There's a lot of police.	5	4
Well, I know that doesn't make it safer.	5	4
My boyfriend's in Chicago. He's covering the riots.	5	4
Is that right?	5	4
Why don't you stay with me tonight?	5	4
I've stayed here before. I'll be fine.	5	4
Get your things.	5	4
Are you asleep?	5	4
You're home.	5	4
You're mumbling.	5	4
How the hell did you get in here?	5	4
I was worried about you.	5	4
You left the back door unlocked.	5	4
- Why can't you leave me alone? - I can't.	5	4
You have to.	5	4
We're alone.	5	4
I just want it fast.	5	4
No.	5	4
I know she's coming home.	5	4
I'll be gone. I promise.	5	4
Andrea.	5	4
I can feel you against me.	5	4
Remember that night at Lincoln Center when you took me back to the loading dock?	5	4
Your wife was waiting inside.	5	4
So it's just me, my brother, who's 19, and my mother, who says she's 39.	5	4
Like Jack Benny.	5	4
Is your brother in school?	5	4
No, he delivers furniture and argues with my mother about joining the Army.	5	4
You were saying something in the taxi about Don and I cut you off.	5	4
No, I was finished.	5	4
You can talk to me.	5	4
I was his secretary, you know?	5	4
You were?	5	4
- So how did you... - I didn't even ask for it.	5	4
Sometimes they drag the secretaries in for focus groups to try things	5	4
and I was discovered,	5	4
like Esther Blodgett.	5	4
Oh, God! I'm really drunk.	5	4
Y'all drink a lot.	5	4
So what were you going to say?	5	4
I was going to say...	5	4
Go ahead. You can talk.	5	4
- I'm trying to. - I'm sorry.	5	4
I was going to say I hope you won't tell Mr. Draper about me sleeping there.	5	4
You two talk sometimes.	5	4
Nah.	5	4
We have to stick together.	5	4
I know we're not really in the same situation,	5	4
but I was the only one like me there for a long time.	5	4
I know it's hard.	5	4
I appreciate that.	5	4
Do you want to be a copywriter?	5	4
No. I like my job.	5	4
Yep.	5	4
You're right.	5	4
Copywriter's tough,	5	4
especially for a woman.	5	4
Do you think I act like a man?	5	4
I guess you have to a little.	5	4
I try, but...	5	4
I don't know if I have it in me.	5	4
I don't know if I want to.	5	4
I'm sorry. I can't sleep.	5	4
Well, you cannot sneak up on someone my age, especially in this house.	5	4
I'm scared.	5	4
Can I sit with you?	5	4
Only for a bit.	5	4
What's that for?	5	4
Why are you scared?	5	4
I read the newspaper.	5	4
Honey. Did you pull it out of the trash?	5	4
Why did that man do that?	5	4
Well, probably because he hates his mother.	5	4
- I don't understand what happened. - What happened?	5	4
Those girls got ready for bed,	5	4
and there was a knock on the door, and a handsome man was there.	5	4
And maybe one of them knew him, but probably not.	5	4
Because he was probably just watching them from afar.	5	4
AII those young, innocent nurses	5	4
in their short uniforms stirring his desire.	5	4
For what?	5	4
What do you think? You're old enough to know.	5	4
Why didn't they run away?	5	4
Because they were scared.	5	4
"They probably thought, ""He can't rape nine of us."""	5	4
Why not?	5	4
You just can't.	5	4
They didn't know it was going to be worse than that.	5	4
They didn't know what was in store for them.	5	4
Now I'm really scared.	5	4
It's not going to happen,	5	4
not while I've got my burglar alarm.	5	4
How am I going to sleep?	5	4
Get the water.	5	4
What's that?	5	4
It's Seconal.	5	4
Do you know how to take a pill?	5	4
You two stop it.	5	4
Damn it, Joanie!	5	4
- Stop it. - Gail, out!	5	4
Take him out of here!	5	4
Open this door or I will kick it down!	5	4
Who goes back?	5	4
I will throw a parade for you every day to thank you for preserving freedom.	5	4
It's done.	5	4
Well, you can't make a decision like that without me	5	4
and you have never understood that.	5	4
If this was World War II and the Japs were still attacking us,	5	4
"you'd say, ""Yes, of course!"""	5	4
Soldiers wanted to come home from World War II also!	5	4
I've got my orders, you've got yours.	5	4
- Where are you going? - To meet the boys for a drink.	5	4
He just needs to blow off steam.	5	4
Don't get involved, Mother.	5	4
You're a military wife. You make sacrifices.	5	4
Someone's Kevin is over there and he's going to get hurt and Greg won't be there.	5	4
But our Kevin is right in there and he doesn't care.	5	4
It's a year. You can do it. I'll help.	5	4
No.	5	4
Go lie down. You don't even know how tired you are.	5	4
I hope you don't mind the couch.	5	4
Since my roommate moved, the other room has just a pile ofAbe's clothes.	5	4
This is perfect.	5	4
Well, goodnight, then.	5	4
I'll just throw these out.	5	4
Thanks.	5	4
Goodnight.	5	4
I'll see you later.	5	4
No, you won't.	5	4
Don't argue with me.	5	4
I have to get out of here.	5	4
Hotel next time?	5	4
No next time. That was a mistake.	5	4
A mistake you love making.	5	4
I'd better not see you again.	5	4
You're not going to ruin this.	5	4
You loved it.	5	4
And you'll love it again because you are a sick, sick...	5	4
Hello? We're home.	5	4
Ma.	5	4
Ma!	5	4
What's going on?	5	4
Where's Sally?	5	4
Sally?	5	4
How are you feeling?	5	4
Where were you?	5	4
I was right there.	5	4
You're burning up.	5	4
No, last night.	5	4
I was waiting for you.	5	4
I came right home.	5	4
You were a mess. I was really worried.	5	4
You don't have to worry about me.	5	4
Okay.	5	4
There are some scrambled eggs in the bowl and I made flapjacks.	5	4
Just coffee.	5	4
Where's Kevin?	5	4
You slept a long time. He was awake and went back to bed already.	5	4
I barely slept at all.	5	4
I've been thinking about it and...	5	4
I want you to go.	5	4
I'll put this away.	5	4
I'm glad you came around. It's only a year.	5	4
No.	5	4
I want you to go and never come back.	5	4
Damn it, Joanie. They need me.	5	4
Well, then, it works out, because we don't.	5	4
I'm very important there.	5	4
I have 20 docs and medics who rely on me. They look to me for my skill and leadership.	5	4
I'm glad the Army makes you feel like a man,	5	4
because I'm sick of trying to do it.	5	4
The Army makes me feel like a good man.	5	4
You're not a good man.	5	4
You never were,	5	4
even before we were married, and you know what I'm talking about.	5	4
If I walk out that door, that's it.	5	4
That's it.	5	4
It's over.	5	4
State highway patrol.	5	5
There has been an accident at Tremble Road and the expressway.	5	5
Does it go like that all day?	5	5
I suppose, but I don't hear it.	5	5
You're not ready at all?	5	5
We have time.	5	5
The first half of a football match is just flirting.	5	5
I'd like to get there, grab a nice seat, enjoy the chitchat.	5	5
If it's a matter of you and I having a nice lunch,	5	5
perhaps a ride in the boats in the park, hmm?	5	5
You don't even know what's good for you.	5	5
 Spending an afternoon in the pub with our friends.	5	5
One, they're your friends, and recent ones at that.	5	5
Two, I have no fond memories of hours spent in pubs watching football.	5	5
- Three... - You love football.	5	5
No, that's my father.	5	5
And I hate this business of bringing England over in pieces.	5	5
It's strictly for the homesick.	5	5
But it's filled with immigrants like us.	5	5
How lovely your face becomes when you tell me you need something.	5	5
I'd be happy if you'd just pretend to have a good time.	5	5
Then pretend I shall.	5	5
♪ God save our gracious Queen. ♪	5	5
♪ Long live our noble Queen. ♪	5	5
♪ God save our Queen. ♪	5	5
 Now, I want both of you to make a pledge	5	5
that this is the end of football for some time.	5	5
We beat the bloody Jerries for the World Cup, darling.	5	5
That is the end of football.	5	5
I'll believe that when I see it.	5	5
Is Lane this way about that?	5	5
Perhaps at one time.	5	5
But right now he's been in the midst of a messy divorce with Great Britain.	5	5
I dare say my blood's running now.	5	5
Good day to be an Englishman.	5	5
I don't know if I caught it. Are you an account man at the firm?	5	5
No, financial chief.	5	5
You should have one give me a call.	5	5
My name's on the door.	5	5
I don't find Britain any more moral than here nowadays.	5	5
The boys look like girls and the girls,	5	5
they don't seem to be concerned with manners, do they?	5	5
I find New York better than London,	5	5
because 50 miles away, things are infinitely more wholesome.	5	5
You'll have your farmland. Give it some time.	5	5
She wants to raise hogs.	5	5
Just take the last booth.	5	5
Kenny?	5	5
Oh.	5	5
Hi. What are you doing here?	5	5
Trying to get ptomaine poisoning.	5	5
I'll see you at the office.	5	5
Unless you have plans.	5	5
Oh, no. It's Cynthia's uncle.	5	5
He's trying to break into radio. I'm gonna try and talk him out of it.	5	5
I'd love to meet him.	5	5
He's painfully shy.	5	5
I get it.	5	5
You want to be alone.	5	5
Do you mind?	5	5
Okay, now on to new business.	5	5
- Roger? - Nope.	5	5
- Pete? - No.	5	5
- Mr. Cooper? - No, dear.	5	5
- Don? - Nope.	5	5
Very well, then.	5	5
If there are any addendum's for the minutes, please give them to me by 4:00.	5	5
Excuse me, gentlemen. if I may.	5	5
I have a bit of new business.	5	5
Taking leave again?	5	5
Not at all.	5	5
I don't know if you're aware, but England won the World Cup.	5	5
Cup of what?	5	5
Anyway, I've begun a bit of a friendship with Edwin Baker,	5	5
senior vice president of public relations for Jaguar Cars Incorporated.	5	5
Completely unprovoked, he made it clear	5	5
that since their impending merger with BMC,	5	5
they're looking for a new agency to break them into the American market.	5	5
- Dinner is set. - Yowza!	5	5
- Spectacular. - I want one.	5	5
"So, Mr. Pryce, that's ""Jaguar,"" like the cat?"	5	5
Indeed.	5	5
Why are you smiling?	5	5
Jaguar, well. We'd probably have to hire 10 people	5	5
who will be on the payroll for months.	5	5
Are you sure we can afford it?	5	5
My Lordy. New business. Not here, sir.	5	5
I suppose if you brought in an account of this stature,	5	5
I might say something different.	5	5
It's $3 million, tops.	5	5
It's a car and you know it.	5	5
You know, I'd be happy to ride shotgun.	5	5
If nothing else, I could pick up the check, make you look important.	5	5
I think that would make you look important.	5	5
But, honestly, Lane, if you want any of us along...	5	5
Cooper speaks British.	5	5
I believe Edwin and I relate to one another on matters both business and personal,	5	5
Englishman to Englishman.	5	5
I love that car.	5	5
Should someone give him a few pointers?	5	5
That's a good idea.	5	5
I'm terribly busy.	5	5
- Roger. - I'd be glad to.	5	5
Oh, Don, just a minute.	5	5
Trudy dictated directions to Clara for Saturday night.	5	5
I promise, no charades, no bridge, just good home cooking and drinks.	5	5
This Saturday, I think we're going away.	5	5
I doubt that.	5	5
Trudy will only act on a certainty.	5	5
Okay.	5	5
Thank you.	5	5
- Dawn, can you get Mrs. Draper? - She's inside.	5	5
I'm almost done.	5	5
So, I want you to call your new best friend Trudy Campbell	5	5
and tell her that we're unavailable this weekend.	5	5
You already said we were coming.	5	5
To who?	5	5
I don't know. Trudy said you did.	5	5
Well, she got this far by subterfuge.	5	5
She won't feel bad when you pull the plug on it.	5	5
- I like her. - I like her, too.	5	5
But Saturday night in the suburbs?	5	5
That's when you really want to blow your brains out.	5	5
If you want to tell her, you call her.	5	5
Hey!	5	5
Where's Stan and Ginsberg?	5	5
Why? Do you have something you want to tell them?	5	5
No.	5	5
Listen, about this morning...	5	5
- I thought we had a pact. - It's not about the pact.	5	5
It has nothing to do with the pact. The pact still stands.	5	5
Then why didn't you introduce me?	5	5
I'm a copywriter. I'm not gonna take your job.	5	5
I'd love a shred of privacy. Just a shred.	5	5
You know? Is that too much to ask?	5	5
Okay, listen.	5	5
You know I write stories.	5	5
You're still doing that?	5	5
Well, I decided to fly under the radar.	5	5
I have a nom de plume and I've had quite a bit of success	5	5
in a particular genre, and he's from Farrar Straus.	5	5
Wow, that's exciting.	5	5
I guess.	5	5
Cynthia's trying to talk them into taking the best 20	5	5
and turning them into a collection.	5	5
Twenty? When do you do this?	5	5
I started turning most of my dinners into drinks.	5	5
And if I have only one, I'm in pretty good shape when I get home.	5	5
So, what is it?	5	5
It's between fantasy and science fiction.	5	5
Robots and planets and things. There's whole magazines.	5	5
No, I mean what's your pen name?	5	5
Fine. It's Ben Hargrove.	5	5
Anyway, I could have introduced you,	5	5
and that was wrong, but I just...	5	5
I don't know.	5	5
Well, I wish I felt more relieved.	5	5
It's probably not gonna happen.	5	5
And listen, the pact still stands. If I go anywhere, you go with me.	5	5
Okay.	5	5
So that's some big news.	5	5
Are you here to put in a good word for yourself?	5	5
No.	5	5
A little bird told me you got an RFP from Jaguar.	5	5
And that is a very good sign.	5	5
Yes, I was just going over it.	5	5
"""Request for proposal. Jaguar."" Blah-blah."	5	5
"""One. Have you ever been fired off an account?"""	5	5
There are worse ones than that.	5	5
Would you take a little bit of unsolicited advice?	5	5
It's not pride that's keeping me from asking.	5	5
I certainly am aware that you're skilled in this arena.	5	5
I was.	5	5
Now I guess I'm professor emeritus of accounts.	5	5
Look, most people will tell you it's hard to make a mistake.	5	5
I mean, you just lie.	5	5
But that won't get you anywhere.	5	5
The beauty of this dinner is that if you do it right,	5	5
you can actually have him tell you all the answers.	5	5
In fact, I once got a guy from Dr. Scholl's to fill it out for me.	5	5
There'll be plenty of drinks.	5	5
Not for you. You order a scotch, rocks and water.	5	5
You drink half of it till it turns see-through. You get another.	5	5
Very good.	5	5
And then it's kind of like being on a date.	5	5
Flattery, I suppose.	5	5
Within reason.	5	5
But I find it's best to smile and sit there	5	5
like you've got no place to go and just let them talk.	5	5
Somewhere in the middle of the entree, they'll throw out something revealing.	5	5
And you want to wait till dessert to pounce on it.	5	5
You know, let them know you've got the same problem he has, whatever it is.	5	5
And then you're in a conspiracy.	5	5
"The basis of a ""friendship."""	5	5
Then you whip out the form.	5	5
What if I don't have the same problem?	5	5
It'll probably just be something like he drinks too much, he gambles.	5	5
I once went on a five-minute tear about	5	5
how my mother loved my father more than me,	5	5
and I can assure you that is impossible.	5	5
Very good, then.	5	5
And if, for some reason, he's more reserved?	5	5
Just reverse it.	5	5
Feed him your own personal morsel.	5	5
Oh, I see.	5	5
That's it.	5	5
Get your answers, be nice to the waiter, and don't let him near the check.	5	5
Thank you very much.	5	5
Oh, and find out everything you can about him before you get there.	5	5
- That I've done. - And you still like him?	5	5
I do.	5	5
Let it show.	5	5
I finally got Mrs. Campbell on the line.	5	5
Trudy, I'm glad I got a hold of you. I have some bad news.	5	5
No, you don't. We're building the whole party around you.	5	5
You see, I'm afraid we're not free.	5	5
Don, do you want to go down your list of excuses	5	5
and I'll combat each one individually?	5	5
Or should we just skip to the end?	5	5
If you can't make it Saturday, I will reschedule.	5	5
It's going to happen and I promise you'll have a good time.	5	5
It's too bad your husband can't close a deal like this.	5	5
We both know he's doing just fine.	5	5
7:30 P.M.	5	5
Who's hungry?	5	5
Are you okay?	5	5
I saw you getting a little green in there.	5	5
Those movies are gruesome.	5	5
I think we should go back to riding horses.	5	5
That must have been something.	5	5
Why don't you have a license yet?	5	5
I grew up in Manhattan.	5	5
Just wasn't necessary.	5	5
I like going down to the city.	5	5
There's so much to do.	5	5
Maybe you'll move there when you get older.	5	5
Then you'll get married and you'll move back here.	5	5
I'm not getting married until after college.	5	5
If my parents still let me go.	5	5
What?	5	5
Didn't you hear about the sniper at the University of Texas today?	5	5
- Aren't you going to Ohio State? - It doesn't matter.	5	5
Just two weeks after those nurses in Chicago...	5	5
They don't want me out there by myself.	5	5
Don't let them scare you.	5	5
I don't know.	5	5
Things seem so random all of a sudden.	5	5
And time feels like it's speeding up.	5	5
It does.	5	5
Doesn't it?	5	5
I remember when the summer seemed as long as the school year.	5	5
I used to go every spring to the botanical gardens.	5	5
And this year, look, it's already August.	5	5
In the Bronx? My family donated some of that.	5	5
Really?	5	5
Well, generations ago.	5	5
We should go some Sunday soon.	5	5
We'd be VIPs.	5	5
Who's going to drive?	5	5
We'll take turns. Give each other lessons.	5	5
Okay, that's 15 minutes, everybody.	5	5
Back to the salt mines.	5	5
We should go back in.	5	5
Don't want to miss the mayhem.	5	5
What's Ken's wife's name?	5	5
I can't remember.	5	5
She sent me the nicest thank you card for the party.	5	5
Why don't you wear the sport coat I got you? It's the country.	5	5
You should slow down.	5	5
I'm timing this for when we arrive.	5	5
I want to hit the doorbell with my chin.	5	5
You know, this could be fun.	5	5
How's that work?	5	5
You don't think there's any chance you could have a conversation	5	5
with another couple as friends?	5	5
What about your actor friends?	5	5
I don't think there was any business	5	5
or financial realities discussed the whole time.	5	5
Don, I had to invite your accountant to your birthday party.	5	5
Frank's been very important to me, okay?	5	5
You're driving. Now go change.	5	5
Incredible, right?	5	5
We keep expecting to open the doors and see a tiny orchestra in there.	5	5
That would be amazing.	5	5
And it's a beautiful piece of furniture.	5	5
It's seven feet long.	5	5
Wilt Chamberlain could lie down in there.	5	5
Why would he want to do that?	5	5
The hostess would like you to turn down the stereo	5	5
for fear of waking a nonessential guest.	5	5
I told her she's not allowed to talk about the baby tonight.	5	5
Terrific. That's him.	5	5
- Welcome. - I'm sorry we're late.	5	5
You know I can't blame the directions.	5	5
- You have a lovely home. - You haven't seen it.	5	5
But it is certainly graced by the addition of the Cosgroves.	5	5
It's nice to see you, Don.	5	5
Well...	5	5
Hello, you.	5	5
I see a familiar red tin.	5	5
Brownies from William Greenberg.	5	5
Well, hello and welcome.	5	5
You look lovely, Trudy.	5	5
We did it, didn't we? We got them together.	5	5
Trudy, look what they brought. Doesn't it make you homesick?	5	5
I'm sorry there are no bakeries or Greenbergs in Cos Cob.	5	5
Can we put them in the icebox? Could everyone try it my way?	5	5
I'm going to devil some eggs if the girls want to help.	5	5
Megan, you want to take Don's drink order?	5	5
Big and brown.	5	5
Trudy, I love your touch.	5	5
It's almost rustic. Am I wrong?	5	5
That may take longer than you like.	5	5
Ken just handed it to me.	5	5
Do you like the music?	5	5
I do.	5	5
You know, I've never lived on the ground floor before.	5	5
And we don't share any walls, so I can make it as loud as I want.	5	5
But we're not gonna. Trudy has ground rules.	5	5
No work talk, no baby talk. And you get the big steak.	5	5
Excuse me?	5	5
Look,	5	5
I'm not gonna pretend it's not a big deal to us that you came out.	5	5
Oh, come on.	5	5
We're long overdue.	5	5
I remember asking you over to dinner when we first got married.	5	5
That was another lifetime.	5	5
Well, at least for me.	5	5
Mmm.	5	5
Beef's brilliant,	5	5
but it would be difficult to do those tomatoes one better.	5	5
Ever done any gardening?	5	5
No.	5	5
Well, I'm quite keen on it now.	5	5
Three years in North Africa, scarcely a blade of grass,	5	5
living like a dog.	5	5
Yes.	5	5
I've heard men talk with dark permanence about those years.	5	5
Not me. Best days of my life.	5	5
Oh, well.	5	5
Then I suppose you must miss it. You must have some melancholy.	5	5
No, it's just how I associate with my youth.	5	5
What about your war?	5	5
I volunteered for combat on numerous occasions,	5	5
but spent most of the war as a supply assistant in Rosyth.	5	5
Well, everyone played their part.	5	5
That was Britain at its best.	5	5
Yes.	5	5
So I'm glad to hear that America has been good for you.	5	5
And your wife is pleased, I assume?	5	5
I'll be honest with you, Lane.	5	5
I haven't a complaint in the world.	5	5
Well,	5	5
that's too bad, isn't it?	5	5
So the Coe family claims it was them. Coes' Cob.	5	5
Which became through Yankee arrogance Cos Cob.	5	5
Of course, it also sounds a lot like the Algonquin word for briefcase.	5	5
Ken, where have you and...	5	5
Where have you two made your home?	5	5
We're in Jackson Heights, Queens.	5	5
It's very down to earth. A lot of workers.	5	5
I keep telling them to move out to the country.	5	5
We both work in the city and my parents aren't like Trudy's.	5	5
Help from them comes with a lot of strings attached.	5	5
It is beautiful out here.	5	5
The air is so fresh and all the trees and the grass.	5	5
I grew up in rural Vermont.	5	5
Kids throwing their bikes on the front lawn is not the country to me.	5	5
You miss the horseshit, huh?	5	5
Don!	5	5
I grew up in the country, too, and I don't miss walking to an outhouse	5	5
in the middle of winter.	5	5
Well, it's more civilized than that.	5	5
But there are a lot of varmints.	5	5
You should bring that rifle home.	5	5
You still have that? There will be no gun in this house.	5	5
I never liked them. And now with that Charles Whitmore.	5	5
Whitman.	5	5
They say he had a brain tumor. He kept warning everyone.	5	5
Without a gun, would he be able to kill his wife and mom and 20 other people?	5	5
I'm sorry. It's the hostess' prerogative to change the subject.	5	5
Trudy, it bears discussion.	5	5
One rifle for shooting gophers is not the same	5	5
as a frustrated ex-Marine shooting at pregnant ladies.	5	5
You know, Kenny predicted it. He wrote a story that was exactly like that.	5	5
- Don't, Cynthia. - Cynthia!	5	5
What?	5	5
Nothing, I just...	5	5
- Honey, they don't want to talk about that. - Why not?	5	5
You know, if he wasn't a writer, we never would have met.	5	5
- I didn't know that. - I work in publishing.	5	5
My boss was rejecting him and I thought it was all he could handle.	5	5
What was the story?	5	5
- Forget it. - No, we want to know.	5	5
It's called The Punishment of X4.	5	5
There's this bridge between these two planets	5	5
and thousands of humans travel on it every day.	5	5
And so there's this robot, he does maintenance on the bridge.	5	5
And one day, he removes a bolt and the bridge collapses and everyone dies.	5	5
There's more to it than that, you know.	5	5
But it's just a story.	5	5
Why does he do it?	5	5
Because he's a robot.	5	5
Those people tell him what to do	5	5
and he doesn't have the power to make any decisions	5	5
except he can decide whether that bolt's on or off.	5	5
Or he just hates commuters.	5	5
How long have you been writing?	5	5
I started screwing around in high school.	5	5
And by the time I got a job, I thought it would go away.	5	5
And it mostly has.	5	5
No one grows up wanting to be in advertising.	5	5
That's not true. It's such an interesting profession to me.	5	5
What drew you to it, Megan?	5	5
Megan came to New York as an actress.	5	5
If trying to be an actress is being an actress.	5	5
That's fascinating. I could see it.	5	5
But I had been in a few agencies on auditions	5	5
and it looked like a fun place to get the bills paid.	5	5
And I saw what Don and Peggy did and I saw a future for myself in it.	5	5
That's the truth.	5	5
Can I interest anyone in dessert and coffee? Hot or iced?	5	5
Yes to dessert. Still having too much fun for coffee.	5	5
People talk about how there's so much crime in the city.	5	5
I was ripped off by the kid who mows my lawn.	5	5
Yeah, they used to take my beer out of the fridge in the garage.	5	5
A fridge in the garage? That's a good idea.	5	5
Damn it. I'll get the toolbox.	5	5
I turned it on and it just blew in my face.	5	5
Hold this.	5	5
Don, what are you doing?	5	5
Look, it's Superman.	5	5
Oh, good Lord.	5	5
What was wrong?	5	5
The supply was turned all the way up. It forces the valve.	5	5
- But it stopped the leak. - That was a coincidence.	5	5
Grab Don's shirt. I'll throw it in the dryer.	5	5
Aren't we supposed to say something about that baby?	5	5
- Look at her. - What an angel.	5	5
I take no credit for her at all.	5	5
Aw!	5	5
I'm gonna close my eyes and when I open them,	5	5
I want to see skyscrapers.	5	5
Admit it, you had a great time.	5	5
I'm too drunk for you to drive.	5	5
We should pull over and both sober up.	5	5
Let's make a baby.	5	5
No, that's impossible.	5	5
What, isn't that how this works?	5	5
A baby gets you going?	5	5
Just pull over. This brassiere is like Fort Knox.	5	5
The only reason you're getting anywhere	5	5
is because Pete scared the shit out of me with his car accident statistics	5	5
and because I can't believe how much I loved watching you fix that sink.	5	5
Because there was a plane crash.	5	5
And it doesn't matter that it's not one of Mohawk's.	5	5
We should stop running ads for a week and then just hope that no one notices	5	5
that Mohawk has 10 planes that are the same model.	5	5
Why? There's a plane crash every day in Vietnam.	5	5
There were seven yesterday. It's Braniff, for Christ's sake.	5	5
Let them eat their award-winning work.	5	5
- Ask Lane. - Yes?	5	5
Do what you want. It's your account.	5	5
Hey, Heathcliff. How was your date?	5	5
Lane here got Lord Jaguar to unravel the mysteries of the RFP.	5	5
Yes, about that...	5	5
Unfortunately, I was forced to do the plan in reverse,	5	5
as you suggested.	5	5
I even offered that Rebecca was unbalanced	5	5
in an effort to attempt to lull him into confession,	5	5
but to no avail.	5	5
Oh.	5	5
What plan?	5	5
Anyway, I've primed him for another dinner	5	5
when all shall be revealed and it's on the books.	5	5
That's not what I told you to do.	5	5
Lane, I think Roger and I, and probably Don,	5	5
should take your friend out to a dinner which is strictly business.	5	5
Ask all the rough questions, brag about you, then allow you to swoop in,	5	5
his new best friend, and shine the chrome.	5	5
I don't know if that's necessary.	5	5
Roger, tell him that's the way the plan always works.	5	5
Sure.	5	5
You wouldn't want to hit a golf ball off the tee	5	5
when you could hit it from the green.	5	5
We need you to stay a pure friend. Practice your putting.	5	5
Very well, then.	5	5
That was generous.	5	5
Come on, Lane couldn't close a car door.	5	5
I mean inviting me along.	5	5
I'm inviting you to dinner, not the wedding night.	5	5
How are you?	5	5
I think I'm hung-over.	5	5
What? Really?	5	5
Belinda and I were left alone in the drugstore	5	5
and she opened up a bottle of vanilla extract.	5	5
It did make the afternoon go faster, but now I have a headache.	5	5
Sounds like my office.	5	5
Well...	5	5
Now that you're sober,	5	5
I will remind you that you promised to find a Sunday for the gardens.	5	5
What about church?	5	5
God's all over the gardens.	5	5
- Hi. - Hey.	5	5
I missed a couple classes, but I'm here from now on.	5	5
No, he's not the instructor. He's Peter.	5	5
- Who are you? - I'm Jenny Gunther.	5	5
- Chemistry. - Right.	5	5
You're Handsome, aren't you?	5	5
- Yeah. - I'm sorry.	5	5
Your name is Handsome?	5	5
No, my name is Hanson, but everybody calls me that.	5	5
So I got to be some kind of weirdo that I don't remember you.	5	5
It was a big class.	5	5
There were a lot of girls.	5	5
- So what are you doing next year? - Ohio State.	5	5
Billy Josephs and I were supposed to join up, but my dad went ape.	5	5
He wouldn't let me drive, either.	5	5
So I'm gonna follow through on that track scholarship to Holy Cross.	5	5
I think a man getting out of a Jaguar needs a cold shower.	5	5
That's it, a singular message repeated over and over again.	5	5
The Jaguar XKE is pornographic.	5	5
Is that enough of a flavor?	5	5
Gentlemen,	5	5
not that I don't appreciate the all-hands-on-deck,	5	5
but I think the cause of our friendship	5	5
would be best served by us having a little fun.	5	5
Oh.	5	5
Fun.	5	5
Well, you know that I have every intention of giving you this business.	5	5
I just want to make sure that I enjoy the people I work with.	5	5
We'd love to show you a good time.	5	5
I'm surprised Lane didn't offer.	5	5
I don't think Mr. Pryce and I have the same taste in this area.	5	5
We should go grab a drink at the Carlyle. It's a good place to get into trouble.	5	5
You understand I'm not visiting. I reside here in New York.	5	5
Roger, I believe this is your opportunity to shine.	5	5
You know what?	5	5
I have a friend who's having a party right around the corner.	5	5
Oh.	5	5
I like parties.	5	5
I said we're from out of town.	5	5
Now give me one attraction that isn't in this room right in front of me.	5	5
What happened to your friend?	5	5
Because the last word I want to hear out of his date's mouth is next.	5	5
Anastasia, he likes you.	5	5
Listen, honey.	5	5
I'm not gonna bore you with compliments.	5	5
What about your friend?	5	5
Jesus, Don, even in this place you're doing better than us.	5	5
Oh, someone got lucky.	5	5
I think one of your sorority sisters isn't very picky.	5	5
Come on, Don. Work, work, work.	5	5
Do you think you could lift me?	5	5
That's what I thought.	5	5
You're one of those guys who's stronger than he looks.	5	5
I want some rum, but I think it's in my room.	5	5
Easy, tiger. I don't do this by the minute.	5	5
You think this is gonna be easy?	5	5
I do.	5	5
I really do.	5	5
You any good at this or not?	5	5
Oh.	5	5
Honey.	5	5
You've had such a hard day.	5	5
Nope.	5	5
Um...	5	5
It's my first time.	5	5
I'm kind of nervous.	5	5
Nope.	5	5
You're my king.	5	5
Okay.	5	5
I suppose you know that Officer Logan says to say hello.	5	5
I'm not a cop.	5	5
Are you interested in someone who's already busy?	5	5
Just waiting for my friends.	5	5
Well, if there's something you can't find here,	5	5
a friend of mine has an apartment.	5	5
Maybe more what you're looking for and he's walking distance.	5	5
That's the best I've ever seen that done.	5	5
Does that happen to you a lot?	5	5
No. I grew up in a place like this.	5	5
There's no other place like this.	5	5
You're right. It wasn't as nice.	5	5
We called it a whorehouse.	5	5
Oh.	5	5
I see.	5	5
So, expert, what do you think?	5	5
Should I get a TV in here?	5	5
No.	5	5
Jessica, I've got his drinks.	5	5
Well, gentlemen, I asked for fun and I got it.	5	5
Unless you're going to give me a pen that says Jaguar on it,	5	5
you should be reaching for your house keys.	5	5
Good night.	5	5
Two more stops. First one is the near corner of 72nd.	5	5
That went very well.	5	5
He seemed happy.	5	5
I'm sorry you weren't feeling well.	5	5
I'm feeling fine.	5	5
So why do I feel like I'm riding with a nun?	5	5
I didn't say anything.	5	5
I mean, you of all people.	5	5
You're right.	5	5
- Well, have a good night. - I already did.	5	5
Good.	5	5
Boy, this is rich.	5	5
I can't believe I have to explain I was doing my job	5	5
to a man who just pulled his pants up on the world.	5	5
Pete, just go home, take a shower, and forget this.	5	5
I suppose there are no stern looks for Roger.	5	5
Roger is miserable. I didn't think you were.	5	5
I have it all.	5	5
Wait till your honeymoon is over.	5	5
Look, I'm just trying to tell you because I am who I am	5	5
and I've been where I've been that you don't get another chance at what you have.	5	5
Brave words for a man on his second time round.	5	5
Yeah, and if I had met her first, I would have known not to throw it away.	5	5
Now I need you to take me to Cos Cob.	5	5
You got to pay both ways.	5	5
I'm aware of that.	5	5
You wanted to see me?	5	5
Yes, come in.	5	5
So, a little birdy told me you've been hard at work	5	5
writing stories.	5	5
Oh.	5	5
Who'd have thunk you were you by day and Edgar Allan Poe by night?	5	5
It's nothing. I only do it because my wife likes it.	5	5
My wife likes fur, but you don't see me growing a tail.	5	5
Time for the partners' meeting.	5	5
Coming!	5	5
You know, as an account man, you already have a day job. And a night job.	5	5
And I love it.	5	5
You knew to keep it a secret because your attentions are divided.	5	5
I like to think we offer you more than security here.	5	5
I understand.	5	5
Good.	5	5
And as a fellow unappreciated author and a friend,	5	5
let me tell you, when this job is good, it satisfies every need.	5	5
Believe me, I remember.	5	5
Mrs. Pryce is on the phone.	5	5
I'm late for the partners' meeting.	5	5
What?	5	5
Calm yourself.	5	5
Believe me, Nixon's lying in wait.	5	5
So, I see everyone's here.	5	5
Johnson will stop the war before the election.	5	5
You don't stop a war before an election.	5	5
Mrs. Harris, please excuse us.	5	5
Immediately!	5	5
Your activities last night have cost us this account.	5	5
What?	5	5
Go ahead, tell him how you corrupted my account and my friend.	5	5
Hold on. What happened?	5	5
Edwin's wife, her life destroyed, called my wife with gory details.	5	5
Why would he say anything?	5	5
Because he was caught with chewing gum on his pubis.	5	5
How dare you laugh at this?	5	5
What, did she just put it there and forget about it?	5	5
It was Edwin's idea.	5	5
Impossible. He would never.	5	5
He didn't ask you because he thinks you're a homo.	5	5
I can't believe the hours I've put into	5	5
helping you become the monster you've become.	5	5
I was doing my job.	5	5
It was my account!	5	5
Your account?	5	5
You have no idea what you're doing.	5	5
In fact, as far as I can tell,	5	5
our need for you disappeared the day after you fired us.	5	5
Mr. Campbell.	5	5
That'll be enough of that.	5	5
Mr. Campbell, you and I are going to address that insult.	5	5
- Are you kidding me? - No.	5	5
You're a grimy little pimp.	5	5
As soon as I raise my hands, I warn you, it shall be too late to run.	5	5
Fine.	5	5
You want to take your teeth out? Or do you want me to knock them out?	5	5
I know cooler heads should prevail, but am I the only one who wants to see this?	5	5
Come on.	5	5
Let's go.	5	5
This is medieval.	5	5
Hi, I'm sorry...	5	5
- You little devil. - Lane and Pete are fighting.	5	5
You want some more, Mr. Toad?	5	5
- You all right? - I'm fine. I'm fine.	5	5
Consider that my last piece of advice.	5	5
You'll be fine.	5	5
I don't know about you two, but I had Lane.	5	5
Reschedule the meeting.	5	5
I'm busy.	5	5
It's Joan.	5	5
What happened?	5	5
What do I do here?	5	5
I mean,	5	5
truly?	5	5
Something essential.	5	5
You could do it.	5	5
If they've tried to make you feel you're different than them, you are.	5	5
That's a good way to be.	5	5
I just seem to find no end to my humiliation today.	5	5
- I'm sorry. - About what?	5	5
Everyone in this office has wanted to do that to Pete Campbell.	5	5
Did you hear? Lane kicked the crap out of Pete.	5	5
- I can't believe he beat me to it. - What did Pete do?	5	5
I don't know, but I know he told Roger about my writing.	5	5
- Why did you tell him? - Cynthia let it slip.	5	5
Hell, she bragged about it.	5	5
You can't blame her.	5	5
I read the one in Galaxy about the girl who lays eggs. Wow!	5	5
Well, thanks.	5	5
But Ben Hargrove is dead.	5	5
I'm through with all that fantasy stuff.	5	5
Oh.	5	5
- I'm sorry. - I'm gonna leave the writing to the writers.	5	5
Come on.	5	5
- Where are you headed? - I'm meeting Megan for lunch.	5	5
I'm not as virtuous as you,	5	5
so you just cut me loose?	5	5
What was I supposed to do? Step in? Punch Lane?	5	5
Why were we even having a fight at work?	5	5
This is an office.	5	5
We're supposed to be friends.	5	5
I have nothing, Don.	5	5
"""The Man with the Miniature Orchestra"", by Dave Algonquin."	5	5
"""There were phrases of Beethoven's 9th Symphony"""	5	5
"""that still made Coe cry."""	5	5
"""He always thought it had to do with the circumstances of the composition itself."""	5	5
"""He imagined Beethoven, deaf and soul-sick, his heart broken,"""	5	5
"""scribbling furiously while death stood in the doorway clipping his nails."""	5	5
"""Still, Coe thought,"""	5	5
"""it might have been living in the country that was making him cry."""	5	5
"""it was killing him with its silence and loneliness."""	5	5
"""Making everything ordinary,"""	5	5
"""too beautiful to bear."""	5	5
Did you eat my pack of violet candy?	5	6
What?	5	6
It's purple and silver.	5	6
Don gave it to me before a presentation once.	5	6
- No. - I need it.	5	6
- So you'll buy another one. - That's not the same.	5	6
Don't be such a strict Catholic.	5	6
I'll buy one for you and I'll say a brucha.	5	6
How about tonight we go see that stupid movie	5	6
about the guy being hunted in Africa?	5	6
- The Naked Prey. - I don't know, Abe.	5	6
 You're gonna resist the chance to see Cornel Wilde naked?	5	6
I heard he wrestles a boa constrictor. Sounds pretty dirty.	5	6
I can't think beyond my presentation.	5	6
There's always special circumstances.	5	6
That's not true.	5	6
I've been working on Heinz for months.	5	6
You know what you want? You want to take me to work with you,	5	6
and stick me in a drawer and open it whenever you get bored.	5	6
Fine. You don't want to see each other anymore?	5	6
Jesus!	5	6
You always want to push the button on the whole thing.	5	6
I come all the way up here to make love.	5	6
Half the time, you don't want to and then you just do it to get it over with.	5	6
It's just hard when I come right from work.	5	6
 I need a second when I walk in the door.	5	6
- You sound like my dad. - Fine.	5	6
We'll go to the movies. I just can't promise that my mind won't be elsewhere.	5	6
Your mind is always elsewhere.	5	6
Why are you doing this right now?	5	6
Most men wouldn't even have this conversation. They'd just leave.	5	6
And why would they do that?	5	6
I'm your boyfriend, not a focus group.	5	6
Have a shitty day.	5	6
I don't know. Can't you make it till Friday?	5	6
Because today is not a good day.	5	6
This conversation went in a circle and we're back where we started.	5	6
The answer is no.	5	6
Yeah, me, too.	5	6
I just had the same conversation.	5	6
No, I think they were different because yours was private.	5	6
Sorry I'm late.	5	6
There's no place to pee in this city.	5	6
- She just got here. - Then why are you giving me a hard time?	5	6
We had the funniest thing outside our building.	5	6
A bunch of students with backpacks asked us how to get to Broadway.	5	6
What's so funny about that, Jethro?	5	6
It's like the campaign. We could have cast it right there and then.	5	6
- Megan, can I have a moment? - Sure.	5	6
- She goes to casting now? - I guess so.	5	6
She's kind of been my junior on this.	5	6
I was buying dinner last night for this large-breasted girl	5	6
who calls herself Salome, and she's looking at the menu,	5	6
ridiculing this Grandma Moses drawing and she's balls-out funny.	5	6
But I ignore her because all I can think of	5	6
is I'll never be able to draw as well as a photograph.	5	6
Oh, thank God.	5	6
I couldn't take one more omen of doom.	5	6
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to miss the presentation.	5	6
We have to head upstate for Howard Johnson's.	5	6
- Really? - You're running the show.	5	6
How does me sitting there change anything?	5	6
Howard Johnson's, huh?	5	6
I love the colors, the atmosphere,	5	6
- the clams. - She's never been to one.	5	6
I'm really sorry.	5	6
No, we have all your work, I guess.	5	6
I'll check in from the road. Get your stuff.	5	6
Break a leg.	5	6
- Well, that's a disaster. - Don't listen to him.	5	6
That's a vote of confidence.	5	6
Give me one of those.	5	6
The fire is primal.	5	6
These kids, they all come there alone,	5	6
and gathered in a circle, they suddenly feel included.	5	6
They're safe from whatever is out there in the night, in the darkness.	5	6
It's the beans that brought them together on that cool night at the end of the summer.	5	6
I wish someone was eating beans.	5	6
That guy is.	5	6
I did ask for college students.	5	6
I know that, Raymond.	5	6
And we want you to have everything you asked for.	5	6
Well, stop writing down what I asked for and try to figure out what I want.	5	6
Raymond, I saw you when she was talking.	5	6
- You were off somewhere. - It's very sentimental.	5	6
I have that memory.	5	6
That's for me. That's not for kids.	5	6
Kids have memories.	5	6
And so do the homemakers who make a home with Heinz.	5	6
Raymond, can you see how passionate she is?	5	6
Photography will really capture the fun on their faces. And the glow.	5	6
Did Don sign off on this?	5	6
Don loves this work.	5	6
Maybe Don doesn't understand what you wanted either.	5	6
Let's not speak for Don.	5	6
I'm sorry. I'm not a word person like you people.	5	6
Sure, you are.	5	6
"And your words are always, ""I don't like it."""	5	6
And I think you're right. We don't understand you.	5	6
Because you do like it.	5	6
I think you just like fighting.	5	6
Peggy, you're being oversensitive.	5	6
Do you know how often people come in here and look at work and feel something?	5	6
Almost never.	5	6
You have to run with this.	5	6
It's young and it's beautiful.	5	6
And no one else is gonna figure out how to say that about beans.	5	6
Can you believe this girl?	5	6
I don't know. Can you?	5	6
Miss, you're lucky that I have a daughter or I wouldn't be so understanding.	5	6
Raymond, they're frustrated, but they're not through.	5	6
I'm frustrated, too.	5	6
- It's close, I guess. - It's damn close.	5	6
Why don't just you and I have dinner tonight?	5	6
Maybe take in a show? Take your mind off things?	5	6
You can try.	5	6
I've got to admire you.	5	6
That was a completely suicidal move.	5	6
Women usually want to please.	5	6
Give me sketches of the talking beans.	5	6
I'll write new dialog.	5	6
- You're off the business. - What'd he say?	5	6
He said you're off the business.	5	6
Everyone has somewhere to go today.	5	6
I'm going to the movies.	5	6
Very good.	5	6
One of them gave Sam a first-class scratch.	5	6
Not very good-tempered, are they?	5	6
Well, neither are you when you're hungry.	5	6
I don't suppose you've fed them.	5	6
No, I can't say I have.	5	6
You didn't pack any lion's milk for me before I left.	5	6
You didn't ask me.	5	6
You're going to get in trouble.	5	6
Want some?	5	6
Sure. What the hell.	5	6
Come on.	5	6
- Hello. - Hi.	5	6
But why don't they?	5	6
It's at least two days since they've eaten.	5	6
- They'll just die. - Yes, I know.	5	6
It must be the formula. We haven't hit on it yet.	5	6
We'll just have to try again.	5	6
Right, back to the drawing board.	5	6
- Formula... - Thirteen.	5	6
Oh, George, I've just been thinking about the cod-liver oil.	5	6
She's not gonna make it out there on her own.	5	6
You've got to keep it down.	5	6
Okay.	5	6
Aren't you worried?	5	6
It'll turn out all right.	5	6
That evening, we suffered all the agony of parents	5	6
whose teenage daughter is out on her first date.	5	6
No.	5	6
Just watch the movie.	5	6
We returned the next day only to find Elsa	5	6
minus both the young lion and her food.	5	6
I told you a dozen sometimes I was coming in.	5	6
And I said no, you're not coming in.	5	6
'Cause you don't want I should see you?	5	6
You see me at home, for Christ's sake.	5	6
You stare at me when I'm sleeping.	5	6
I don't want to see you anyway.	5	6
- I just want to use the photocopy. - For what?	5	6
I'm building my case.	5	6
Again?	5	6
Who's this?	5	6
I'm Peggy Olson. I work with Ginsberg.	5	6
Well, I'm the original.	5	6
Okay. It's bedtime.	5	6
Miss Olson.	5	6
- What time is it? - It's 8:30.	5	6
Mr. Draper's on the phone.	5	6
I'll take it in here. You can go.	5	6
Good night.	5	6
- Hello? - Dawn didn't get any calls.	5	6
Did you get any calls?	5	6
- About what? - Has anyone called you?	5	6
I don't think so.	5	6
Okay.	5	6
Listen, it didn't go well.	5	6
- I've got to go. - I take full responsibility.	5	6
Hello?	5	6
Why didn't you tell me you had a family?	5	6
- Your father's nice. - He's not my real father.	5	6
People don't understand.	5	6
- Are you adopted? - Actually, I'm from Mars.	5	6
It's fine if you don't believe me, but that's where I'm from.	5	6
I'm a full-blooded Martian.	5	6
Don't worry. There's no plot to take over Earth.	5	6
We're just displaced.	5	6
Okay.	5	6
I can tell you don't believe me.	5	6
That's okay. We're a big secret.	5	6
They even tried to hide it from me.	5	6
That man, my father,	5	6
told me a story I was born in a concentration camp,	5	6
but, you know, that's impossible.	5	6
And I never met my mother because she supposedly died there.	5	6
That's convenient.	5	6
Next thing I know, Morris there finds me in a Swedish orphanage.	5	6
I was five. I remember it.	5	6
That's incredible.	5	6
Yeah.	5	6
And then I got this one communication.	5	6
A simple order.	5	6
"""Stay where you are."""	5	6
Are there others like you?	5	6
I don't know.	5	6
I haven't been able to find any.	5	6
- Hello? - Hi. It's me.	5	6
You at work?	5	6
No, I'm home.	5	6
Come up here.	5	6
You need me, huh?	5	6
I always need you.	5	6
What happened?	5	6
This guy told me the strangest thing at work today.	5	6
Yeah?	5	6
He said he was born in a concentration camp.	5	6
But that's impossible, right?	5	6
It happened.	5	6
- Come up here. - Okay.	5	6
Hurry.	5	6
I'm going to go in there and sit down with the door closed.	5	6
And I want you to buzz me when he comes in.	5	6
One buzz for Don, two buzzes for Mr. and Mrs.	5	6
- Who died? - Let's play hooky.	5	6
Should I close the door?	5	6
Remember when we used to represent double-sided aluminum?	5	6
I remember twins and a hospital.	5	6
Not that part.	5	6
Bob Whozit's moved over to Howard Johnson's	5	6
to help them with their new models.	5	6
So how about a completely debauched and unnecessary fact-finding boondoggle	5	6
to the flagship in	5	6
Plattsburgh, New York?	5	6
Just an hour from scenic Lake Placid.	5	6
Are you kidding me?	5	6
Did you ever hear the one about the farmer's daughter?	5	6
This is where it all takes place.	5	6
- No. - Don, come on.	5	6
Alone, I'm an escapee from some expensive mental institution.	5	6
But the two of us, we're a couple of rich, handsome perverts.	5	6
- I love Howard Johnson's. - We'll try and stop by.	5	6
I think Montreal is an hour away.	5	6
Look, the whole point of going is to forget about her.	5	6
I mean, I'm supposed to have dinner with Jane's snooty friends,	5	6
sit around talking about Frank Lloyd Rice.	5	6
I always say it that way. They hate it.	5	6
You know what?	5	6
- I'm gonna take Megan. - Really?	5	6
You can bring Jane.	5	6
Megan gets along with everyone.	5	6
You're very funny. Forget it.	5	6
Newlyweds.	5	6
I'll give Dawn the guy's name.	5	6
Dawn, I need you to get me out of everything through the weekend.	5	6
It was a dumb idea.	5	6
- Megan, can I have a moment? - Sure.	5	6
- You're not gonna say anything? - What?	5	6
I said you look nice, and I said I don't want to do this.	5	6
Well, what do you want to do?	5	6
Go home, open your vest and yell at the TV for the next 20 years? Go ahead.	5	6
God! Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know these people.	5	6
I do.	5	6
And it's not about them.	5	6
It's very important to me. I don't know how many ways to say it.	5	6
I should have worn something more comfortable.	5	6
You really do look great.	5	6
It's the study of the ways that things are true or false.	5	6
Some things are possibly true. Some are necessarily true.	5	6
Some used to be true. Some will be true.	5	6
Some are true on this planet, but not necessarily others.	5	6
So there's no good and bad because the truth is relative?	5	6
Even if the truth is what you would call relative,	5	6
good and bad are not relative.	5	6
Your mistake is that you're assuming	5	6
that because something is true, that it's good.	5	6
Professor's got you there.	5	6
I think the truth is good because it's always real	5	6
on any planet.	5	6
I have patients who spend years reasoning out their motivation for a mistake.	5	6
And when they find it out, they think they've found the truth.	5	6
They probably have.	5	6
And then they go and make the same mistake.	5	6
Like who?	5	6
Catherine has been the psychiatrist to some celebrities.	5	6
So they never get better?	5	6
I didn't say that. I just said that it's a myth	5	6
that tracing logic all the way down to the truth	5	6
is a cure for neurosis or for anything else.	5	6
Is there a cure for neurosis?	5	6
Love works.	5	6
I say we postpone this conversation until after we turn on.	5	6
- Shall we? - Or after we turn in.	5	6
Jane, honey, you ready?	5	6
What do you think you're doing?	5	6
I took your college course. I say it's time to hit the sack.	5	6
- No, we're gonna do this. - Do what?	5	6
I told you, we're going to take L.S.D. with them.	5	6
You were supposed to clear your schedule.	5	6
L.S.D.? Really?	5	6
You really are never listening, are you?	5	6
- How long does it last? - Please.	5	6
I don't want to do this alone.	5	6
It'll be good for us.	5	6
Okay.	5	6
Just copy what they're doing.	5	6
I think we are going to go.	5	6
- No. - We had a lovely time.	5	6
No one has to stay.	5	6
AII I'll say is that I have taken it now four times	5	6
and every experience was more beautiful than the last.	5	6
And I'm not gonna take it. I'll be here to guide you.	5	6
I'm excited.	5	6
I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous.	5	6
This is an experience of self-fulfilling prophecy.	5	6
You have to enter into it with a spirit of optimism.	5	6
It's like a boat trip. You don't cast off thinking about sinking.	5	6
And this boat is perfect. And the water is calm.	5	6
No, you hold on to that.	5	6
Go ahead.	5	6
Just let it melt on your tongue.	5	6
You always say I never take you anywhere.	5	6
Well, Dr. Leary, I find your product boring.	5	6
Only awareness can make reality.	5	6
And only what's real can become a dream.	5	6
And only from a dream can you wake to the light.	5	6
Okey-dokey.	5	6
He's not making this up.	5	6
It's from The Tibetan Book of the Damned.	5	6
"The ""dead,"" my dear. Bardo Thodol is a guide to dying."	5	6
Oh, my God!	5	6
Look at my arm.	5	6
I don't want to die.	5	6
Some party.	5	6
AII absence is death if we let ourselves know it.	5	6
Weren't you the one who said we were supposed to think positive?	5	6
Yes.	5	6
I feel like that when Roger goes to work.	5	6
A mere change is incremental and shallow.	5	6
I'm sitting here listening to these people have a conversation.	5	6
It has nothing to do with me.	5	6
It's incredible.	5	6
Don't look in the mirror.	5	6
What?	5	6
Don't look in the mirror.	5	6
- Why didn't you tell me that? - I did.	5	6
I already looked.	5	6
Look at me. Everything's okay.	5	6
You are okay.	5	6
Now go to your wife.	5	6
Why?	5	6
Because she wants to be alone in the truth with you.	5	6
Just go already.	5	6
You're crying.	5	6
It's so...	5	6
It's perfect here.	5	6
Let's go home.	5	6
Why are you laughing?	5	6
Are you laughing at me?	5	6
What's wrong with me?	5	6
It's the World Series.	5	6
1919. The Black Sox.	5	6
Were you there?	5	6
No, but I'm there.	5	6
Look at the cars. Model T, Model T, Model A, Model T.	5	6
I can't see it.	5	6
What time is it?	5	6
How could a few numbers contain all of time?	5	6
I can feel your lips.	5	6
- I'm still here. - I can see you.	5	6
- You're beautiful. - You always say that.	5	6
It's all you ever say.	5	6
Now I know why your friends are so smart.	5	6
Catherine is not my friend. She's my doctor.	5	6
I knew that, but I didn't know it.	5	6
Sometimes I think she knows me better than you do.	5	6
Do I want to know?	5	6
Probably not.	5	6
Because it's over?	5	6
She's just waiting for me to say it.	5	6
And what does she think of me?	5	6
She thinks I'm waiting for you to say it.	5	6
But instead, you wrote me this poem tonight, didn't you?	5	6
I knew we were going somewhere, and I didn't want it to be here.	5	6
Do you feel as relieved as I do?	5	6
AII I think about is having an affair.	5	6
I see them everywhere.	5	6
You never cheated on me?	5	6
There was a kiss.	5	6
I stopped it.	5	6
And then I was mad at you,	5	6
that you didn't appreciate it	5	6
even though you didn't know about it.	5	6
A younger man?	5	6
No, Roger.	5	6
That's always been real.	5	6
And I won't even ask about you.	5	6
I just know for a fact that you did not fall in love.	5	6
So what was wrong again?	5	6
You don't like me.	5	6
I did.	5	6
I really did.	5	6
- Is it morning? - Yes.	5	6
I'm sorry I always say it, but you are so beautiful.	5	6
Last night was beautiful.	5	6
It was, wasn't it?	5	6
Where are you going?	5	6
Out the door	5	6
and into the elevator, I suppose.	5	6
What about me?	5	6
You can take your time, obviously.	5	6
I figured I'd just check into a hotel for a while.	5	6
I don't want to displace you.	5	6
What are you talking about?	5	6
I imagined all the screaming and fighting and lawyers.	5	6
It's just so beautiful	5	6
how we were able to be there together	5	6
in the truth, like you wanted.	5	6
- Are you leaving me? - No.	5	6
We're leaving each otherjust like you said.	5	6
- I didn't say that. - You did.	5	6
You said so many amazing things.	5	6
- You were speaking German. - I don't know German.	5	6
You were quoting your father.	5	6
It must have been Yiddish.	5	6
But I was on drugs. I obviously didn't mean any of it.	5	6
So your psychiatrist didn't tell you	5	6
that you knew this was over, but you were waiting for me to say it?	5	6
I did say that.	5	6
It's good that you did because we both knew it.	5	6
No.	5	6
I don't know.	5	6
It's going to be very expensive.	5	6
I know.	5	6
Dawn, I need you to get me out of everything through the weekend.	5	6
It was a dumb idea.	5	6
- Megan, can I have a moment? - Sure.	5	6
Listen, there's a Howard Johnson's upstate, they want us to visit immediately.	5	6
I thought we'd go and make a long weekend of it.	5	6
- What about Heinz? - What about it?	5	6
It'll be fine. Remember California?	5	6
- Two hotel rooms. - Of course.	5	6
- But we can go tomorrow. - Come on.	5	6
Let's go right now. We can do this.	5	6
I don't know.	5	6
I'm the boss. I'm ordering you. Come on.	5	6
You know, it's like an hour and a half from my parents.	5	6
They're coming to visit soon.	5	6
I know. You're right.	5	6
And we don't have to work much tonight.	5	6
Someone named Dale is going to give us the royal treatment.	5	6
You like orange sherbet?	5	6
- I don't know. - You've never had it?	5	6
- You are in for a treat. - Sounds great.	5	6
Everything okay?	5	6
I'm just tired.	5	6
So take a nap. Relax.	5	6
When you wake up, you will feel like you're on vacation.	5	6
You know what? Tell me more about what we're going to be doing	5	6
in Howard Johnson's so I can get some sleep.	5	6
Could you open your window?	5	6
I wonder how Heinz went. Peggy seemed nervous.	5	6
Peggy knows what she's doing.	5	6
What are you worrying about that for?	5	6
I feel like I abandoned the team.	5	6
You feel bad because you got to take off and they had to work?	5	6
I don't.	5	6
There has to be some advantage to being my wife.	5	6
I'll check in with Peggy later.	5	6
Okay.	5	6
They got an indoor pool.	5	6
Did you bring that suit from Acapulco?	5	6
I forgot. I was rushing.	5	6
We'll get you a new one after we check in. I brought mine.	5	6
- Mr. Draper? - It's Don.	5	6
Pleased to meet you. This is my wife, Megan.	5	6
Dale Vanderwort.	5	6
A little more notice, I would have rolled out the orange carpet.	5	6
I've got your room all set for you.	5	6
Actually, I'd like something to eat and something to drink.	5	6
Sure, I'm going to bring you a sampling of everything.	5	6
- Do you like clams? - I like everything.	5	6
I got you something.	5	6
I got one for Bobby, and I got a box of saltwater taffy for Sally.	5	6
What did you get for Gene?	5	6
Sally will share and she'll make Bobby share.	5	6
I was the youngest, Don. You can't forget about him.	5	6
Trust me, he won't know the difference.	5	6
Didn't make much of a dent. Anything to your liking?	5	6
- We had a little of everything. - Should I bring some desserts?	5	6
Yes, how about some pie?	5	6
No, you know what? Just three scoops of orange sherbet and two spoons.	5	6
The colors are bright and cheerful.	5	6
The kids have candy. Full bar for Mom and Dad.	5	6
Would you say it's a delightful destination?	5	6
It's not a destination.	5	6
It's on the way to someplace.	5	6
That's true. It's a long car drive.	5	6
Mom probably needs to use the restroom.	5	6
Kids get a look at the place,	5	6
force them to stay.	5	6
You like to work, but I can't like to work?	5	6
You should have told me if it was so important to you.	5	6
- We didn't have to go. - I never got the chance.	5	6
It was in front of everyone. And it's embarrassing.	5	6
I ruined the whole damn thing by pulling you off that crack team.	5	6
I am on the team.	5	6
- Here we go. - She's never tried it.	5	6
- You're kidding. - Try it.	5	6
Oh, no, sorry.	5	6
- It's not for everybody. - It tastes like perfume to me.	5	6
That's why we make 28 flavors.	5	6
Can I get a scoop of chocolate?	5	6
Really?	5	6
I don't like it.	5	6
There's no chance you're trying to embarrass me?	5	6
You're right. I'm sorry.	5	6
It's so delicious.	5	6
It's so good.	5	6
Stop it.	5	6
What's wrong with you?	5	6
I'm sorry. Maybe you could make up a little schedule	5	6
so I'll know when I'm working and when I'm your wife.	5	6
It gets so confusing.	5	6
I know, I'm terrible. Making you eat ice cream.	5	6
Why don't you call your mother	5	6
and hurl a string of complaints at her in French like you always do?	5	6
- I'm always talking about you. - The woman speaks English.	5	6
Why don't you call your mother?	5	6
Don.	5	6
Do not walk away from me.	5	6
- Get in the car. - No, I am talking to you.	5	6
Okay, don't get in the car.	5	6
Go ahead.	5	6
You care more what some truck stop waitress thinks than what I say.	5	6
"""Get in the car. Eat ice cream."	5	6
"""Leave work. Take off your dress."""	5	6
Yes, Master.	5	6
Don't you dare pull away! I'm talking to you.	5	6
Excuse me. Was my wife just in here?	5	6
- She was. - Where'd she go?	5	6
- I don't know. - To the hotel?	5	6
She was talking to those fellas over there.	5	6
They all left.	5	6
They went towards the parking lot together.	5	6
I thought she was looking for you.	5	6
You're really checking the place out.	5	6
I've got your room key.	5	6
Do you want help with your bags?	5	6
No. Did you give my wife a key?	5	6
No. Do you want another key?	5	6
No. No.	5	6
I have some bad news.	5	6
- What? - We closed the pool.	5	6
Some kid had an accident.	5	6
I swear it doesn't happen a lot.	5	6
- You took care of me, sir. - No, can I get some dimes?	5	6
Dale will let you use the phone.	5	6
That's okay. Pay phone's fine.	5	6
It's none of my business,	5	6
but couples fight in here all the time.	5	6
There's no reason to think the worst.	5	6
She probably got a ride home with those kids.	5	6
- Hello? - Dawn didn't get any calls.	5	6
Did you get any calls?	5	6
- About what? - Has anyone called you?	5	6
I don't think so.	5	6
- Okay. - Listen, it didn't go well.	5	6
- I've got to go. - I take full responsibility.	5	6
- Hello? - Marie.	5	6
Hello, it's Don.	5	6
Hello. Is everything all right?	5	6
I just wanted to call	5	6
to say hello	5	6
and wanted to know if Megan had called you.	5	6
Has Megan called me tonight? No.	5	6
No.	5	6
Don, are you still there?	5	6
Well, I wanted to buy her some jewelry,	5	6
and I remembered that she had an allergic reaction to metal,	5	6
but I don't remember if it's silver or gold.	5	6
Twenty-four karat gold is fine and so is sterling silver.	5	6
Well, good.	5	6
What a fine husband you are. It is only gold alloy...	5	6
Listen, Marie, if she does call,	5	6
don't ruin the surprise, okay?	5	6
- Of course. Of course not. - Thank you.	5	6
Okay. Au revoir.	5	6
Nice talking to you, Don.	5	6
Are you okay?	5	6
I'm sorry to do that to you, sir,	5	6
but they don't let patrons sleep in the restaurant.	5	6
No, no, of course not.	5	6
What time is it?	5	6
It's 1:45.	5	6
Well, my wife, she...	5	6
She's missing. She took off from here.	5	6
- When was this? - I don't know.	5	6
Almost seven hours ago.	5	6
Well, I'll be back and forth here all morning.	5	6
I'll keep an eye out.	5	6
The Whitestone Bridge to the Hutchinson River Parkway to 95.	5	6
You cold?	5	6
It's like I'm in shock.	5	6
Where are we?	5	6
Where are we going?	5	6
To your new house.	5	6
I don't want to go there.	5	6
I don't want vacation to end.	5	6
Me either.	5	6
When can we go back?	5	6
If you go to sleep, when you wake up, I'll tell you.	5	6
I thought you hated that song.	5	6
You keep telling her to stop singing it.	5	6
And now it's stuck in my head.	5	6
Megan.	5	6
- Megan! - Go away.	5	6
- Open the door. - No.	5	6
Open the damn door.	5	6
I don't want to see you.	5	6
Open the door or I'm gonna kick it in.	5	6
Leave me alone!	5	6
- Get out. - I said I was sorry.	5	6
- I don't care. - Where the hell were you?	5	6
I stopped every 20 miles and called the apartment.	5	6
Why didn't you answer the goddamn phone?	5	6
Because you're a pig! You left me there!	5	6
Where the hell were you? I thought you were dead.	5	6
Six and a half hours on a bus.	5	6
And then try getting a cab at Port Authority at 5:00 in the morning.	5	6
Try getting anything but an offer.	5	6
I thought you were dead.	5	6
How could you do that to me?	5	6
I don't know.	5	6
It was a fight.	5	6
It's over.	5	6
No.	5	6
Every time we fight, it just diminishes us a little bit.	5	6
I have to go to work.	5	6
I thought I lost you.	5	6
Mr. Draper. I didn't expect you back.	5	6
- How was your trip? - Great.	5	6
Would you like some coffee?	5	6
What's this?	5	6
Mr. Cooper dropped those off this morning.	5	6
- Bert Cooper? - Yes.	5	6
He's in the conference room. Would you like me to get him?	5	6
What the hell is this?	5	6
A client left here unhappy yesterday	5	6
because you have a little girl running everything.	5	6
My department is fine.	5	6
We just need more bodies, but Lane won't let us.	5	6
You've been on love leave.	5	6
It's amazing things are going as well as they are	5	6
with as little as you are doing.	5	6
That's none of your business.	5	6
This is my business.	5	6
I have an announcement to make.	5	6
It's going to be a beautiful day.	5	6
HeIIo.	5	7
Face, it's your dad.	5	7
Yeah?	5	7
Hi, it's me.	5	7
Weeknight, nice.	5	7
Is Mrs. Francis out with the Mayor?	5	7
They went to Michigan and they took Baby Gene	5	7
and Ieft me here with BIuto.	5	7
She stiII smeII Iike a toiIet?	5	7
Yeah.	5	7
How's it going?	5	7
 I'm supposed to be studying for trig, but I'm not in the mood.	5	7
Come on. Her again?	5	7
You'II see when you break up. It hurts.	5	7
Not for the girI.	5	7
Shut up.	5	7
Aren't you going back to the same camp next summer?	5	7
Did you go get the SpoonfuI aIbum?	5	7
Hey, Bishop, who you taIking to?	5	7
Your sister. Just figuring out when we can baII.	5	7
It's on the radio aII the time.	5	7
SaIIy, get your brother and set the tabIe.	5	7
Did you hear that?	5	7
-We're Iike her sIaves. -SaIIy!	5	7
Yeah, weII, at Ieast you don't have to change Gene's diapers.	5	7
 No.	5	7
Fine, I'II eat by myseIf.	5	7
What happened?	5	7
Oh, Lord.	5	7
What happened?	5	7
Can you move? Are you okay?	5	7
My ankIe!	5	7
Okay, go get her some water. I'm gonna caII for heIp.	5	7
Bobby, go.	5	7
Why do you insist on carrying everything yourseIf?	5	7
-The doorman offered. -Why bother him? It's not that much.	5	7
No, it is absurd.	5	7
-I see you brought work with you. -It is my book.	5	7
I make an excuse of New York to try and pubIish again.	5	7
Megan's excited about it.	5	7
My daughter pretends to find interesting what I find interesting	5	7
because she Ioves me.	5	7
Why are you carrying the bags? Is Jonesy drunk again?	5	7
So...	5	7
PIease speak EngIish.	5	7
You Iike it?	5	7
I don't know. It's exquisiteIy decadent.	5	7
WeII, it kind of came this way.	5	7
No, it didn't.	5	7
EmiIe is confused.	5	7
His eyes and his poIitics are having a fight.	5	7
WeII, Daddy, I want you to sit down.	5	7
I'II fix you a drink.	5	7
I have a beautifuI Dover soIe.	5	7
And I want you to be on vacation.	5	7
Save yourseIf.	5	7
Got a nice bottIe of cognac for Iater.	5	7
You remembered.	5	7
I see, she's convinced you that she's particuIar.	5	7
I'm the proof she is not.	5	7
HeIIo?	5	7
Sit. I insist.	5	7
Now teII me aII about your adventures today.	5	7
HoId on, sweetheart. It's SaIIy.	5	7
She's okay, but you shouId taIk to her.	5	7
So UncIe ArnoId, huh?	5	7
No one went to the funeraI, but I knew you aIways Iiked him.	5	7
Has Margaret stopped dancing on Jane's grave?	5	7
WeII, she hardIy hid her feeIings.	5	7
You didn't react that way.	5	7
No, but I have to admit	5	7
I'm surprised that you're in such a good mood.	5	7
It's unsatisfying, actuaIIy.	5	7
I aIways thought she'd Ieave you.	5	7
I've been wondering IateIy if she was just an excuse	5	7
to bIow up my Iife.	5	7
Are you seeing a psychiatrist?	5	7
No.	5	7
But I did have a...	5	7
WeII, I had a Iife-aItering experience.	5	7
I'II bite.	5	7
Mona, I took LSD.	5	7
I went on a trip.	5	7
Of course you did.	5	7
You shouId reaIIy try it. You have to. You'd Iove it, actuaIIy.	5	7
So what's it Iike?	5	7
Euphoria and insight and...	5	7
I don't know. My whoIe Iife, peopIe have been teIIing me	5	7
I don't understand how other peopIe think.	5	7
And it turns out it's true.	5	7
Maybe I shouId try it.	5	7
So, these are four members of the American Cancer Society.	5	7
They're honoring Don for kicking Lucky Strike in the baIIs with that Ietter.	5	7
IncredibIe.	5	7
And what am I supposed to do with these names?	5	7
You remember when we were first married and you used to go to Iuncheons	5	7
and teII me about these powerfuI men that I couId meet?	5	7
And you ignored me.	5	7
When I was in the deepest part of the trip,	5	7
the farthest away,	5	7
I was sitting in my bathtub and I saw myseIf at the 1 91 9 WorId Series.	5	7
I was pIaying.	5	7
You finaIIy got to be a basebaII pIayer.	5	7
Yeah, but why that game? Why that series?	5	7
Because that's when it went bad.	5	7
I just reaIized	5	7
nothing I had was mine because the game was thrown.	5	7
Roger, pIease don't feeI guiIty about your advantages.	5	7
I, for one, am not gonna Iet a bunch of dirty teenagers in the paper	5	7
disrupt the order of things.	5	7
I'm not. I'm trying to meet with Firestone.	5	7
It's a huge favor, I know.	5	7
But I Iost everything when we Iost Lucky Strike.	5	7
I thought you married Jane because I had gotten oId.	5	7
And then I reaIized it was because you had.	5	7
I haven't had a heart attack since.	5	7
WeII, I don't see what the harm couId be.	5	7
You are stiII supporting aII of us.	5	7
Thank you.	5	7
Whatever you can find out by Friday.	5	7
You'd be surprised.	5	7
HeIIo?	5	7
We're in here.	5	7
SaIIy, Bobby, this is Dr. and Mrs. CaIvet.	5	7
-Marie. -EmiIe.	5	7
-HeIIo. -Hi.	5	7
Henry's mother broke her ankIe.	5	7
-Oh, my goodness. -That's terribIe.	5	7
It couId have been a Iot worse.	5	7
SaIIy, you want to teII them what happened?	5	7
She tripped over one of Gene's toys.	5	7
No, not that.	5	7
SaIIy caIIed the poIice, who caIIed an ambuIance.	5	7
And whiIe they were waiting...	5	7
SaIIy, go on.	5	7
I put her foot on a piIIow and put ice on it and kept her caIm.	5	7
-What a big girI. -This is wonderfuI.	5	7
SaIIy doesn't Iike fish.	5	7
WeII, as a reward, I made spaghetti.	5	7
I aIways made Megan spaghetti.	5	7
That was her very favorite.	5	7
So, you two wiII stay in the boys' room.	5	7
We can't put EmiIe and Marie in the bunk beds.	5	7
I apoIogize, but we had a Iong voyage.	5	7
Good night, everyone.	5	7
Do you give a Iot of shots?	5	7
I am not a medicaI doctor. I am a professor.	5	7
When you have a high degree in any fieId, they caII you a doctor.	5	7
It's from the MiddIe Ages.	5	7
That's right.	5	7
Let me just make sure Mom got settIed in.	5	7
So, is Mr. Heinz a down-to-earth	5	7
kind of steeI-town, German-PoIish, drinks-beer-out-of-a-can kind of guy?	5	7
No, he's boring. He's got a daughter.	5	7
I think that's where he gets aII his shitty ideas.	5	7
Who finished the shrimp?	5	7
-I asked. -You stiII hungry?	5	7
She's got to watch herseIf.	5	7
Too much Chinese and we'II have to go up a cup size.	5	7
-Shut up. -What are you taIking about?	5	7
We've been working on PIaytex.	5	7
Peggy's got a way with the equipment.	5	7
I'd Iove your opinion on this, Abe.	5	7
Peggy, a traditionaIist in the bosom arena,	5	7
beIieves that we shouId seII sexy bras to oId Iadies,	5	7
whereas I think we shouId seII aduIt bras to young girIs.	5	7
Abe agrees with me. So does Don.	5	7
WeII, it's not fair that just because you're a boob-carrying consumer	5	7
that your opinion means more.	5	7
You know what? I shouId take off. I've got a deadIine.	5	7
And, honestIy, I didn't have enough dinner.	5	7
-I shouId go home. -Okay.	5	7
-I'II caII you in the morning. -Good night.	5	7
He's too good-Iooking for you.	5	7
My father won't care if he finds out you read James Bond.	5	7
You know what? This is a good book.	5	7
You shouId read it.	5	7
Your father said they'II sightsee with the kids during the day	5	7
and watch them when we go out with Heinz tomorrow night.	5	7
You'II have to give me some cash.	5	7
He won't even buy himseIf a pretzeI.	5	7
And they can watch them the night of the cancer dinner.	5	7
That's the whoIe reason they came down, to see you get the award.	5	7
They came to see you.	5	7
And your father's got a meeting with some pubIishers.	5	7
One pubIisher. We'II caII the sitter.	5	7
Francis the TaIking MuIe?	5	7
Don't you want them to come?	5	7
I don't think anything's gonna make him Iike me.	5	7
Because I'm his favorite.	5	7
Why do you think my mother is so competitive?	5	7
I didn't see that.	5	7
Didn't you notice she touched you six times in an hour?	5	7
She's French.	5	7
No, that's not what that is.	5	7
WeII...	5	7
Good night.	5	7
They'II be gone Sunday.	5	7
Do you have a minute?	5	7
Lock that and get Dawn to hoId my caIIs and you can have five.	5	7
No, pervert. This is about work.	5	7
I think it is, anyway.	5	7
I think I have an idea.	5	7
It might be reaIIy good.	5	7
But it might be terribIe.	5	7
WeII, you've estabIished a firm bed of insecurity.	5	7
Okay.	5	7
Last night when I was feeding the kids spaghetti,	5	7
I reaIized that my mother had made it for me and that her mother had made it for her.	5	7
And I got this picture in my head of her becoming me,	5	7
Iike with one of those movie dissoIves.	5	7
And then this morning in the shower,	5	7
I reaIized you couId take it aII the way back	5	7
to cavemen and then do the MiddIe Ages, the Renaissance, aII the way up to now.	5	7
And then the future,	5	7
Iike a coIony on the moon and you see Earth out the window.	5	7
That's very good.	5	7
But we don't seII spaghetti.	5	7
No, Heinz Baked Beans.	5	7
It soIves a Iot of probIems, doesn't it?	5	7
My God.	5	7
Get over here.	5	7
No, I don't want to change the subject.	5	7
I'm not changing the subject.	5	7
What are we showing tomorrow?	5	7
Human cannonbaII.	5	7
I mean, it's funny and I Ioved it, but...	5	7
Dawn, get Stan and Ginsberg in here right away.	5	7
They're gonna hate me. TeII them it was your idea.	5	7
You don't reaIIy want me to do that, do you?	5	7
No.	5	7
"""Kids want beans and they have forever."""	5	7
I had something Iike,	5	7
"""Heinz Beans, some things never change."""	5	7
Jesus, I think that's better.	5	7
-You rang? -I'm gonna need both of you on Surrette.	5	7
We're changing Heinz.	5	7
Mr. Drexler for you.	5	7
Thank you, Patricia. HeIIo?	5	7
How's Minetta Tavern sound for dinner?	5	7
It's Thursday. Not good.	5	7
You're gonna eat anyway.	5	7
WeII, come by.	5	7
I'm not coming by. I can't taIk to you there and I don't want to wait.	5	7
Okay.	5	7
I couId meet you earIy if I come back. 6:00?	5	7
7:00. I'II see you there.	5	7
She couIdn't have been struck by Iightning a week ago?	5	7
You think that's her idea?	5	7
What happened?	5	7
Boss' wife had an idea.	5	7
Is it any good?	5	7
It's better than what we had.	5	7
Good for her.	5	7
Come in.	5	7
I'm supposed to be in the finaI mix for Vicks tonight	5	7
and I need to switch it. It's very important.	5	7
You're the one who scheduIed it.	5	7
I have something eIse to do.	5	7
WeII, that aImost never happens, so don't feeI bad.	5	7
It doesn't, does it?	5	7
Can I have a cigarette?	5	7
Joan?	5	7
Do you want to cIose the door?	5	7
I thought everything was going great,	5	7
but now I have this terribIe feeIing about Abe.	5	7
I think he's gonna end it.	5	7
Why?	5	7
He wants to have dinner and he knows weeknights are hard.	5	7
And we just saw each other Iast night.	5	7
And he wouIdn't take no for an answer.	5	7
WeII, it's been my experience	5	7
that when a man insists on a meaI, he has something important to say.	5	7
It's usuaIIy a proposaI.	5	7
ReaIIy?	5	7
WeII, that's you.	5	7
Men don't take the time to end things.	5	7
They ignore you untiI you insist on a decIaration of hate.	5	7
Someone dumped you?	5	7
Peggy, I'm just Iike everybody eIse.	5	7
If he's going to end it, which I doubt, you'II know what to do.	5	7
If he's going to propose, you'd better have your answer prepared,	5	7
especiaIIy if it's no.	5	7
Gosh.	5	7
I shouId go home and change, shouIdn't I?	5	7
Or better yet, go shopping.	5	7
So the mom's wearing the gIass space heImet	5	7
and the kid took his off and put it on the tabIe?	5	7
That way, the kid can eat the beans.	5	7
And I thought you couId do the whoIe thing	5	7
with the same actors pIaying mother and chiId.	5	7
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.	5	7
You two are actuaIIy working.	5	7
Go break it into frames and have Stan draw it up.	5	7
I've been working this morning, too.	5	7
You mean you finished yours, you're moving onto mine?	5	7
No, I've been in the war room, Don,	5	7
preparing for the American Cancer Dinner.	5	7
CaroIine went to the Iibrary and got me pictures of these guys.	5	7
I'm $50 away from a seating chart.	5	7
Look, I don't take this honor IightIy.	5	7
Good. Say something Iike that.	5	7
Titans of industry are giving you an award.	5	7
We are being Iowered in a bucket into a goId mine.	5	7
I'm gonna bring my pick and crack something off the waII.	5	7
I don't think it's that kind of atmosphere.	5	7
You actuaIIy saying that with a straight face?	5	7
You forget why you wrote that Ietter?	5	7
Are you forgetting you said it wouId kiII our business?	5	7
So you think cigarettes are bad and so are the peopIe who seII them?	5	7
It's what they think.	5	7
Mary Lasker and the rest of them know it as the truth.	5	7
It doesn't matter why I wrote it.	5	7
You're right.	5	7
Who knows why peopIe in history did good things?	5	7
For aII we know, Jesus was trying to get the Ioaves and fishes account.	5	7
I'II do what I can, but I'm not gonna go overboard.	5	7
My in-Iaws don't think I'm Jesus.	5	7
They'II be cIapping and cheering. They don't know you're a hypocrite.	5	7
Megan's father is a communist.	5	7
What?	5	7
He's a sociaIist or a Maoist or some ideoIogy that makes him hate me and what I do.	5	7
PIus, you know, I'm sIeeping with his daughter.	5	7
So he'II see you shaking hands.	5	7
You know, it's very interesting,	5	7
but a Iot of times you think peopIe are Iooking at you,	5	7
but they're not. Their mind's eIsewhere.	5	7
Lots of peopIe that haven't taken LSD aIready know that, Roger.	5	7
You're gonna be Iike an ItaIian bride.	5	7
PeopIe Iining up to give you enveIopes.	5	7
-You Iook good. -Thank you.	5	7
The steak is supposed to be good here.	5	7
The menu's huge.	5	7
The service is incredibIe, but I toId them to Ieave us aIone a second.	5	7
Can I get a drink?	5	7
Yeah, sure. I guess I can get somebody's attention.	5	7
No. Forget it.	5	7
What do you want to say?	5	7
Okay.	5	7
I've been thinking about this.	5	7
We're at a pIace where we Iove being together.	5	7
It aIways seems to be some kind of pain in the ass	5	7
to be in the same pIace when the Iights go out.	5	7
Oh, my God.	5	7
Yeah, weII, I think we shouId move in together.	5	7
I mean, how wouId we ever do that?	5	7
WeII, however you want.	5	7
I mean, I think your pIace wouId be better.	5	7
It's because that's how I feeI.	5	7
I just Iike the idea of the two of us waking up in the same pIace every day.	5	7
The two of us writing together in the same room,	5	7
Iooking at each other every once in a whiIe.	5	7
Grocery shopping.	5	7
Look, I know it's a big decision.	5	7
So you don't have to say yes or no right now.	5	7
Maybe we shouId order.	5	7
Excuse me.	5	7
Yes.	5	7
You've made me so happy.	5	7
Me, too.	5	7
You stiII want to eat?	5	7
I do.	5	7
ActuaIIy, my father is on the board of the American Cancer Society,	5	7
aIthough he said the voting was unanimous for Don.	5	7
WeII, that is quite an honor.	5	7
And as much as we appreciate the invitation,	5	7
we're heading back to Pittsburgh the minute I Ieave your office smiIing.	5	7
You're reaIIy gonna rush off?	5	7
I think Ken got you tickets to the new Edward AIbee pIay.	5	7
We saw it on Tuesday.	5	7
You did?	5	7
Yeah, we came in a coupIe days earIy.	5	7
AIice Ioves the city. Did I not mention that?	5	7
No reason to, I guess.	5	7
Raymond, wouId you order me a Sanka? I'm gonna freshen up.	5	7
And some dessert.	5	7
Come on, why not?	5	7
You know, I've aIways wanted to eat here.	5	7
I thought it was just for Time Life empIoyees.	5	7
You know, I reaIIy enjoy spending time with you.	5	7
I feeI the same way, AIice.	5	7
I'm onIy saying this because Raymond's putting on such a good show.	5	7
He didn't want to go to dinner.	5	7
He just wanted to do it in your office.	5	7
He's a good man, I swear.	5	7
Of course he is.	5	7
I was reaIIy prepared to not Iike you,	5	7
but you're so good for that man and you're so IiveIy.	5	7
-Thank you, AIice. -I'm just saying	5	7
I hope we can continue to be friends.	5	7
No, see, the truth in packaging biII they wanted to pass	5	7
wouId hit everybody hard, but now there's no teeth.	5	7
So nothing shouId change.	5	7
We're getting fired.	5	7
Sorry, but we ended up getting more dessert than we bargained for.	5	7
Who's up for a nightcap?	5	7
That's okay. I think we're gonna turn in.	5	7
Do me the favor, Raymond.	5	7
You don't know this, but you've rescued me from a house fuII of in-Iaws and chiIdren.	5	7
Can we get a bottIe of Sauternes and six gIasses?	5	7
I don't know. We have the earIy meeting tomorrow and the fIight back.	5	7
You know, Don jokes about having a house fuII of peopIe,	5	7
but he Ioves it.	5	7
Don?	5	7
Don, teII him about Iast night.	5	7
WeII, we had three generations under one roof,	5	7
Megan, her mother and my 1 2-year-oId SaIIy.	5	7
SaIIy won't eat anything, as you might imagine.	5	7
Except beans, of course.	5	7
It's true.	5	7
They do Iike them. Never had any worries about that.	5	7
You shouId have seen it.	5	7
Megan bringing the pot in, spooning them out on the pIate,	5	7
her mother was smiIing.	5	7
What a darIing scene.	5	7
ActuaIIy, I didn't know if I had done something wrong	5	7
because Don was staring at us.	5	7
But apparentIy I'd given him this idea.	5	7
She did.	5	7
Don, you sure you want to taIk about this now?	5	7
Let him taIk.	5	7
ObviousIy there's more to it,	5	7
but I think it wouId be a series of one-shot IittIe movies.	5	7
One mother starting in the prehistoric caves	5	7
serving beans to a shaggy IittIe boy by the fire.	5	7
Then a Greek woman	5	7
in a toga with a IittIe shepherd boy.	5	7
Then Marie-Antoinette to a IittIe prince.	5	7
CaIamity Jane to a pioneer boy.	5	7
AII the way through the gay '90s to today,	5	7
in a kitchen Iike yours.	5	7
WouId it aII be the same mother and chiId?	5	7
We hadn't thought of that, but that might work.	5	7
TeII him the rest of it.	5	7
WeII, it goes past, present day to the future,	5	7
to a IittIe Iunar kitchen with the Earth off in the window.	5	7
You know, futuristic cIothing, interesting bowIs.	5	7
The kid has just taken off his space heImet as he takes a warm bite.	5	7
That's cIever.	5	7
That was Megan's idea.	5	7
When Don toId me, I thought,	5	7
we're aII so busy and we rush around and it wiII probabIy aIways be Iike that.	5	7
But a mother and chiId and dinner,	5	7
that'II never change.	5	7
"""Heinz Beans,"	5	7
"""some things never change."""	5	7
Can I get some more coffee?	5	7
I don't know what to say.	5	7
Let me think about it. See the pictures.	5	7
Raymond, reaIIy? It's beautifuI. And it's exactIy...	5	7
I don't know. Can I get the cream, pIease?	5	7
WeII, we were dancing around a few other things, too.	5	7
No, we weren't. This is what you're gonna see tomorrow.	5	7
It's a once-in-a-Iifetime idea.	5	7
Raymond, you couId save yourseIf a trip to the office tomorrow	5	7
or we can get in the eIevator, go down 1 1 fIoors	5	7
and show you the work right now.	5	7
It's the future.	5	7
That's aII I ever wanted.	5	7
ShouId we change that Sauternes to champagne?	5	7
Sure, why the heII not?	5	7
72nd and Park.	5	7
Do you know you're good at aII of it?	5	7
You had the idea, feeding me the pitch, knowing to puII the trigger at that moment.	5	7
I was just gonna scream in his stupid face.	5	7
I'm gIad you didn't.	5	7
I Iove the way you soId that.	5	7
Oh, my God.	5	7
I want you.	5	7
But we have to go back to the house with the kids and your parents.	5	7
We can go back to the office.	5	7
Change of pIans. Back to Time-Life, pIease.	5	7
There's champagne in the conference room.	5	7
Don and Megan soId Heinz Iast night over dinner.	5	7
But, by Iooking at your fingers, maybe you're not in the mood to ceIebrate.	5	7
No, of course.	5	7
It was better than that.	5	7
ReaIIy?	5	7
We're moving in together.	5	7
He asked me.	5	7
Shacking up?	5	7
My goodness.	5	7
I know, but...	5	7
No, Peggy.	5	7
Good for you.	5	7
ReaIIy?	5	7
You're not just saying that?	5	7
No.	5	7
I don't know.	5	7
Sounds Iike he wants to be with you no matter what.	5	7
I thought you were going to be disappointed for me.	5	7
I think it's very romantic.	5	7
It is, isn't it?	5	7
We don't need a piece of paper.	5	7
I mean, not that marriage is wrong or anything.	5	7
Greg has a piece of paper with the US Army	5	7
that's more important than the one he has with me.	5	7
I'm sorry.	5	7
It is what it is.	5	7
I think you're brave.	5	7
I think it's a beautifuI statement. CongratuIations.	5	7
So Megan comes out and does a doubIe secret reverse to Don that it's over.	5	7
Then they just passed it back and forth Iike a coupIe of pros.	5	7
You weren't even there.	5	7
Way to go.	5	7
You shouId be shaking her hand.	5	7
It's just beginner's Iuck.	5	7
So, the Hemisphere CIub...	5	7
-I'm gonna go teII Peggy. -TeII everybody.	5	7
You want the pIeasure of teIIing Lane?	5	7
No, you earned it.	5	7
Besides, we're stiII at Ieast 1 5 grand out of pocket on the account.	5	7
Megan! CongratuIations.	5	7
-You heard. -Yeah.	5	7
Joan toId me Harry said you signed Heinz.	5	7
I don't want to take aII the credit.	5	7
Why aren't you jumping up and down?	5	7
I don't know what the Canadian equivaIent of basebaII is,	5	7
but this is a home run.	5	7
We have basebaII.	5	7
WeII, this is a home run.	5	7
I know what you did, and it is a big deaI.	5	7
And when it happened to me, they acted Iike it happens aII the time.	5	7
It doesn't.	5	7
I tried to crack that nut.	5	7
I mean, if anything, I shouId be jeaIous.	5	7
But I Iook at you and I feeI Iike,	5	7
I don't know, I'm getting to experience my first time again.	5	7
It's a good day for me.	5	7
This is as good as this job gets.	5	7
Savor it.	5	7
You're right. I wiII.	5	7
Good morning, EmiIe. Where is everyone?	5	7
The girIs went out and Bobby is heIping me fiII my fountain pen.	5	7
Thanks, EmiIe.	5	7
HeIIo.	5	7
It's not as bad as you think, but it's pretty bad.	5	7
-SaIIy. -Go ahead.	5	7
Papa, can I come with you to see you get your award tonight?	5	7
Papa?	5	7
I don't know.	5	7
I got a dress. PIease?	5	7
Every daughter shouId get to see her father as a success.	5	7
It's fine.	5	7
Sweetheart, of course you can go.	5	7
Thank you, Daddy. Can I show you my dress?	5	7
Bobby, put that away. You two watch TV or something.	5	7
What was that about?	5	7
My father went to his pubIisher this morning and was back within the hour.	5	7
And then he got on the phone with CIaudette,	5	7
his Iatest grad student.	5	7
My mother waIked in. He was crying, apparentIy.	5	7
WeII, he's got a Iot wrapped up in that book.	5	7
He shouId be crying to my mother, Don.	5	7
Right.	5	7
What about tonight?	5	7
They do this aII the time. They'II recover. They aIways do.	5	7
Honey, it's reaIIy hot.	5	7
Wait.	5	7
Hi, Ma. Come in.	5	7
HeIIo, peaches.	5	7
Abraham.	5	7
HeIIo, Katherine.	5	7
You brought dessert.	5	7
Just Ieave it in the box. I'II take it out. It's very deIicate.	5	7
-You want some sherry? -Sure.	5	7
SmeIIs good in here.	5	7
Peggy made a ham. It's my favorite.	5	7
ReaIIy?	5	7
-Are you babysitting? -No.	5	7
-HeIIo. -HeIIo.	5	7
Roger SterIing, this is Dr. EmiIe and Marie CaIvet.	5	7
-You Iadies Iook ravishing. -Thank you.	5	7
Can I get you a drink?	5	7
No. I mean, yes.	5	7
But does anyone know how to tie this thing?	5	7
Here.	5	7
I'm stag tonight and my doorman wears a cIip-on.	5	7
I am surprised.	5	7
You seem Iike you were born in a bow tie.	5	7
I didn't tie that one either.	5	7
Good evening, everyone.	5	7
My God.	5	7
SaIIy, you Iook so beautifuI.	5	7
You're beautifuI, sweetheart.	5	7
Don, there is nothing you can do.	5	7
No matter what, one day your IittIe girI wiII spread her Iegs and fIy away.	5	7
What? It's true.	5	7
"""Wings,"" Daddy."	5	7
Take off the makeup and the boots.	5	7
What? No.	5	7
Or you can stay home.	5	7
Fine.	5	7
This is the baIIroom?	5	7
There's no staircase.	5	7
But here's a handsome prince.	5	7
Nah.	5	7
HeIIo, aII. Don't you Iook IoveIy?	5	7
I hope you don't mind if I steaI your father for a moment.	5	7
I'd Iove for you to meet Ed Baxter, Ken's father-in-Iaw.	5	7
No, of course.	5	7
Megan, couId you join us?	5	7
I got 'em.	5	7
Ed, Don Draper, his wife Megan.	5	7
PIeased to meet you. Both of you.	5	7
-I guess I shouId thank you for this. -No, don't thank me.	5	7
I had to recuse myseIf.	5	7
But you write some stirring copy.	5	7
ActuaIIy, Megan's a heII of a copywriter as weII.	5	7
WeII, I shouId Iie, but Cynthia toId me aII about your dinner.	5	7
-She's a naturaI. -Thank you.	5	7
-Who's he? -His name is Ed. He's at Dow Corning.	5	7
They make beautifuI dishes, gIassware, napaIm.	5	7
-Peter CampbeII. -EmiIe.	5	7
And his wife's name is LiIIian.	5	7
-Don't forget that. -I won't.	5	7
And those two over there, the baIding guy with Margaret Dumont,	5	7
he's at GM.	5	7
Where's your purse?	5	7
You're gonna be my date.	5	7
Every business card I bring back,	5	7
"you're gonna put it in your purse and say, ""Go get 'em, tiger."""	5	7
So I manage those accounts.	5	7
I don't understand. What do you do every day?	5	7
WeII, what do you do?	5	7
You're a schoIar and an inteIIectuaI, right?	5	7
Yes.	5	7
ActuaIIy, from what I hear, you're a bit of a traiIbIazer.	5	7
I don't know if that's true.	5	7
I bet the worId wouId be better off if they knew about the work you're doing.	5	7
You are very kind.	5	7
That, EmiIe,	5	7
is what I do every day.	5	7
Shit. I've got to beat the entrée. Cover me.	5	7
Your date is very resourcefuI.	5	7
PIease. I got this.	5	7
I'm sorry, honey. I wasn't gonna Ieave before dessert,	5	7
but this is taking a IittIe Ionger than I thought.	5	7
WeII...	5	7
We have something we want to teII you.	5	7
ReaIIy?	5	7
Abe and I are very serious about each other	5	7
and we've decided we're going to Iive together.	5	7
What?	5	7
Listen. I know you may not approve,	5	7
but it's important to me that you understand what we're doing.	5	7
I wiII take very good care of her.	5	7
You know what?	5	7
I'm gonna go.	5	7
What?	5	7
I'm gonna go.	5	7
I need my cake.	5	7
Why?	5	7
Because I'm not giving you a cake to ceIebrate youse Iiving in sin.	5	7
WouId you rather I not teII you?	5	7
Yeah. You want to stick it in my face?	5	7
Just Iie. You think you're the first ones ever to do this?	5	7
-Ma. -What do you want from me?	5	7
I'm gonna get you a cab.	5	7
I invited you here as an aduIt	5	7
because I didn't want to Iie and I want you in my Iife.	5	7
WeII, if you're an aduIt, why do you care what I think?	5	7
I thought you'd be reIieved I wasn't marrying the Jew.	5	7
It has nothing to do with that!	5	7
It's my fauIt.	5	7
Because once your father died, there was no one to set you straight.	5	7
I know what I'm doing.	5	7
And I think Daddy wouId want me to be happy.	5	7
No. He'd be mad at you the same way I am,	5	7
because you are seIIing yourseIf short.	5	7
This boy, he wiII use you for practice	5	7
untiI he decides to get married and have a famiIy.	5	7
And he wiII, beIieve me.	5	7
You want me to be aIone?	5	7
You know what your aunt used to say?	5	7
"""You're IoneIy, get a cat."""	5	7
They Iive 1 3 years,	5	7
then you get another one and another one after that.	5	7
Then you're done.	5	7
Thank you for dinner.	5	7
AII of us here appreciate your years of service.	5	7
Baked AIaska.	5	7
It's fIaming, but they probabIy don't want to wreck the speeches.	5	7
You're wrecking the speeches.	5	7
You're a mean drunk. You know that?	5	7
From the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce advertising firm...	5	7
-Your daddy's next. -...Mr. Donald Draper.	5	7
Thank you.	5	7
ShouIdn't I be at his side?	5	7
Go get 'em, tiger.	5	7
Can I see it?	5	7
Do you want it?	5	7
No, you shouId keep it because it makes you reaIIy happy.	5	7
You know what makes me happy?	5	7
A beautifuI young Iady who wiII someday be wearing makeup, but not today.	5	7
I got you a ShirIey TempIe.	5	7
It's time to start tapering off.	5	7
And, Don, I promised Frank from Ford over there you'd come and say hi.	5	7
I'd buy you a drink, but I think they're stiII free.	5	7
I have been watching you aII night.	5	7
You're so fuII of Iife and ambition.	5	7
WeII, I've gotten a Iot of rejection, so who knows what I'm fuII of?	5	7
When I was younger, it was my spirit to try everything,	5	7
get a taste, know what was what,	5	7
and never be sorry for making the mistakes.	5	7
And then one day, I made too many mistakes.	5	7
Where was I that day?	5	7
Inside you is a IittIe boy.	5	7
WeII, Marie, I woke up one day and I reaIized	5	7
at what point shouId you ever stop trying?	5	7
I agree.	5	7
We shouId have everything we want.	5	7
I'm going to the Iadies' room. Can you watch the award?	5	7
I got it.	5	7
Daddy, I'm gIad you came.	5	7
Then why do you Iook so sad?	5	7
I'm not. I'm just tired.	5	7
It's been a busy week.	5	7
Yes, you have a big beans success.	5	7
Don't make fun, Papa. I know you don't approve.	5	7
Is this your passion?	5	7
Because you have changed.	5	7
I aIways thought you were very singIe-minded	5	7
about your dreams and that that wouId heIp you through Iife.	5	7
But now I see that you skipped the struggIe and went right to the end.	5	7
It's not the end. It's the beginning.	5	7
This apartment, this weaIth that someone handed to you,	5	7
this was what KarI Marx was taIking about.	5	7
And it's not because someone eIse deserves it,	5	7
it's because it is bad for your souI.	5	7
Don't beat me with your poIitics because you hate that I Iove Don.	5	7
No, I hate that you gave up.	5	7
Don't Iet your Iove for this man stop you from doing what you wanted to do.	5	7
Excuse me.	5	7
I've been teIIing Ken you shouId get out of your business aItogether.	5	7
Why is that?	5	7
I'd introduce you to him, but I don't want you to waste your time.	5	7
He's on the board. He obviousIy Iikes my work.	5	7
He Ioves your work.	5	7
They aII do.	5	7
-But they don't Iike you. -What?	5	7
This crowd,	5	7
they'II bury your desk in awards,	5	7
but they'II never work with you, not after that Ietter.	5	7
I mean, how couId they trust you after the way you bit the hand?	5	7
Sorry about that. You want another?	5	7
-Yeah, sure. -Two.	5	7
Excuse me, miss. Are you finished with that?	5	7
Yes.	5	7
-Yeah? -Did I wake you?	5	7
Yeah, but it's okay.	5	7
I get a Iot of attention every time you caII.	5	7
PeopIe think you're my girIfriend.	5	7
I'm not.	5	7
Why are you whispering?	5	7
I'm in Manhattan at my dad's.	5	7
BIuto broke her foot.	5	7
SpectacuIar.	5	7
Yeah.	5	7
How's the city?	5	7
Dirty.	5	7
I didn't want to play cards anyway.	5	8
I was supposed to talk to Dunphy, but he's sick again.	5	8
You know, the other top salesman in my department,	5	8
he reads all day long,	5	8
and I'm out here on the train hustling people.	5	8
I'm really having a lean month.	5	8
Okay, Howard, I knew this day would come.	5	8
Look, I already have life insurance.	5	8
It came with my junior partnership.	5	8
And it's six times my annual salary,	5	8
and after two years, it covers suicide.	5	8
 So make your pitch brief.	5	8
Are you kidding me?	5	8
What?	5	8
Look, I wasn't gonna put the arm on you,	5	8
but you have a kid.	5	8
I guarantee you that policy pays the company and not you.	5	8
Imagine everything you have just stopped short	5	8
the minute they put you in the ground.	5	8
I don't think you're right about that.	5	8
Oh, I'm positive.	5	8
Forget it.	5	8
I'll leave that to you and your sleepless nights.	5	8
I'm surprised you're not doing better.	5	8
- You like my new tie? - Yes.	5	8
 You know what a new tie means?	5	8
It means I have a spectacular new side dish in the city.	5	8
Strawberry blonde. Tiny thing with huge tits.	5	8
Twenty-fourth floor, 24-years-old.	5	8
I got an apartment.	5	8
What's your wife saying?	5	8
She's happy because I provide for her.	5	8
She's not worried about what might happen to her	5	8
if something happens to me.	5	8
Aren't you worried you're going to get caught?	5	8
I'll be right back.	5	8
I have a Jack Shapiro calling for you.	5	8
Well, for Megan Calvet.	5	8
Thank you so much, Dawn.	5	8
So shot for shot, it's A Hard Day's Night,	5	8
as these screaming girls increase in numbers	5	8
until our mop-top in the white leatherjacket	5	8
ducks into the Chevalier Blanc Pub.	5	8
Notice the white chess piece.	5	8
Then we're inside and we're in color,	5	8
but there's even more girls.	5	8
The music cuts and they stare at him	5	8
like at the end of The Birds.	5	8
"""You may have second thoughts about wearing Chevalier Blanc."	5	8
"""It's more trouble than it's worth."""	5	8
So we've been looking for a piece of music.	5	8
It really has to have that sound that the movie has.	5	8
Well, that sound is the Beatles,	5	8
who you said are impossible to get.	5	8
Oh, don't worry. There's a million bands that sound like that.	5	8
Or we'll make our own.	5	8
AII we want is the chaos and the fun,	5	8
that sort of adolescent joy.	5	8
We know what the Beatles sound like. We'll do our best.	5	8
Great.	5	8
Well, we'll get back to you on that and the schedule.	5	8
Great seeing you both.	5	8
You, too.	5	8
Make sure in the casting	5	8
that this guy is more like Calvin than Rick.	5	8
Usually you have to go to one of your finer men's rooms	5	8
to find a man like Rick.	5	8
So nothing about the applause?	5	8
It was their idea.	5	8
Now what about the song?	5	8
Like I said, there's a million of them.	5	8
Herman's Hermits, Chad & Jeremy, The Merseybeats, The Zombies.	5	8
You really think the Zombies are right? It's gotta be right.	5	8
You know what, I'll ask Megan. She'll know.	5	8
You wanted to see me?	5	8
See anything you like?	5	8
- Are you asking if I ski? - No.	5	8
I want to know which skis you want. Or take them both.	5	8
Do they explode or something?	5	8
Yes, Allen Funt sent them over.	5	8
Do you want them or not? Because they want you.	5	8
- The skis do? - Roger O'Hara took it upon himself	5	8
as head of the Head Ski Company	5	8
to demand your handling of his account over my lunch.	5	8
- Really? - Yes.	5	8
You're making quite a name for yourself.	5	8
Why are you telling me this?	5	8
Relax. It's good.	5	8
It's what I've always wanted.	5	8
Sit back, let the business roll in while you pass the jug	5	8
with some schmoe from Lutherville, Maryland.	5	8
Go on, take them.	5	8
Yes.	5	8
I suppose I will.	5	8
And I got to see that.	5	8
Where have you been hiding all day? I was about to leave.	5	8
I've been working. I thought you were, too.	5	8
Nope.	5	8
Why don't you come with me,	5	8
dress up another drab client dinner?	5	8
- Don... - Hey, let me ask you something.	5	8
When did music become so important?	5	8
It's always been important.	5	8
I mean jingles, yeah.	5	8
But now everybody keeps coming in, looking for some song.	5	8
And they're so specific.	5	8
You love specific.	5	8
But I have no idea what's going on out there.	5	8
Well, no one can keep up. It's always changing.	5	8
We're going to Danny's Hideaway.	5	8
You have to go and I have to work.	5	8
See you at home?	5	8
I promise.	5	8
You're leaving late.	5	8
Is it snowing out there?	5	8
No. Sporting goods account.	5	8
And they're already giving us presents. That's good.	5	8
They're giving me presents, and I've never even met them.	5	8
Are you a really good skier? Like famous?	5	8
Well, good night.	5	8
I thought we were working.	5	8
Don just called. I have to meet him for dinner.	5	8
Nothing I can do about that, I guess.	5	8
You can go home, too.	5	8
I don't know. They're not right.	5	8
They're exactly as you dictated them to me.	5	8
They're exactly like they're supposed to be,	5	8
but they're not it.	5	8
Maybe they are.	5	8
Go ahead.	5	8
Thanks. Good night.	5	8
- I'm sorry. - Excuse me?	5	8
You didn't happen to see Howard Dawes on the train?	5	8
Are you Beth?	5	8
Yes.	5	8
He talks about you often.	5	8
I'm sorry, he doesn't talk about anyone to me.	5	8
Peter Campbell.	5	8
We should switch cars.	5	8
I don't know how I'm gonna get these in there.	5	8
Except I locked my keys inside.	5	8
He should have been home by now,	5	8
and I'm afraid maybe he fell asleep on the train.	5	8
He's done that before.	5	8
Now that I think of it,	5	8
I saw some fellow corner him in the Oyster Bar.	5	8
He may be a while.	5	8
I can notify a locksmith for the car and the house.	5	8
Can you just drive me home?	5	8
The house is open. I'll deal with this in the morning.	5	8
Next time we turn, I'll warn you.	5	8
When's the next train?	5	8
You know what? I'll give you my number.	5	8
And when Howard calls from the station,	5	8
I'll shuttle him home.	5	8
He's not coming home. He's staying in the city.	5	8
We got an apartment.	5	8
"""We."""	5	8
You're enough of a stranger that I've never heard your name,	5	8
yet you know where he is and I don't.	5	8
I don't know anything.	5	8
Did you know that was a stop sign?	5	8
You're an awful driver.	5	8
Are you from Manhattan?	5	8
Yes. And I just learned.	5	8
I could never live in the city.	5	8
What's wrong with it?	5	8
Well, I love it, but all the hobos and the panhandlers...	5	8
There aren't that many.	5	8
Well, they always accost me.	5	8
I think it's because I make eye contact.	5	8
And then I always give them money,	5	8
and I can't stop thinking about them for the rest of the day.	5	8
Wandering around, sleeping in doorways.	5	8
When I was little, I tried to make my father give one money and he wouldn't.	5	8
"He said, ""We couldn't take care of everybody."""	5	8
I guess we're supposed to get used to not seeing them.	5	8
Yes.	5	8
That's exactly what happens.	5	8
Hello?	5	8
It's me. Is Megan there?	5	8
Isn't she with you?	5	8
Yes, we're playing a hilarious joke on you.	5	8
She left a while ago to meet you at the restaurant.	5	8
When?	5	8
I don't know. After you called.	5	8
I didn't call.	5	8
She must be at home.	5	8
I'm at home.	5	8
Maybe she went to the restaurant	5	8
and missed you and now she's on her way home.	5	8
I don't know where she is. Do you know where Abe is?	5	8
Goodbye, Peggy.	5	8
It's a lovely house.	5	8
Is it harder to lie to me now that you know me?	5	8
Howard is working, I'm sure of it.	5	8
I don't even think he'd care if I was alive or dead.	5	8
I'm sorry, but you're being very dramatic.	5	8
You drove me home. Now leave me alone.	5	8
I'm not leaving until I'm sure you're not hysterical.	5	8
You don't know what you're doing.	5	8
You just want to get back at him.	5	8
Don't you want me?	5	8
You can have me.	5	8
Are you really worried that Howard's coming home?	5	8
Hello?	5	8
Hello? Peggy?	5	8
Pizza House.	5	8
I used to be like this.	5	8
What do you mean?	5	8
Just reckless.	5	8
I can't believe that happened.	5	8
Say something.	5	8
I've had men paying attention to me since before it was appropriate.	5	8
They don't care what I say.	5	8
They just watch my lips move.	5	8
I'm listening to every word you say.	5	8
Your irises are so blue and round.	5	8
Have you seen those pictures of the earth from space?	5	8
I have.	5	8
I'll take that as a compliment.	5	8
It didn't bother you to see the earth tiny and unprotected,	5	8
surrounded by darkness?	5	8
So you don't like my eyes?	5	8
This can never happen again.	5	8
What?	5	8
No, of course. I...	5	8
No, I mean it.	5	8
- Okay. - You should get home.	5	8
I don't want to leave you here.	5	8
Why not? I'm fine now.	5	8
I'm going to have a snack and go to bed.	5	8
I don't want to leave you.	5	8
Thank you for the ride home.	5	8
- Hello. - Hi.	5	8
Where were you?	5	8
Peggy said I called you and you were going to meet me?	5	8
I went out for a drink with Joey and Troy.	5	8
Had to lie to Peggy to get out of there.	5	8
I've done that.	5	8
I'm hungry. I'm going to get some crackers or something.	5	8
- You want anything? - No.	5	8
- Good morning. - 'Morning.	5	8
I'm sorry. I had no idea he was gonna call.	5	8
It's not what you think.	5	8
Don't put me in that position again.	5	8
I cannot lie to him.	5	8
- I lost a night's work. I couldn't sleep... - Would you stop?	5	8
A friend of mine knows somebody doing an off-off-Broadway show.	5	8
I read on the weekend,	5	8
and then I got a callback last night and I didn't want to miss it.	5	8
But I didn't get it, so that's it. It's done.	5	8
Why can't you tell Don?	5	8
Tell Don I still want to be an actress?	5	8
Do you?	5	8
I know copywriting's hard,	5	8
but you're doing great.	5	8
You shouldn't give up.	5	8
I wouldn't tell you this if I didn't think you had talent.	5	8
The other day they asked me to take Stan's originals down to the printer,	5	8
and I thought all I have to do is throw these in the trash and they'll fire me	5	8
or at least they'd yell at me and I could cry enough and quit.	5	8
And then I realized they'll never fire me.	5	8
You want to quit?	5	8
I don't know. What do I do?	5	8
You know there are people killing to get this job.	5	8
You're taking up a spot and you don't even wanna do it?	5	8
I'm sorry I told you.	5	8
You didn't. I caught you.	5	8
And then you act like you want advice,	5	8
but you've obviously already made up your mind.	5	8
Because he's so easy to talk to?	5	8
Well, you can't keep lying to him.	5	8
It's so simple when it's someone else's life, isn't it?	5	8
You're right. I don't care what you do.	5	8
Phil Beachum is not just the boss, he's the head of desserts.	5	8
Head of desserts? Please tell me he's 300 pounds.	5	8
He's big, just not as big as you'd like.	5	8
Anyway, Pat Wallace loved the way you and Megan...	5	8
You know, your banter.	5	8
- Dawn, where's Megan? - She's not coming.	5	8
I'm sorry.	5	8
I was just saying how Pat Wallace loved the Mr. And Mrs. Draper bit.	5	8
And you're gonna go to the test kitchen,	5	8
taste a couple of different formulations of Cool Whip,	5	8
and maybe put on a little show to his boss,	5	8
you know, as a courtesy.	5	8
So, Don, if you could bring everybody up to speed.	5	8
Well, I don't know what anybody knows about Cool Whip.	5	8
I read a 30-page dossier	5	8
"that fails to use the words, ""Fake whipped cream."""	5	8
Because it's a non-dairy whipped topping	5	8
that comes frozen and then melts into this miracle.	5	8
Just do the bit.	5	8
Okay.	5	8
Honey, I don't even think I want dessert.	5	8
- You love dessert. - You love dessert,	5	8
and you just want me to have some so you can have some.	5	8
I made two.	5	8
- What is it? - It's Cool Whip.	5	8
- It looks like whipped cream. - Just taste it.	5	8
- Is it a topping? - Well, you can have it on ice cream like this	5	8
or on fruit or cake	5	8
orjust by itself.	5	8
- Just taste it. - So it's a dessert?	5	8
- Just taste it. - Is it sweet?	5	8
Just taste it.	5	8
"That's it. That's the line. ""Just taste it."""	5	8
People are gonna be yelling it at the TV set.	5	8
- It's adorable, right? - It's a nice twist	5	8
on the stupid husband and pushy wife because they actually like each other.	5	8
Are you going to be in the ads?	5	8
No. I tried. They're not interested.	5	8
Cool Whip's not interested or Don and Megan aren't interested?	5	8
We're not interested.	5	8
- Don't you like it? - No, I do.	5	8
Just absorbing it.	5	8
Hello?	5	8
Beth?	5	8
It's Peter.	5	8
I know who it is.	5	8
I want you to get on a train and meet me in the city.	5	8
- Anywhere. - No.	5	8
Just a minute.	5	8
What do you want?	5	8
Nothing. You came over to me.	5	8
You opened the door.	5	8
Are you still there?	5	8
Was your secretary on the line?	5	8
No. I'm at a pay phone.	5	8
You're taking away all my fears.	5	8
I mean, suddenly I don't think about the fact that you ride with my husband	5	8
on the train twice a day and that you live 20 minutes away	5	8
and I'd see your wife at the market, if I ever went.	5	8
I know, I know.	5	8
Are you sorry I called?	5	8
Just... Stop.	5	8
Enjoy the memory. Leave it alone.	5	8
I mean, fantasize about it. I will, too.	5	8
But... Don't call me again.	5	8
Don.	5	8
What's the matter?	5	8
I have to talk to you.	5	8
What's wrong?	5	8
I lied to you last night.	5	8
Okay.	5	8
I told you that I went for a drink, but I didn't.	5	8
I had a call-back for a play.	5	8
Okay. So?	5	8
I feel really bad about lying to you.	5	8
And now you're telling me.	5	8
- You do that a lot? - Audition?	5	8
- No, lie to me. - No.	5	8
- Did you get it? - What?	5	8
No. No, I didn't.	5	8
But it was incredible, Don.	5	8
I think I was pretty close.	5	8
My heart was racing.	5	8
I mean, I'm rusty.	5	8
I need to go back to class,	5	8
but I realized something.	5	8
- What? - I miss acting.	5	8
I think I gave up too easy,	5	8
and I don't even know how I stopped.	5	8
I never made a decision, that's for sure.	5	8
We can't be in the Cool Whip ad.	5	8
It's bad for business.	5	8
No. I just keep thinking	5	8
I could be on Broadway or off-Broadway	5	8
or, I don't know, films, even.	5	8
Sweetheart...	5	8
Sometimes we don't get to choose where our talents lie.	5	8
I mean, what you did with Heinz,	5	8
it took me years to be able to think that way.	5	8
Well, I can't explain it,	5	8
but I felt better failing in that audition	5	8
than I did when I was succeeding at Heinz.	5	8
Because that was about making the client happy.	5	8
Wait till you walk down the street and see the work on a wall or on TV.	5	8
That's when you feel something.	5	8
Do you know that I can't even stand going to the theater anymore	5	8
because all I feel is envy?	5	8
And I know the next thing is bitterness,	5	8
and I don't want to feel that.	5	8
Okay. So what do you want to do?	5	8
I mean, there's no guarantee.	5	8
And I'm so grateful.	5	8
This gave me so much confidence.	5	8
But I never tried as hard at acting	5	8
as I did at advertising.	5	8
And it'll never be for me what it is for you.	5	8
Look, I know it's uncomfortable for you with me there.	5	8
There's a shadow over everything.	5	8
I put you in a terrible position.	5	8
There are 20 firms that would be glad to have you.	5	8
I don't want to do it, Don.	5	8
You don't want to do it?	5	8
I'm sorry.	5	8
Since I was a little girl, it's all I ever dreamed about.	5	8
I understand.	5	8
I don't want to keep you from your dream.	5	8
You're so good to me.	5	8
So what do you want to do?	5	8
I mean, you woke me up in the middle of the night.	5	8
It's obviously some sort of emergency.	5	8
Well, I can finish up my work and then help train the new person.	5	8
You want to train somebody? No.	5	8
We'll go in tomorrow and you'll say goodbye to everybody	5	8
and we'll get you on your way.	5	8
Really?	5	8
It's what you want.	5	8
I don't know what to say.	5	8
I love you.	5	8
I love you, too.	5	8
- 'Morning. - 'Morning.	5	8
Megan's quitting.	5	8
Yes. So I think today's going to be her last day.	5	8
Okay.	5	8
How do you do this?	5	8
Do you want to have a seat?	5	8
It's not like that, Joan.	5	8
She's up for a part in a play, and even if she doesn't get it,	5	8
she's decided to go back to acting full time.	5	8
Well, I'm sure she'll be wonderful.	5	8
Do we make an announcement? Do we have a party?	5	8
What's the protocol?	5	8
Why don't we have the girls take her to lunch?	5	8
I mean, she's not disappearing, is she?	5	8
No, she's not.	5	8
Don, I'll take care of it.	5	8
There you are.	5	8
Yep, been here for a while.	5	8
Well, I wanted to tell everyone, actually.	5	8
Megan, are you okay?	5	8
I'm not going to be working here anymore,	5	8
and it's really hard to tell everybody.	5	8
Hey! Megan's talking to you.	5	8
Go ahead.	5	8
I'm so sorry.	5	8
I'm not going to work here anymore.	5	8
Did he fire you? That son of a bitch!	5	8
No.	5	8
No, I'm going back to try acting again.	5	8
- Are you kidding me? - Stan.	5	8
- No, I'd better get used to it. - I was...	5	8
- I'm gonna miss you. - Me, too.	5	8
Acting is fascinating. It's probably easier for girls.	5	8
But let me ask you, do they always give you clothes	5	8
or do you have to do it in your own clothes?	5	8
I don't know. Yes, they give you a costume.	5	8
- Shoes, too? - Yes.	5	8
Break a leg.	5	8
See you around.	5	8
I think I'm in the middle of a lot of things,	5	8
but Don told me that I was just supposed to hand it over.	5	8
Are you sure about this?	5	8
Peggy...	5	8
I've always appreciated what you've done for me,	5	8
not just yesterday.	5	8
I should see Joan.	5	8
That takes a lot of guts.	5	8
I'll tell you what takes guts...	5	8
Never having money for lunch.	5	8
She owes me, like, $15 at this point.	5	8
What am I gonna do, ask Don? Call her?	5	8
I think it's clear why she left.	5	8
- That's not why. - Well, why?	5	8
Come on, reality got her.	5	8
You work your ass off for months, bite your nails, for what?	5	8
Heinz Baked Beans.	5	8
Why are you so late?	5	8
I missed the early train.	5	8
Megan's gone. She quit. She's gonna be an actress.	5	8
Joan just told me, like, five minutes ago.	5	8
Is that so?	5	8
It doesn't shock you?	5	8
No, not really.	5	8
What about Don?	5	8
Please. They do whatever they want, even to Draper.	5	8
Well, the good news is	5	8
we don't have to look over our shoulders anymore,	5	8
wondering what she's gonna tell him.	5	8
They work it over in their minds,	5	8
turn it off and on when they feel like it,	5	8
and we're just there, waiting at attention.	5	8
It's not the way it's supposed to be.	5	8
Trudy pregnant again?	5	8
Have you seen those pictures of earth from space?	5	8
Of course.	5	8
Do they make you feel small and insignificant?	5	8
No, Jennifer does that. And I'm not small, Pete.	5	8
Don't know if you've ever heard that about me.	5	8
Save it for your convention whores.	5	8
Hey, keep it down.	5	8
I'm asking you a serious question.	5	8
I like the pictures of the earth. I find them to be majestic.	5	8
Why do they give you a glimmer of hope in the midst of rejection?	5	8
A little thread to hang on to,	5	8
a misplaced word, a suggestion of the future.	5	8
Under a court of law, it would look like an accident,	5	8
but it's not.	5	8
So we're not talking about Megan, and we're not talking about Trudy.	5	8
Why do they get to decide what's going to happen?	5	8
They just do.	5	8
So enjoy your lunch.	5	8
I'll see you after. I have to get my box.	5	8
Do you really wanna come back here and do this again?	5	8
I'll bring it home.	5	8
Thank you.	5	8
I'll see you at home.	5	8
You will.	5	8
Hey, chief, good news.	5	8
Rick from Chevalier found a song they like for the Hard Day's Night spot.	5	8
Bet it's his boyfriend's favorite.	5	8
Help yourself.	5	8
I think it works pretty well.	5	8
Not that it matters when they send it over, right?	5	8
- Are you kidding me? - Why am I listening to this?	5	8
You know we can't get the Beatles.	5	8
It's not the Beatles.	5	8
This song's, like, 30-years-old.	5	8
But it's happy and it's fun.	5	8
And Don thought it was the Beatles.	5	8
- And they like it. - Turn it off.	5	8
It's stabbing me in the fucking heart.	5	8
Why are you cursing?	5	8
- Can you excuse us? - Sure.	5	8
We're due at the test kitchen tomorrow.	5	8
And they're expecting...	5	8
What do you want to do? We can just cancel it.	5	8
We're not canceling. Tell them Megan's sick. Peggy will do it.	5	8
Sure. I'll let her know.	5	8
I wasn't expecting to see you.	5	8
Yeah, well, tonight I go home,	5	8
have dinner with the wife, everything's in balance.	5	8
You know, Howard, I talked to my office	5	8
and it turns out you were right about my policy,	5	8
so I let them set me up with a broker.	5	8
Well, why'd you do that? You didn't even give me a chance.	5	8
I'm telling you, aren't I?	5	8
I got all the paperwork at my house.	5	8
I can go home, have some supper, and stop by later.	5	8
Well, our baby's been sick.	5	8
You know, I could just stop by right now.	5	8
- Beth's a great cook. - Is she?	5	8
We missed you at Megan's lunch.	5	8
I guess you have some extra work.	5	8
No. I told her I'd rather go to my own lunch with her.	5	8
I'm not gonna lie, I did not see it coming.	5	8
I thought she would fail here.	5	8
I feel bad.	5	8
I think maybe I was harder on her,	5	8
scared her away.	5	8
Second wives, it's like they have a playbook.	5	8
I don't think she's like that.	5	8
Peggy, she's going to be a failing actress with a rich husband.	5	8
No, I think she's good at everything.	5	8
I think she's just one of those girls.	5	8
Then you had every right to be hard on her.	5	8
Did you know that he met Betty Draper doing a print ad?	5	8
Did you know she was a model?	5	8
That's the kind of girl Don marries.	5	8
Good night.	5	8
Beth? Honey?	5	8
I don't know where the hell my kids are.	5	8
Hello. You have a lovely home.	5	8
This is my friend, Pete, from the train.	5	8
He has, believe it or not, an insurance emergency.	5	8
- I really don't want to be an intrusion. - It's fine.	5	8
We've always got room for one more.	5	8
- Where are the kids? - At my mother's.	5	8
Now, don't tell me. You're...	5	8
Thirty-two.	5	8
I'll be at the Hotel Pennsylvania at 12:30.	5	8
No.	5	8
I don't want that.	5	8
Then throw it out.	5	8
Your old man died young, but in a plane crash, right?	5	8
That's right.	5	8
Howard, may I speak with you?	5	8
Where are you going?	5	8
She's got a migraine.	5	8
It's baked chicken.	5	8
- I can set a table. - I don't know.	5	8
You've got me in a little trouble here.	5	8
Don't run away.	5	8
Okay.	5	8
You shouldn't cook in bare feet.	5	8
Hello.	5	8
Don't get used to this because there is going to be a lot of crying from rejection.	5	8
No, I'll try and hold it together.	5	8
Beef bourguignon. Taste.	5	8
It's hot as hell.	5	8
I thought for sure you'd come home drunk.	5	8
Megan...	5	8
It's okay.	5	8
Do you wanna fix yourself a drink?	5	8
Don...	5	8
I love you.	5	8
You're everything I had hoped you'd be.	5	8
You, too.	5	8
They're arranged in varying degrees of sweetness,	5	8
the sweetest at the end.	5	8
It's like cheese.	5	8
You have to try the Camembert before the Gorgonzola.	5	8
And we have to use clear bowls	5	8
because everybody used to pick the blue one.	5	8
Go ahead, Sarah will take notes.	5	8
We'll start with your thoughts, Ken.	5	8
Well, I can't imagine it tasting any better than that.	5	8
Welcome to the Creative Cookery Kitchen.	5	8
You know, I always like to say you're in for a treat,	5	8
but today it sounds like we are.	5	8
How's it going? Did I miss anything?	5	8
"- They just sampled ""A."" - And?"	5	8
It's not whipped cream, but it's delicious on its own.	5	8
- Now you answer your wife, right? - What?	5	8
Listen, Phil, Don's wife is sick.	5	8
This is Peggy. She's the copywriter.	5	8
- Really? - It'll be just as good.	5	8
Go ahead.	5	8
- Honey. - Yes, dear?	5	8
I was just going to say	5	8
I don't even think I want dessert.	5	8
Well, I made two.	5	8
Don't do that.	5	8
Don't you wanna know what it is?	5	8
- It's Cool Whip. - That's right, it's Cool Whip.	5	8
Just try it.	5	8
Honey, is that really what you want?	5	8
Yes, I want you to try it.	5	8
Don't you want me to taste it?	5	8
Yes, just taste it.	5	8
Why? Is it a topping?	5	8
Yes, and you can put it on ice cream	5	8
and cake and fruit.	5	8
So it's a dessert, then?	5	8
Just try it already.	5	8
Just taste it.	5	8
Well...	5	8
- Thank you. - Thank you.	5	8
- Thank you. - A pleasure.	5	8
We'll talk soon.	5	8
I'll be right back.	5	8
I am so thirsty.	5	8
Look, I think you did great.	5	8
It wasn't what it was about anyway.	5	8
They know we're going to cast it.	5	8
"You think the actress can remember to say, ""Just taste it?"""	5	8
You didn't want to rehearse. You ran it through one time half-assed.	5	8
Look, I've done it a bunch. I knew my lines.	5	8
Do you think Megan would come back and do it in the office?	5	8
- Megan is not the problem. - You didn't want her there!	5	8
You were threatened by everything about her.	5	8
I spent more time training her than you did and eight months defending her.	5	8
Defending her? She was great at it!	5	8
She thinks advertising is stupid.	5	8
No, she thinks the people she worked with are cynical and petty.	5	8
- Listen... - I did everything right,	5	8
and I am still getting it from you.	5	8
You know what? You are not mad at me, so shut up!	5	8
I'm sorry, you can't smoke in here.	5	8
- For God's sake, are you avoiding me? - Yes.	5	8
What happened?	5	8
She's following her dream.	5	8
That's admirable.	5	8
I gotta say, I can see her as an actress.	5	8
Not that she's insincere, but, you know.	5	8
She's very sincere.	5	8
I sure as hell didn't get to choose what I wanted to do.	5	8
- My father told me. - I was raised in the '30s.	5	8
My dream was indoor plumbing.	5	8
You know what? She wants to have a baby.	5	8
This is just the beginning of her process.	5	8
I don't know. I suggested that path on our honeymoon.	5	8
She said my kids were enough.	5	8
Jane wanted a baby,	5	8
"but I thought, ""Why do that to somebody?"""	5	8
Why shouldn't she do what she wants?	5	8
I don't want her to end up like Betty.	5	8
Or her mother.	5	8
You gotta go home, let her know that there's a routine.	5	8
It'll keep you both out of trouble.	5	8
Mona's dad told me that.	5	8
I was afraid I was going to leave for class and miss you.	5	8
You said you didn't know what was going on.	5	8
I bought you the latest Beatles album.	5	8
Start with this one.	5	8
Have fun.	5	8
How is fishing competitive? Man versus fish?	5	9
- No. - Morning.	5	9
Man versus man. The weighing, the measuring.	5	9
Got to respect anything that rewards you for silence.	5	9
Come on.	5	9
Morning, all.	5	9
My mother always said good news could wait.	5	9
But I spent an hour and a half on the phone last night	5	9
with my new best friend Victor at the New York Times.	5	9
Gonna get a paper route?	5	9
No, they're doing some literary profile on hip agencies.	5	9
 Hep.	5	9
After an hour of invading the details of my life...	5	9
You shouldn't start it with the Mayflower.	5	9
Anyway, I told him to get in touch with you.	5	9
He wants to see what we've been up to.	5	9
I'll have Joan put it together.	5	9
And don't worry about an interview.	5	9
He seemed to be only interested in talking to me.	5	9
Sterling Campbell Draper Pryce. May I help you?	5	9
And this one.	5	9
That'll do it.	5	9
Peggy really got buried with Heinz.	5	9
Yes, they are mostly Mr. Ginsberg.	5	9
Look at all the great work you've done as creative director.	5	9
 Look at all these voices, all this talent.	5	9
You really should put the letter in there.	5	9
Should I? That was a year ago.	5	9
As far as the world knows, it wasn't really an ad.	5	9
It's something to talk about.	5	9
We're still suffering for it.	5	9
Might as well get something out of it.	5	9
Leave 'em.	5	9
See? Because playing with a pro makes you worse.	5	9
Makes you self-conscious.	5	9
Look, J.C., you golf with me, you're gonna win every time.	5	9
No, because I'm terrible.	5	9
Okay.	5	9
Get Max Rosenberg on the phone.	5	9
I thought your tailor was Italian.	5	9
I met him at the Javits fundraiser.	5	9
He's got a piece of business. It's a Jewish wine.	5	9
Why not bring it up at new business?	5	9
Why?	5	9
Don't you think we're capable of doing this on our own?	5	9
Mr. Campbell is very good for our business,	5	9
but this requires your finesse and, frankly, your Semitic wife.	5	9
Bert, how do you not know I'm getting a divorce?	5	9
Not Mona, Jane.	5	9
Jane and I are getting divorced.	5	9
Already?	5	9
How Jewish are they?	5	9
You know, Fiddler on the Roof, audience or cast?	5	9
The company is Manischewitz. Max will know.	5	9
You can't blink.	5	9
Try to keep your eyes open so the sting from the air comes in.	5	9
Like this.	5	9
Daddy, don't forget the colored pencils.	5	9
Whining is not gonna get you anything.	5	9
I'm crying because I need them so badly for my family tree project.	5	9
- Dinner's at 7:00? - You're gonna work all day?	5	9
It's 3:30.	5	9
- Bye, boys. - Bye-bye.	5	9
How'd you do that?	5	9
Just keep 'em wide open and think about something that makes you sad.	5	9
They're probably tying their shoes. That's what it always is.	5	9
I can't sit here all day.	5	9
I thought you could park anywhere.	5	9
Betty, I'm not an ambulance. We're double-parked.	5	9
What do you think you're doing, pal?	5	9
Okay. Jesus.	5	9
Just go get 'em. I'll circle.	5	9
The doorman said you were downstairs.	5	9
- Where's Megan? - I don't know. In the bathroom.	5	9
Hurry up, get everybody.	5	9
Bobby, Gene, Mom's here.	5	9
Come on.	5	9
We were waiting.	5	9
And they buzzed you.	5	9
Henry's double-parked.	5	9
I'm sorry. I've lost track of the time.	5	9
Don's late.	5	9
This is quite an apartment.	5	9
Thank you.	5	9
I think you've seen most of it.	5	9
- Bobby, come on. - I'll go get them.	5	9
Daddy was supposed to bring the colored pencils.	5	9
I'll buy you some. Let's go.	5	9
Okay, goodbye.	5	9
Bye.	5	9
This is irritating.	5	9
I'll see you in two weeks.	5	9
Goodbye.	5	9
A trail of Sno Balls leading to bigger sales.	5	9
A frozen machine that makes money for vendors.	5	9
Now, if it's for the customers, the kids,	5	9
do they get to work the machine?	5	9
Find out.	5	9
A snowman	5	9
on the beach.	5	9
A Sno Ball's chance in hell.	5	9
They don't melt.	5	9
They're refreshing for the damned.	5	9
They're sinful.	5	9
The Sno Ball is the sin that gets you into hell.	5	9
They're sinfully delicious.	5	9
Jesus, not bad.	5	9
Just put Gene to bed. I'll be right up.	5	9
Everyone loves the cartoons in The New Yorker.	5	9
And I thought we could do that kind	5	9
with the guy crawling across the Sahara dying of thirst,	5	9
the long beard, the tattered shirt.	5	9
Only there's four guys,	5	9
and each one has a thought bubble above him.	5	9
"""Water, water,"	5	9
"""water, Sno Ball."""	5	9
- What's the line? - Doesn't need one.	5	9
Well, if you want to stay with the New Yorkerthing,	5	9
maybe some kind of cryptic joke.	5	9
- I already have the joke. - Okay. Your turn.	5	9
As much as I hate following another comedian,	5	9
Sno Ball, because it's for kids,	5	9
demands a big, loud joke.	5	9
"""Hit me in the face with a Sno Ball"" is the tag."	5	9
And the picture is someone getting hit in the face with a snowball.	5	9
Not the drink, an actual round, white, messy snowball.	5	9
And when I say someone, I mean a cop,	5	9
school teacher with glasses, businessman, Indian chief.	5	9
Anybody kids hate. And maybe a pig.	5	9
Why a pig?	5	9
I don't know, but everybody laughed.	5	9
Great, so that's a way to go.	5	9
I agree.	5	9
Also, Sno Ball comes with its own slogan because when you think of a snowball,	5	9
there's a 90 % chance you think of its chance in hell.	5	9
Right. That's true.	5	9
So I picture this devil	5	9
with a mischievous smile on his face,	5	9
sipping a Sno Ball in front of the flames of hell.	5	9
The cup is beading with condensation.	5	9
And in your head you hear his voice,	5	9
"""Yes, even me."""	5	9
That's actually good.	5	9
I'm glad I could surprise you.	5	9
No, it's just damn impressive	5	9
you could not write for so long and come back with that.	5	9
It's good to know.	5	9
Thank you.	5	9
- It's great. - I'm working on the line.	5	9
I'll do the rest of it. That's the easiest part to change.	5	9
So let's run with both of these.	5	9
May I?	5	9
Judy Steckler, half-pound loss.	5	9
That's so good. We both had a good week.	5	9
I don't know what happened. I just wasn't that hungry this week.	5	9
Stop it. You're here. You came.	5	9
This meeting can start to define what is a good week	5	9
and a bad week in our lives.	5	9
But there are good weeks and bad weeks for thin people, too.	5	9
Coming to Weight Watchers is not just a chance	5	9
to feel better about yourself.	5	9
It's a chance to share so that if, for example,	5	9
you're someone like me, you don't stuff yourself	5	9
just to keep from telling your family your problems.	5	9
How was your week, everybody?	5	9
Betty?	5	9
Well, I had a bad week out there	5	9
after having a good week in here.	5	9
Could you stand up, sweetheart?	5	9
I, you know, had	5	9
a very trying experience.	5	9
I was in an unfamiliar place and I saw...	5	9
Felt a lot of things I wish I hadn't.	5	9
And I lost a half a pound.	5	9
And I feel like I should pat myself on the back	5	9
because it was really hard.	5	9
We always talk about our goal in pounds,	5	9
but that's not all it is, is it?	5	9
Thank you, Betty.	5	9
"Anyone else? Katherine with a ""k."""	5	9
Burke Devlin will never be a stranger in Collinsport. Just do what you're told.	5	9
But the way he looks at Vicky... I know what that means.	5	9
Who was she to him, Mr. Collins?	5	9
I've heard her name too many times.	5	9
What could that miserable schoolmarm offer him that I can't?	5	9
I'll kill myself! I will!	5	9
Who the hell is this woman?	5	9
She's a new character.	5	9
She's a cook and she's in love.	5	9
She's insane. She needs a drink.	5	9
They want you to be emotional.	5	9
You haven't even seen the show.	5	9
I've seen a soap opera. I don't think I've seen one this bad.	5	9
And isn't this supposed to be scary?	5	9
I didn't come for an acting lesson, but thank you for making me more nervous.	5	9
Come on, we used to laugh about this together.	5	9
You'll go in and turn that chuck into tenderloin.	5	9
You know what? It's just so easy for you from your throne on 73rd and Park.	5	9
Some of us act for a living and we wait tables when we don't.	5	9
- That's not fair. - No, it isn't.	5	9
What do you want me to say?	5	9
That I'd kill for an audition in this piece of crap?	5	9
I would. Are you happy?	5	9
Look, I'm sorry. I'm nervous.	5	9
I haven't had a job in a while and you're lucky, that's all.	5	9
I am.	5	9
I've got to go. I've got a shift.	5	9
What should I bring for Thanksgiving?	5	9
Something sweet.	5	9
Mr. Ginsberg is here to see you.	5	9
I like the connect the dots. What's it end up being?	5	9
Actually, it's reminiscent of certain experiences for some people.	5	9
Have a seat.	5	9
Michael, can you keep a secret?	5	9
Nope.	5	9
I need you to do some work for me on a prospective account.	5	9
It will involve a client dinner.	5	9
And murder.	5	9
You're not going to dinner.	5	9
What I need from you is a couple of ideas for a company called Monarch Wines.	5	9
The brand is Manischewitz.	5	9
- You assume that I'm Jewish. - Stop talking.	5	9
They make wine for Jews.	5	9
And now they're making one they want to sell to normal people.	5	9
You know what I mean, people like me.	5	9
I think they're open to anything,	5	9
but it has to be cheap, surprise, but impactful.	5	9
Bring me a couple of your best by sundown Friday.	5	9
I have done a little research.	5	9
You know, I work for the agency.	5	9
And I don't know I want to keep a secret from Don.	5	9
You know Don. Tall guy, short temper.	5	9
For the purposes of this dinner, these are my ideas.	5	9
If it works out, Don will obviously pick you for it	5	9
and you can come up with them all over again.	5	9
Yeah, but why?	5	9
Well, Michael,	5	9
when a man hates another man very, very much,	5	9
sometimes he wants to know that something is his,	5	9
even if in the end he has to give it up.	5	9
You really do hate Campbell.	5	9
I don't devote the energy to hating people anymore.	5	9
It's for Mr. Cooper.	5	9
And what's for me? It's a lot of work.	5	9
My paying clients might suffer.	5	9
Jesus, I am bankrolling this entire outfit.	5	9
Say 100 now and 100 Monday morning.	5	9
You wipe your ass with 200 bucks.	5	9
Here, take it.	5	9
I've got to start carrying less cash.	5	9
What are you doing?	5	9
I'm sorry.	5	9
I can't eat fish five times a week.	5	9
I'm sorry.	5	9
I don't want you to go to bed hungry.	5	9
I don't do it all the time.	5	9
Couldn't sleep.	5	9
You better take it out.	5	9
Sit down. This is nice.	5	9
Don't know that it's nice that I've driven you to this	5	9
because I can't control myself.	5	9
Sweetheart, it's got nothing to do with you.	5	9
- Well, what is it? - Nothing.	5	9
I've just been putting it together that this job is a dead end.	5	9
Does Lindsay want someone else for the campaign?	5	9
Lindsay's not running.	5	9
He keeps saying that, but, you know...	5	9
Betty, I'm the one who keeps saying it.	5	9
Turns out he's the one who means it.	5	9
He wants to wait until '72, but now's the time.	5	9
Once he's out, Rocky will get the nomination.	5	9
Rocky can't run. He's divorced.	5	9
Nobody cares anymore. He just got re-elected governor.	5	9
I bet on the wrong horse, Betty.	5	9
I jumped ship for nothing.	5	9
This is a setback.	5	9
You're always thinking about other people,	5	9
and then you're angry because no one's thinking about you.	5	9
But I am.	5	9
It's so easy to blame our problems on others,	5	9
but really we're in charge of ourselves.	5	9
And I'm here to help you,	5	9
as you're here to help me.	5	9
We'll figure out what's next.	5	9
What time is it?	5	9
Midnight, I think.	5	9
Can I count it as tomorrow?	5	9
Okay.	5	9
Now.	5	9
Hello?	5	9
Hello.	5	9
What do you want?	5	9
I want to have dinner.	5	9
Is that a good idea?	5	9
You know what, Jane? When we took LSD,	5	9
you swore to me that you would always be there for me.	5	9
Stop telling me things I said that night.	5	9
Like I know I didn't promise to remarry right away	5	9
just to save you alimony.	5	9
No, this is true. And I have a very painless exercise,	5	9
which is taking some extremely important clients to dinner	5	9
and having you on my arm.	5	9
Why don't you ask Joanie? She's a professional something.	5	9
Because they're dying to meet you.	5	9
You'd like them. It's a dinner.	5	9
I'll owe you.	5	9
I want you to buy me a new apartment.	5	9
What's wrong with the one you're in?	5	9
Your mother is my landlord.	5	9
And honestly, it has a lot of memories and it's painful to be here.	5	9
And I feel like I can't start a new life until I start a new life.	5	9
This is the most expensive dinner in history.	5	9
Really? Because I found the perfect one.	5	9
Well, you're lucky I called, then.	5	9
Fine.	5	9
Have your lawyer tell my lawyer what time dinner is.	5	9
I don't know, I feel like one of us should say thank you.	5	9
Thank you.	5	9
What are you doing here?	5	9
You can't be here.	5	9
I missed you.	5	9
And I kept thinking about you.	5	9
I thought you were done with me.	5	9
I forgot you.	5	9
And then I saw you in the New York Times Sunday magazine.	5	9
Can I go watch TV?	5	9
Did you finish everything?	5	9
Yeah. You can check it.	5	9
Yeah? I just might do that.	5	9
My God, are you still working on the tree?	5	9
AII they care about is the names.	5	9
Well, I have questions. Do Megan and Henry get branches?	5	9
Of course. They get a branch off of us because we're your parents.	5	9
What is this mess?	5	9
You carry this around with you every day?	5	9
This goes in your math folder.	5	9
This goes in your spelling.	5	9
Is this what you're doing in class?	5	9
No, I made it at Daddy's.	5	9
Well, it's very nice,	5	9
although I don't know why he's smiling.	5	9
"""Lovely Megan,"	5	9
"""I went to buy a light bulb."	5	9
"""When I get back, I'll see you better."	5	9
"""Love, Don."""	5	9
Everything looks good.	5	9
I'll take care of this. You can go.	5	9
You know what? Don't forget your Daddy's first wife.	5	9
You're right here. Elizabeth Hofstadt Francis.	5	9
No, your father had another wife before me.	5	9
He did?	5	9
I'm surprised he didn't tell you that.	5	9
Megan helped me.	5	9
Just put it down. It's Anna Draper.	5	9
She's deceased.	5	9
And turn it in already. I don't want another call from school.	5	9
Who is she?	5	9
I don't know why Megan didn't tell you. Ask her.	5	9
Okay.	5	9
I've got an office just across the ladies' room	5	9
from the insurance company next door.	5	9
- At least you're over here. - I'm the head of my department.	5	9
And I've been working very hard and doing very well	5	9
and nothing has changed here. It's a lot of empty promises.	5	9
What were you promised?	5	9
Hello.	5	9
It's a mess in there.	5	9
Both campaigns draw you in, but in different ways. This one's a series.	5	9
If Harry rolls it out right, you wonder who's gonna get hit next.	5	9
That's great.	5	9
And this one pulls you in as you hear the evil voice inside your head.	5	9
"""This could change everything."""	5	9
I think the devil is clever.	5	9
Snowball's chance in hell and so forth.	5	9
But I think the getting hit in the face has a loud, juvenile quality	5	9
that makes a Sno Ball seem more fun than a soft drink.	5	9
Also, they kept talking about refreshing,	5	9
and this one is literally a slap in the face.	5	9
The devil could be a series, too.	5	9
We could see what he's up to in different situations.	5	9
And it's got the heat that Warren talked about for thirst.	5	9
This one's funnier.	5	9
Let's lead with that one and take them both.	5	9
- Great. - Funny stuff. Really good work.	5	9
- Thank you. - Thank you.	5	9
I've got drinks.	5	9
- Take these to full color. - Absolutely.	5	9
- What time is it? - Bye, creative.	5	9
"""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair."""	5	9
You should read the rest of that poem, you boob.	5	9
Come on. Here.	5	9
Bye-bye.	5	9
Sally?	5	9
Sally.	5	9
Bye.	5	9
Have fun.	5	9
Come on. Let's go.	5	9
Do you want me to make you something? You haven't eaten.	5	9
I told you I don't want anything.	5	9
Why are you being so nasty today?	5	9
Because you're a phony.	5	9
You don't talk to me like that.	5	9
Who is Anna?	5	9
What?	5	9
You acted like you were friends with me. But you really do whatever he says.	5	9
And guess what?	5	9
You're not special. And neither was Anna.	5	9
Where did you hear that?	5	9
You were my friend first.	5	9
Who told you about her?	5	9
Someone who doesn't lie.	5	9
Someone who didn't just pretend to care about my school project.	5	9
Sally, listen to me. I wasn't lying.	5	9
I just... I didn't think it was my place to say.	5	9
Everybody knows.	5	9
You're a little girl. And it's complicated.	5	9
Fine, just keep digging yourself deeper.	5	9
I don't know what your mother told you,	5	9
but your father and Anna got married to help each other.	5	9
They never lived together and they never had any babies. Honest.	5	9
So why did he marry her?	5	9
It was a long time ago.	5	9
And back then it was the only way to help each other out.	5	9
So why did he marry you?	5	9
- Talk to your father. - I don't want to.	5	9
And don't tell him I asked. I mean it.	5	9
Are you going to make yourself cry?	5	9
I am your friend, you know.	5	9
Judy Steckler... May I?	5	9
Lost a full pound.	5	9
Good.	5	9
What a nice way to end things.	5	9
I don't know what happened.	5	9
No, it's good.	5	9
Betty, you know maintaining is better than gaining.	5	9
It wasn't even a full week.	5	9
Now everyone deserves a round of applause.	5	9
You came on a Saturday.	5	9
This is the best thing you can do with the challenge of Thanksgiving ahead.	5	9
And we know it's not just the meal.	5	9
It's the cooking, right?	5	9
You have to taste everything.	5	9
We're supposed to be thankful for this,	5	9
but the food is just a symbol of all the other things.	5	9
We should fill ourselves with our children,	5	9
our homes, our husbands,	5	9
our health, our happiness.	5	9
So who has a plan for how they're gonna handle the day?	5	9
And the day before?	5	9
And let's not forget about leftovers.	5	9
Just wanted to make sure she was asleep.	5	9
What's going on with her?	5	9
She asked me about Anna. Betty obviously told her.	5	9
- Are you kidding me? - No.	5	9
But I think I handled the situation as best I could.	5	9
Who the hell told you to say anything?	5	9
What are you doing?	5	9
Damn it, this has nothing to do with you.	5	9
Keep your voice down.	5	9
I'm not gonna let her keep getting away with this crap.	5	9
You're just gonna make it worse.	5	9
And let her keep sticking her fat nose in my business?	5	9
- Let it go. - Yeah,	5	9
and what am I supposed to say to Sally?	5	9
Nothing. I promised her I wouldn't tell you.	5	9
Jesus, who's the child here?	5	9
Get your hand off the phone.	5	9
You think this is an accident?	5	9
If you call her, you're giving her exactly what she wanted,	5	9
the thrill of having poisoned us from 50 miles away.	5	9
I'm sorry.	5	9
I didn't know what else to do.	5	9
I'm sorry about that.	5	9
I didn't think anybody'd still be here.	5	9
I'm gonna leave in a minute. You come to steal something?	5	9
Nah, I'm doing some work for Roger.	5	9
But I'm not supposed to tell anybody.	5	9
It's a wine. He's trying to reel them in.	5	9
Wants to look smart at the meeting.	5	9
And he asked you?	5	9
What can I say? I have gifts and I'm grateful.	5	9
Just so you know, he's not going to pay you if you tell everybody.	5	9
He already did.	5	9
Maybe I'll throw some of it your way if you tell me what you think.	5	9
I don't care.	5	9
Hello.	5	9
The article came out and we're not mentioned.	5	9
What?	5	9
It's a bullshit piece on the usual assholes.	5	9
He compares them to philosophers.	5	9
Hold on.	5	9
Page 52.	5	9
Hold on.	5	9
170 is the kicker.	5	9
Jesus, they look like Peter, Paul and Mary.	5	9
Why are they picking them?	5	9
I don't know and I don't care.	5	9
Maybe that's the problem.	5	9
You were the one who talked to him for an hour.	5	9
I thought he was your best friend. You obviously made no impression.	5	9
- He's a rat bastard. - You know what?	5	9
Don't wake me up and throw your failures in my face.	5	9
It's Sunday, for Christ's sake.	5	9
Sally, get back here. Boys, back to your room.	5	9
Get over here.	5	9
Do you have something you want to ask me?	5	9
No.	5	9
You do, but you thought it'd be better to ask Megan.	5	9
She wasn't supposed to say anything.	5	9
And what was she supposed to do exactly?	5	9
Not lie again.	5	9
I'm sorry.	5	9
I know it's my fault	5	9
that you even have to think about things like this.	5	9
- You're a little girl. - I'm not a little girl.	5	9
Then you should realize that your mother doesn't care about hurting you.	5	9
She just wants to hurt us.	5	9
- Are you done? - No.	5	9
Anna and I were married because of a law.	5	9
It wasn't romantic. She was a friend.	5	9
And I would have told you all about her, but she died.	5	9
Is she the woman whose house we went to in California?	5	9
The one who called you Dick?	5	9
Yes.	5	9
And I really wish you'd met her.	5	9
Now, you realize	5	9
an adult would apologize to Megan even if telling her was an accident.	5	9
Okay.	5	9
Go hang up the phone in my room.	5	9
Anything for me in there?	5	9
Why don't you have Ginsberg get your lunch?	5	9
That Mohawk work I did for you was great.	5	9
And I kept it a secret, which is more than I can say for Ginsberg.	5	9
It's Manischewitz. He was perfect for it.	5	9
I'm sick of hearing people think that way.	5	9
I'm not an airplane either. I can write for anything.	5	9
You know, in the old buildings, they used to have an executive elevator.	5	9
You are not loyal.	5	9
You only think about yourself.	5	9
Were we married? Because you're thinking about yourself, too.	5	9
That's the way it is. It's every man for himself.	5	9
Quaid's department developed Sno Ball, and he will remind you.	5	9
We've got Bob Dennison, who speaks for the local bottlers.	5	9
We'll also have Michael Lloyd and Warren Kent,	5	9
who deal with the local retailers.	5	9
- You want me to get those? - I'm not taking two.	5	9
Sally?	5	9
Sally, get in here right now.	5	9
That was Mrs. Engel.	5	9
Apparently you got an A-plus on your family tree.	5	9
She thinks you're really turning things around.	5	9
It's just a drawing.	5	9
I'm very proud of you.	5	9
You should thank Megan for her help.	5	9
She helped you, didn't she?	5	9
I guess so.	5	9
She just told me the same stuff you did.	5	9
Really? You asked her about Anna?	5	9
Yes. Daddy showed me pictures and they spoke very fondly of her.	5	9
I guess you've earned some TV.	5	9
So I pulled over to the side of the interstate	5	9
and I let him out with his luggage and everything.	5	9
He is not related to me.	5	9
Siegel's a very common name.	5	9
You wouldn't want to think everyone named Rosenberg is related to you.	5	9
I didn't want to say it.	5	9
Lord knows there's been plenty of prejudice in this country.	5	9
But growing up in Manhattan, I've always envied the humor,	5	9
the closeness, the way your people keep track of each other.	5	9
So you married your way in, huh?	5	9
I've always thought Jewish women are the most beautiful women in the world.	5	9
Now that's a sales pitch.	5	9
I'm sorry I'm late.	5	9
This is my son, Bernard.	5	9
We're still on drinks. Roger Sterling, this is my wife Jane.	5	9
Bernie.	5	9
Nice to meet you.	5	9
I'm sorry about that. I took the boat out.	5	9
- We got stuck. - Really? What kind of boat?	5	9
No, you two can discuss the details later.	5	9
My dad doesn't like yachts because last time he was on one,	5	9
he rode steerage.	5	9
And look where you are now.	5	9
I've been trying to find out what Roger thinks,	5	9
but he wanted to wait for you.	5	9
I wanted to wait for dessert, make sure you liked me.	5	9
What's not to like?	5	9
As I understand it, you're trying to get Manischewitz	5	9
into the hands of different kinds of people.	5	9
So to us, it seemed the key was, different kinds of people.	5	9
If you ever look at the side of a bus, it's a moving billboard.	5	9
The passengers can't see the ad, but everyone can see the passengers.	5	9
The idea was to put a picture of the bus seats on the side of the bus	5	9
right below the window where the real people are,	5	9
show the bottom halves of their bodies	5	9
with a case of Manischewitz under each of their seats.	5	9
So it looks like whoever's riding the bus has bought the wine.	5	9
Isn't that clever?	5	9
So you thought that up, huh?	5	9
I engaged some of our creatives ad hoc in anticipation of this dinner.	5	9
I figured even if you didn't like it, you could see what we were capable of.	5	9
I know it's good.	5	9
Do we need menus?	5	9
I do.	5	9
I'm getting the chateaubriand if someone will split it with me.	5	9
I thought you liked the crabs rangoon here.	5	9
I just had some.	5	9
So, Roger, what kind of boat do you have?	5	9
Am I the only one who can work and drink at the same time?	5	9
- What happened? - They laughed,	5	9
they bought it and we already celebrated.	5	9
I'm only here because I've got three hours left on the coast.	5	9
- Hot damn! - I knew it.	5	9
Hold on. We work our ass off and we don't even warrant a call?	5	9
Blow by blow, please.	5	9
Don pitched the hell out of it, they said it was clever.	5	9
And apparently kids like devils in cartoons, as I predicted.	5	9
Really? They didn't like the other one?	5	9
I don't know. He left it in the cab.	5	9
Are you kidding me? They never even heard it?	5	9
We made a sale. Anything else?	5	9
I'm going to order some dinner.	5	9
Sure. He's gonna be useless tonight.	5	9
So, you suddenly have no problem telling people I'm Jewish?	5	9
You going to meet Bernie?	5	9
What? No.	5	9
So you're not gonna call him in two days and tell him we're separated?	5	9
You had your chance to say who I sleep with.	5	9
You're supposed to help me land this.	5	9
So if something goes on between the two of you,	5	9
you'd better pretend you're still married.	5	9
I promise, bubala.	5	9
I'm sorry.	5	9
The least you can do is show me what the better end of this deal looks like.	5	9
- What do you mean? - The apartment.	5	9
Show it to me.	5	9
When else am I gonna get a chance?	5	9
I'm not moved in. I just got the key.	5	9
Has a lot of potential.	5	9
You think so?	5	9
I have missed you.	5	9
Roger, wait.	5	9
What?	5	9
I'm surprised you're working today.	5	9
We roll out all our business this week.	5	9
I'm just gonna spend as much time as I can with my girl	5	9
before I'm trapped with my family over the holiday.	5	9
You know what, Howard?	5	9
Why don't you spend Thanksgiving with her,	5	9
and I'll go to your house and screw your wife?	5	9
Are you kidding me?	5	9
Good luck with that.	5	9
But I guess the grass is always greener, right?	5	9
I know you saw me.	5	9
I thought you were hiding from someone.	5	9
That was a bold last-minute decision, going with your idea.	5	9
I thought it was more what they wanted.	5	9
We'll never know, will we?	5	9
Because they never heard mine.	5	9
Look, I don't like going in with two ideas. It's weak.	5	9
And you don't wanna be weak, so you picked yours.	5	9
And they bought it, which is our goal, isn't it?	5	9
What do I care? I got a million of 'em.	5	9
- A million. - Good.	5	9
I guess I'm lucky you work for me.	5	9
I feel bad for you.	5	9
I don't think about you at all.	5	9
- Good morning, Mr. Draper. - Morning.	5	9
I used the toothbrush in there. I hope it's yours.	5	9
Why did you do that?	5	9
Jesus, it doesn't belong to the dead guy, does it? It's pink.	5	9
I told you why I wanted this apartment and you ignored me.	5	9
I hardly ignored you.	5	9
Now this is no different than the last place.	5	9
Really? I think it's nicer.	5	9
Not anymore.	5	9
You ruined this.	5	9
Shit.	5	9
You get everything you want and you still had to do this.	5	9
You're right.	5	9
I don't know why I did that.	5	9
I feel terrible.	5	9
Smells good.	5	9
I just got off the phone with Julia.	5	9
She got the part.	5	9
Good for her.	5	9
She asked me to buy champagne.	5	9
And you will because you want her to be happy.	5	9
It's hot as hell in here. Turn on the air.	5	9
It's on full blast. Go get ready.	5	9
Open the door at least.	5	9
No, don't.	5	9
The radio said there's a smog emergency.	5	9
The air is toxic. I don't want that in here.	5	9
That is a good-looking bird.	5	9
Mommy, wait. We're supposed to say what we're thankful for.	5	9
She's hungry, Bobby.	5	9
No, I think it's nice.	5	9
Go ahead, buddy.	5	9
I'm thankful that I have two houses	5	9
and they're both really big and I got a new sled.	5	9
I'm thankful that I'm doing good in school.	5	9
Doing well.	5	9
I am thankful that I have everything I want.	5	9
And that no one else has anything better.	5	9
Me, too. Let's eat.	5	9
- Hello? - I apologize for the hour.	5	10
You instructed me to avoid your offices.	5	10
But we have good news.	5	10
Thank goodness.	5	10
The Hansard procedure negotiations have concluded as promised.	5	10
You need only wire the full ?2,900 by Thursday	5	10
and your slate will be clear with the Inland Revenue.	5	10
As promised?	5	10
Your promise was to extricate me from this situation altogether.	5	10
My promise was to keep you out of prison.	5	10
Thursday.	5	10
 How am I supposed to find $8,000 in two days?	5	10
That's not possible. That's no help at all.	5	10
Look, Lane, you gave Her Majesty's portion to a foreign power,	5	10
and the tax man is keen to make an example of an expatriate.	5	10
This is the very best news there could be.	5	10
You should get a pencil.	5	10
I'll give you the information.	5	10
What are you doing out here?	5	10
Business. Get back to bed, dear.	5	10
- What are you looking for? - Go back to bed this minute!	5	10
Scarlett, hold this and stand here.	5	10
No.	5	10
Mr. Kinsey called regarding lunch.	5	10
- What does he want? - I think he wants to have lunch.	5	10
 - What's wrong with him? He's very polite. - Yeah.	5	10
You should have seen him at Ken's bachelor party.	5	10
- I think he was on LSD. - Really?	5	10
"He's sort of been threatening to ""spot"" by."	5	10
Scarlett, here you are.	5	10
I'm sorry, Mr. Pryce. Do you need me?	5	10
Only in that I wanted you to direct me to Mr. Crane.	5	10
Please leave us.	5	10
I'll meet him for coffee.	5	10
I was hoping we could discuss the first quarter media projections.	5	10
Sure.	5	10
These numbers are very positive.	5	10
They're projections.	5	10
They're derived from reality, but they're hopes and dreams.	5	10
January and February look great.	5	10
Heinz, Mohawk, Vicks, all pretty stable.	5	10
When will they become commitments?	5	10
I can't predict the future, Lane.	5	10
I don't know what the Russians are going to do.	5	10
We may be living underground by Lincoln's birthday.	5	10
That's my only copy.	5	10
Hope you don't need any actual paperwork because everything's out by my desk	5	10
and my desk is out by Chuck.	5	10
How's Rebecca?	5	10
About the same, underfed and underpaid.	5	10
And Laura?	5	10
She calls me during the day and she's peachy.	5	10
But I come home and she's blue.	5	10
- To the holidays. - To gin.	5	10
So, Walt, what do you think about extending our credit by $50,000?	5	10
I didn't know we were going to talk real business.	5	10
Should I slow down?	5	10
How do things look for '67?	5	10
The projections suggest...	5	10
No projections. We're only interested in commitments.	5	10
Yes, the commitments are firm,	5	10
but no one's been paying their bills on time.	5	10
I got it. Done.	5	10
Are you going away?	5	10
No. I love Christmas in Manhattan.	5	10
Can you take care of it today? I'd like to start writing checks immediately.	5	10
Sure.	5	10
We're heading to Florida.	5	10
I want to fly, but I think we're going to drive.	5	10
- Roger, Cooper's office. - Coming.	5	10
What's the hurry, Harry?	5	10
Are you drunk?	5	10
Pearl Harbor Day. Show some respect.	5	10
How are you doing with your bombing?	5	10
Remember Lane's fool at Jaguar, Edwin Baker?	5	10
You mean Bazooka Joe?	5	10
Three weeks ago, he was replaced by Hugh Hibbert,	5	10
and we are back in the running.	5	10
- He called you? - No, I called him.	5	10
In fact, I've been working a few prospects over there for months,	5	10
waiting for Edwin to self-destruct,	5	10
and he did...	5	10
Spectacularly, apparently.	5	10
He vomited in the lap of the head of the dealers association.	5	10
Who else?	5	10
It sounds like Foote Cone, Ted Bates, D'Arcy.	5	10
Everyone who doesn't have a car.	5	10
- What is that, nine of us? - No, it's five.	5	10
And size-wise, we're the smallest,	5	10
so let's all start boning up on the wonders of Jaguar.	5	10
We have a meet-and-greet next week	5	10
and the presentations are sometime in mid-January.	5	10
That's a lot of work.	5	10
Yes. You may have to stay past 5:30.	5	10
I'd live here if I thought it was more than a pipe dream.	5	10
We reject the material world	5	10
in favor of the recognition of one's true identity.	5	10
I don't understand what you're saying.	5	10
Paul?	5	10
Harry Crane, as I live and breathe.	5	10
What the hell happened to you?	5	10
Krishna consciousness.	5	10
Don't pretend this isn't strange.	5	10
That's why I wanted you to see it.	5	10
Consider it seen. I really should be going.	5	10
Harry, I've been trying to get you down here.	5	10
Remember how anxious, how insecure, how terrified I was of living life?	5	10
It's gone.	5	10
Can you imagine living that way, Harry?	5	10
I'm sorry, this is giving me the willies.	5	10
Please, keep an open mind.	5	10
Can we do this for a few minutes?	5	10
Am I allowed to be here?	5	10
- Everyone's allowed to be here. - Hello, there.	5	10
Harry, this is Mother Lakshmi.	5	10
Hare Krishna, Harry.	5	10
- I get it. - Get what?	5	10
- I should go. - No.	5	10
Chant with us.	5	10
You'll like it. I promise.	5	10
Roger's not coming. He's on Battleship Row.	5	10
But I've already told him.	5	10
I called this meeting.	5	10
Where's Joan?	5	10
It's best Joan's not here for my announcement.	5	10
I don't know about yours.	5	10
- Go ahead. - Very well.	5	10
A recent pass of the books shows that we have	5	10
a surplus of $50,000,	5	10
and I believe that enables us to distribute Christmas bonuses.	5	10
Equal shares to full partners, half shares to juniors,	5	10
2% gifts to S.N.C. and 4% E.N.C.	5	10
God bless us, everyone.	5	10
And I shall see to it that the checks are distributed immediately.	5	10
Actually, let's wait till the Christmas party.	5	10
Someone's not going to be happy, and I'd rather not stare at her for a month.	5	10
Approved.	5	10
- Don... - I have to announce	5	10
that we're in the running... I mean, actually this time	5	10
for Jaguar.	5	10
So it's time we all get some learning on this fine automobile.	5	10
I intend to drive the Mark II this afternoon.	5	10
Don,	5	10
don't you think the bonuses would make more of an impact now?	5	10
There's nothing like a surprise for morale.	5	10
Not my morale.	5	10
The Jaguar announcement should be good for morale.	5	10
And, as much as it affects me personally,	5	10
I think we should sit tight on the bonuses.	5	10
Jaguar will provide only a little seed and we'll have to supplement.	5	10
Damn it!	5	10
We can afford to do both.	5	10
- What ghost visited you, Ebenezer? - Pete.	5	10
You asked me to stop this last time.	5	10
Yes, other than Roger,	5	10
who started drinking at exactly 7:55 this morning,	5	10
no one has given me the reaction I desire	5	10
from this blessed event.	5	10
Bert.	5	10
They're lemons. They never start.	5	10
Meeting adjourned.	5	10
You like my shirt?	5	10
It's very festive.	5	10
You know, it's sacrilege to say this,	5	10
but Pearl Harbor was an act of genius.	5	10
The only thing they didn't plan for was success.	5	10
The Japs won and they didn't know what to do with it.	5	10
Mr. Sterling,	5	10
seeing as you're dressed for fishing,	5	10
you'll have more success if you're quiet.	5	10
Don't be like that.	5	10
I couldn't care less.	5	10
I know why you're mad.	5	10
But Jane is not going to take everything.	5	10
It never occurred to me.	5	10
Because the Army is taking such good care of you?	5	10
- Have I asked? - No.	5	10
And you shouldn't have to and you don't and you keep sending it back.	5	10
Because it's a short-term solution.	5	10
- I told you, I'll cover Kevin through college. - No.	5	10
It's better this way for him.	5	10
And if you're not careful, you won't even be a family friend.	5	10
- Joanie, I had an experience. - I know, Roger.	5	10
It's not about honor.	5	10
It's about the fact that we created a human life.	5	10
We made a baby.	5	10
Yes.	5	10
And now it's some other lucky girl's turn.	5	10
Scarlett.	5	10
Hello.	5	10
All of us have a very close connection.	5	10
Krishna.	5	10
My head is humming.	5	10
And your mind is clear.	5	10
Yeah.	5	10
I should be getting back.	5	10
Holy shit, how long have I been here?	5	10
- Are you hungry? - I am.	5	10
Paramatma, take him for some food.	5	10
Yes, Mother Lakshmi. That's a beautiful idea.	5	10
- Harry, will you eat with me? - Just the two of us?	5	10
But when we are	5	10
in the material, conditional life,	5	10
we forget this.	5	10
It is so good to see you.	5	10
It's good to see you, too.	5	10
But I'm not gonna join.	5	10
I don't want you to.	5	10
But I can tell you really got into that.	5	10
I can tell you really got into Lakshmi.	5	10
I love her deeply, Harry.	5	10
Absolutely. She's my kind of religion.	5	10
It's not like that.	5	10
Lakshmi lived most of her life as a girl named Janet,	5	10
whose promiscuity led her to drugs and prostitution.	5	10
The movement saved her life.	5	10
So what's your excuse?	5	10
I was at rock bottom.	5	10
I had really degraded myself.	5	10
- At McCann? - No, damn it.	5	10
Listen,	5	10
I love what the movement has given me,	5	10
but I don't understand why I have to live like that to love God.	5	10
Are they making you stay?	5	10
It's just Lakshmi.	5	10
- So you don't wanna share, huh? - You don't understand.	5	10
I want to make a life with her, but not there.	5	10
So what does that have to do with me?	5	10
She was a runaway, and she won't leave	5	10
unless she knows she won't wind up back on the streets.	5	10
You want money. I knew it.	5	10
You know what? Go eat by yourself.	5	10
Stop, stop.	5	10
Money solves today, not tomorrow.	5	10
Up here on the right.	5	10
And for your information, Prabhupad is buying.	5	10
I'm sorry I said	5	10
I couldn't come because of the accident.	5	10
I'm sorry.	5	10
Excuse me.	5	10
"""Can you help me, doctor?"" I asked him."	5	10
"""It started... It started,"" I said,"	5	10
"""when I was sitting in front of the television set"	5	10
"""with my feet on the coffee table."	5	10
"""Now, I've sat there hundreds of times,"	5	10
"""thousands maybe, with a can of beer in my hand."	5	10
"""I like to have a can of beer in my hand when I watch the beer ads."	5	10
"""But now, for no reason I could think of,"	5	10
"""the ad was making me sick."	5	10
"""So I used the remote control to get to another channel,"	5	10
"""but each channel made me just as sick."	5	10
"""The television was one thing,"	5	10
"""and I was a person, and I was going to be sick."	5	10
"""So I turned it off"	5	10
"""and had a panicky moment."	5	10
"""I smelled the beer in my hand."	5	10
"""And as I vomited, I looked around the living room"	5	10
"""for something to grab onto."""	5	10
- Do you want something to eat? - Nope.	5	10
Come on.	5	10
I didn't have dinner.	5	10
- You want a drink? - Yep.	5	10
"""Yep. Nope."""	5	10
Should have been our wedding vows.	5	10
I'm just tired.	5	10
No, you're not.	5	10
I don't understand.	5	10
I've heard you say a lot worse things about advertising.	5	10
The mighty theater punches its audience in the face	5	10
with its subtle message. There's a challenge.	5	10
Let me tell you, people buy things because it makes them feel better.	5	10
We could have had dinner with Charles.	5	10
He's an understudy. That may be his only performance.	5	10
I don't mind picking up the check for your friends,	5	10
- but not if they insult me first. - I'm sorry.	5	10
People make fun of acting all the time, and you love it.	5	10
And I didn't think it was such a strong stand against advertising	5	10
as much as the emptiness of consumerism.	5	10
No one's made a stronger stand against advertising than you.	5	10
You know, I was scared when Bea was born, but she's such a joy.	5	10
I actually saw her face float by while I was chanting.	5	10
Really? You had a vision?	5	10
I guess.	5	10
And you kind of think you're tied to this person forever.	5	10
Not my little girl. You know, Jennifer.	5	10
And now with another one on the way...	5	10
I want a family with Lakshmi.	5	10
And a farm, maybe outside Frisco.	5	10
You're gonna have to do a little less recruiting	5	10
and a little more working.	5	10
About that...	5	10
I don't have a job for you, Paul. I've thought about that.	5	10
It's the whole reason I didn't wanna see you.	5	10
But you can help me because I have been working.	5	10
You've been writing?	5	10
I think this is the most meaningful work I've ever done in my life.	5	10
It's a speculative episode of the hit television show Star Trek.	5	10
Are you kidding me?	5	10
I think it should be their season opener next year.	5	10
If there is one.	5	10
It's a tough time slot. My Three Sons, Bewitched,	5	10
- that thing's a juggernaut. - It'll be there.	5	10
Where the hell do you watch it?	5	10
Through the window of a pizza parlor on MacDougal.	5	10
- What, do you lip-read? - I've seen the show,	5	10
and I think I've made a good effort at matching the moral complexities	5	10
tinged with adventure that draw people to it.	5	10
Just read the first 15 pages.	5	10
If you don't think it's good enough for network television,	5	10
then you don't have to pass it along to the executives at NBC	5	10
or even think about trying to get it to Mr. Roddenberry.	5	10
That's kind of a line you don't cross, Paul.	5	10
Who do you think you're talking to?	5	10
How much do you buy at NBC? You don't have any leverage?	5	10
Okay.	5	10
- Is it about Hare Krishna? - No.	5	10
Not literally, but they don't tell literal stories.	5	10
Look, you had a vision your first time.	5	10
Not that I wasn't in a state of bliss for the first few months,	5	10
but something happened.	5	10
I try to clear my head, but I can't.	5	10
It's too busy in there.	5	10
Everybody else looks so happy.	5	10
You know, I got there and I started trying to figure out	5	10
who Prabhupad likes best.	5	10
It's the same as everywhere I go.	5	10
He doesn't like me.	5	10
No one likes me.	5	10
Sometimes I think Krishna doesn't even like me.	5	10
No one but Lakshmi.	5	10
Will you read the script?	5	10
Can I ask you something?	5	10
Why didn't you bring in Paul Kinsey when you hired Ginsberg?	5	10
He wasn't submitted.	5	10
- You didn't consider him? - Was I supposed to?	5	10
As far as I know, he was at McCann,	5	10
and then Y&R, then he rolled downhill through K&E and B&B.	5	10
And last thing I heard, he was in-house at A.M.P.	5	10
Who's A.M.P.?	5	10
No, I'm sorry. The A.M.P.	5	10
Will you read a script he wrote for Star Trek?	5	10
Harry, if he asked you to pass it along,	5	10
I don't think this is what he meant.	5	10
I know what he meant, but I need a second opinion.	5	10
Aren't you curious?	5	10
"Is it going to give me a case of the ""nee-groan complex""?"	5	10
It's really bad.	5	10
"And it's pronounced ""neh-grahn"" because it rhymes with ""katahn,"""	5	10
which the negron pick under slavery to the caucasons.	5	10
That's a twist.	5	10
No, the twist is that the negron are white.	5	10
Great. Now I'm not gonna get anything done.	5	10
He really hopes this will change his life.	5	10
What am I gonna do?	5	10
You really wanna help him, don't you?	5	10
So what? Really, do you know how lucky we are?	5	10
If you really wanna help,	5	10
be honest with him and tell him he needs to write a better script.	5	10
I think it was really hard for him.	5	10
Then he shouldn't be doing it.	5	10
Mr. Campbell to see you.	5	10
Send him in.	5	10
So what's your favorite Jaguar?	5	10
Did you send over a packet?	5	10
No, I drove them.	5	10
Someone drove me.	5	10
I don't know how to operate a stick shift.	5	10
I'll go this afternoon.	5	10
See that you do, because your opinion means a lot more than mine.	5	10
Take Megan. See how they deal with a couple.	5	10
We'll see.	5	10
You know, if I told you last December that we'd be in the running for a car,	5	10
you would have kissed me on the mouth.	5	10
Maybe you and I should go as a couple.	5	10
Well, that is good to hear.	5	10
Pity having to deplete the resources this time of year,	5	10
but it had to be done.	5	10
I've been assured the funds should be accessible immediately.	5	10
Very well.	5	10
There is the matter of my fee.	5	10
Yes, of course.	5	10
After the holidays? Good day.	5	10
Joan, you have a guest in reception.	5	10
He needs a signature.	5	10
Are you Joan Harris?	5	10
Yes, that's me.	5	10
- You're served. - What?	5	10
Damn it.	5	10
Why did you let him in?	5	10
- He said he needed to talk to you. - About what?	5	10
I don't remember everything everybody says.	5	10
Because you're an idiot!	5	10
Don't talk to me like that.	5	10
Do you understand having you out here is the same as having no one?	5	10
He said he knew you. He said it was a surprise.	5	10
A surprise?	5	10
Thank you for that. Here's a surprise!	5	10
- Joan! - Surprise!	5	10
There's an airplane here to see you!	5	10
You're not allowed to do that.	5	10
- Come on. - Stop it.	5	10
- What's going on? - Nothing.	5	10
- Come with me. - I'm fine.	5	10
Don.	5	10
Come on, let's go.	5	10
It's too early for lunch.	5	10
- We're not going to lunch. - I don't even have my coat.	5	10
Look at your watch.	5	10
Well, hello.	5	10
What brings you in today?	5	10
We got tired of waiting for a cab.	5	10
Thought we'd buy a car.	5	10
Let's see if I can get out of your way.	5	10
What's this one?	5	10
It's the Mark II.	5	10
It's roomy, quiet, good for a night on the town,	5	10
but can also accommodate children.	5	10
Do you have any?	5	10
Altogether, four.	5	10
This is a car for the American road.	5	10
It's too much power for England.	5	10
They don't have the space.	5	10
Yeah, plus I hear the dampness is murder on the electrical system.	5	10
We've worked that out.	5	10
Honey. What's that?	5	10
That's the most beautiful car ever made.	5	10
The XKE, or the E-Type.	5	10
I want one.	5	10
I'm thinking about paying to have you drive around in this.	5	10
Go get me the keys. I'll drive her around for free.	5	10
I'll have to take you out one at a time.	5	10
There's no room for three.	5	10
Why would we want you along?	5	10
She really wants me to take it for a ride.	5	10
I can't.	5	10
She can drive it herself.	5	10
So you're going to ride with her?	5	10
Can I?	5	10
How much is the car?	5	10
That one?	5	10
$5,600.	5	10
Here's $6,000.	5	10
If we don't come back, consider it paid for.	5	10
I don't know what it is. That car does nothing for me.	5	10
It's because you're happy. You don't need it.	5	10
Okay.	5	10
You do not know how hard I've tried to ignore this at work.	5	10
I know what I'm doing, I have some control,	5	10
but then he found a way to ruin that, too.	5	10
You're gonna need to define some of these pronouns	5	10
if you want me to keep listening.	5	10
Dr. Captain Harris served me with papers in the office.	5	10
He's divorcing me.	5	10
Like he has the moral high ground.	5	10
It's hard on a marriage when you're apart.	5	10
Really? He loves it.	5	10
I'm sorry about that girl, but, you know...	5	10
It used to be if someone needed to see me in reception,	5	10
they were delivering flowers.	5	10
Those flowers...	5	10
God, my first week here I thought you were dating Ali Khan.	5	10
My mother raised me to be admired.	5	10
But no flowers from you.	5	10
You scared the shit out of me.	5	10
Burt Peterson told me you were the one person in the agency	5	10
I shouldn't cross.	5	10
He and Freddy had a standing argument that you were a lesbian.	5	10
You think they never brought that up with me?	5	10
Congratulations.	5	10
For what?	5	10
For getting divorced.	5	10
Nobody realizes how bad it has to get for that to happen.	5	10
Now you get to move on.	5	10
To what?	5	10
To start over? With a baby?	5	10
On what date do you share that news?	5	10
Right after you go all the way.	5	10
You'll find somebody better.	5	10
You did, didn't you?	5	10
You found someone perfect.	5	10
I did.	5	10
I feel like the office misses her.	5	10
Maybe I should have kept her at reception.	5	10
I don't think you should have thrown those papers out the window.	5	10
Give me some change. I want music.	5	10
Hello?	5	10
There's a Lakshmi here to see you.	5	10
She's got a whole story.	5	10
Bring her back.	5	10
Scarlett, please hold all my calls.	5	10
A pleasure to see you. I hope you understand,	5	10
Jennifer wants to be very thorough in our search for a nanny.	5	10
Thank you, Meredith.	5	10
If this is some kind of shakedown, let me stop you right now.	5	10
I know you're trying to recruit me.	5	10
Can I have a drink?	5	10
Isn't that verboten?	5	10
Listen to me.	5	10
I don't know what it is,	5	10
but when you were chanting, I felt this...	5	10
Intensity, you know?	5	10
Everywhere on my body...	5	10
Especially one place.	5	10
Really?	5	10
I was in such a state.	5	10
Stop it. I thought you were with Paul.	5	10
Nobody's with anybody.	5	10
Paramatma does what he wants and so do I.	5	10
It doesn't mean that we don't love each other.	5	10
So there's no reason for you to say no.	5	10
What about the fact that I'm married?	5	10
I'm burning for you.	5	10
Does your wife burn for you?	5	10
So this is completely allowed?	5	10
Take me like this.	5	10
Not even a little Sinatra?	5	10
Jimmy Durante.	5	10
Look at all these people dancing to my music.	5	10
You wanna dance?	5	10
I don't think we should.	5	10
You sure look like you wanna dance.	5	10
You and me in Midtown?	5	10
You with that look on your face?	5	10
What look, baby?	5	10
God, you're irresistible.	5	10
You know what this woman said to me once?	5	10
"""I like being bad"	5	10
"""and going home and being good."""	5	10
I bet that stuck to your ribs.	5	10
It was a disaster.	5	10
And you enjoyed every minute of it.	5	10
God, I miss that.	5	10
There's a gentleman over at seven-thirty	5	10
who looks like he wants to dance.	5	10
Who do you think he is?	5	10
Advertising?	5	10
Insurance?	5	10
Lawyer?	5	10
And who do you think's waiting at home?	5	10
I bet she's not ugly.	5	10
The only sin she's committed is being familiar.	5	10
So you think it's all him?	5	10
Because she can't give him what he wants.	5	10
Because he doesn't know what he wants,	5	10
what he's wanting.	5	10
He knows.	5	10
It's just the way he is.	5	10
And maybe it's just the way she is.	5	10
I'm gonna go.	5	10
- I can still drive, I think. - I can drive.	5	10
You can stay.	5	10
I've been sitting with you since he walked in.	5	10
Poor me, I struck out.	5	10
Who's gonna believe that?	5	10
Carfare,	5	10
in case it doesn't work out.	5	10
Mad money.	5	10
Thank you.	5	10
Good night, sweetheart.	5	10
Stand over by the jukebox.	5	10
That looked pretty good before.	5	10
Are you okay?	5	10
I don't know. I...	5	10
My heart's beating like a rabbit.	5	10
Smoking's not gonna help.	5	10
Don't get all strict on me, Mother Lakshmi.	5	10
But I am strict.	5	10
I did this for the movement.	5	10
Good to know, but I ain't joining.	5	10
Although your techniques are more persuasive than...	5	10
Paul's.	5	10
You're disgusting.	5	10
I'm only here because I don't want you shaking his devotion.	5	10
What? How does that work?	5	10
You're the worst girlfriend in the world.	5	10
And you're the best friend.	5	10
That's why you're giving him false hope for his awful teleplay.	5	10
He wants to have a life with you.	5	10
And you know that even if that was possible, that's not the way.	5	10
Look, he doesn't know that.	5	10
So why don't you just let him go?	5	10
Because he's a devotee of the Lord.	5	10
You're just a karmi and a sense enjoyer.	5	10
You wanna make him into a gross materialist	5	10
when he's living in the spiritual world.	5	10
And also he's our best recruiter.	5	10
I mean, he really can close.	5	10
So I'm confused. Why did we just do that?	5	10
Because you're going to stay away from him	5	10
and let him be happy in the light of Krishna consciousness.	5	10
You thought I was some confused little girl?	5	10
I'm trading the only thing I have.	5	10
But you already gave it away.	5	10
Stay away from him.	5	10
What do I do about the script?	5	10
Tell him the truth.	5	10
That always works.	5	10
You're drunk.	5	10
And you left work at lunch.	5	10
Where the hell were you?	5	10
You wanna get the rolling pin?	5	10
What the hell?	5	10
I wanna know where you were.	5	10
I left work, I test-drove a Jaguar,	5	10
had a drink with Joan, drove around some more and dropped it off.	5	10
And you never thought to call me?	5	10
Why did you want me to think that?	5	10
Calm the hell down.	5	10
I put a plate in the oven for you	5	10
and sat here like an idiot, waiting for someone	5	10
who doesn't give a shit about anybody.	5	10
- You like to get mad. - No, I don't.	5	10
- That's what gets you going. - That is not what this is.	5	10
Now sit down!	5	10
You're gonna eat dinner with me.	5	10
Do you want any cheese?	5	10
- No. Do you want... - I'll clean it up later.	5	10
You used to love your work.	5	10
Well, it's different there now.	5	10
You loved it before you ever met me.	5	10
My mother is not a good nurse and he hides his symptoms.	5	10
He's a rugged chap.	5	10
I do think more than ever we should pay them a visit at Christmas.	5	10
Or I could just take Nigel.	5	10
Certainly we can afford that.	5	10
I shouldn't be sharing this, but I truly don't want you to go.	5	10
You see, Edwin's left Jaguar.	5	10
That's why she left in a hurry.	5	10
If he had been sacked, he'd have lost his visa.	5	10
Yes, well, it allowed Jaguar to come crawling back to me.	5	10
The firm can't do it without me and I shan't spend another Christmas alone.	5	10
Darling.	5	10
I'm so happy for you, so proud.	5	10
Of course we'll be here by your side.	5	10
Christmas in New York will do just fine.	5	10
Don't get excited.	5	10
Well, get excited, but they're not from me.	5	10
Thank you for delivering them.	5	10
I had to. The girl in reception is too scared to bring them back.	5	10
I also had to sign for them and tip handsomely.	5	10
Do you want a tip, too?	5	10
How many times have I left you alone with a card from another man?	5	10
Hare Krishna.	5	10
Great to see you. Well?	5	10
I've been meditating on the idea that you have good news,	5	10
especially since you called me so fast.	5	10
Then I realized it's probably not, since you wouldn't tell me over the phone.	5	10
I have news, but it's complicated.	5	10
They loved it. They said it was one of the best scripts they had ever read.	5	10
Who?	5	10
The reader at Mike Weinblatt's office.	5	10
But he apparently can't give it to Mike	5	10
or anyone over there because of legal reasons.	5	10
And you can never call him because they've had some lawsuits,	5	10
but he said you have a future and I agree with him.	5	10
Did you tell him I'll get a lawyer? I'll sign anything they want.	5	10
Yes, but he was firmly discouraging in every way	5	10
except in his unbridled enthusiasm for the writing.	5	10
Really? What did he say?	5	10
Can I talk to him? Does he want to talk to me?	5	10
Never.	5	10
But...	5	10
In this envelope is your future.	5	10
This is your destiny.	5	10
Is it a contract?	5	10
They're not interested.	5	10
But I am.	5	10
This is $500 and a ticket to Los Angeles.	5	10
I want you to leave the Krishnas and go out there and try.	5	10
I don't think Lakshmi...	5	10
I'm not giving you this unless you promise	5	10
to leave your things and go from here.	5	10
I don't have any things.	5	10
Good. This is all you need.	5	10
You don't understand what it's like out there.	5	10
This failure, this life...	5	10
It'll all seem like it happened to someone else.	5	10
Harry, you don't understand Lakshmi.	5	10
If you go back there, you'll never be strong enough to go.	5	10
And then she'll try and talk you out of it. And what does that tell you?	5	10
It's $500. You can call her on the way from Philly or something.	5	10
You know, all these people said they'd do something for me.	5	10
You're the first one who did.	5	10
Break a leg.	5	10
Everyone's assembling for the announcement.	5	10
Well, there's a little bad news to go with the good.	5	10
Mohawk's machinists are going on strike.	5	10
Despite the fact that they're flying,	5	10
they're suspending their advertising.	5	10
They made so much money all summer as scabs.	5	10
- What's going on? - Mohawk's on strike.	5	10
They're suspending all work.	5	10
They're not leaving the agency,	5	10
but what they save by cutting the ad budget	5	10
goes straight to the bottom line, and it's the end of the year.	5	10
Then there'll be no bonuses.	5	10
No!	5	10
No Christmas bonuses three years in a row?	5	10
I know.	5	10
They're going to be working all through the holidays on Jaguar.	5	10
Fine. Just the partners will defer.	5	10
Even the junior partners?	5	10
Yes, till the end of January.	5	10
That's prudent.	5	10
Well, here we go.	5	10
Don, you up to joining us?	5	10
Lane, go ahead.	5	10
Well, we have a few announcements,	5	10
the first of which is	5	10
that we have received some bad news from Mohawk Airlines	5	10
that they will be suspending their work indefinitely.	5	10
This puts significant financial strain on the company.	5	10
It was our plan to distribute Christmas bonuses this year,	5	10
but quite selflessly the partners have elected to forego their share	5	10
in the interests of rewarding the staff for a job well done.	5	10
You're all getting Christmas bonuses and we aren't.	5	10
Now, understand that the financial straddling required	5	10
is for a very good reason.	5	10
We've been included in an elite group of agencies	5	10
invited to pitch Jaguar cars.	5	10
So congratulations.	5	10
Anything else?	5	10
Yes, actually, I'd like to say something.	5	10
Would you?	5	10
Last year at this time, whether you knew it or not,	5	10
the survival of this company was on the line.	5	10
I look at the faces in this room who have given their all	5	10
to this tenuous recovery and I say,	5	10
prepare to take a great leap forward.	5	10
Prepare to swim the English Channel and then drown in champagne.	5	10
There are six weekends between now and the pitch.	5	10
We are going to spend them all here.	5	10
We will celebrate Christmas here.	5	10
We will ring in the new year together.	5	10
And in the end, we will represent Jaguar, and it will be worth it.	5	10
Every agency on Madison Avenue	5	10
is defined by the moment they got their car.	5	10
When we land Jaguar, the world will know we've arrived.	5	10
Creative, in my office.	5	10
Jaguar, the mistress who'll do things your wife won't.	5	11
What did I say before?	5	11
"The client doesn't want to hear the word ""mistress."""	5	11
Salesmen can use it, but the campaign can't.	5	11
Jaguar, you'll love it when you're in it.	5	11
Are we just spitting up lines now?	5	11
You know what? Let's take a break.	5	11
Where are you going?	5	11
What was unclear about the fact that he's taking a break and we're not?	5	11
I need you to sign off on Secor Laxative.	5	11
I told you you were in charge of all ongoing business till Jaguar's done.	5	11
 - Just handle it. - Done.	5	11
- How's the prospect doing? - Is it lunchtime?	5	11
Jesus, is it?	5	11
Mr. Sterling bought lobster from The Palm.	5	11
Doesn't that sound good?	5	11
Hey.	5	11
So, I don't know what the Jaguar executives will say.	5	11
But I got dealerships in Montclair,	5	11
Englewood, Morristown, Paramus and Rutherford.	5	11
And I carry three other foreign cars.	5	11
So, frankly, creative has to be pretty spectacular	5	11
or Jaguar is just another word on the sign.	5	11
Well, then we have nothing to worry about.	5	11
The dealership on the ground floor of the corporate offices on Madison	5	11
 has done very well just having that XK-E in the entrance.	5	11
You have to be excited about this car.	5	11
Oh, it's a red-hot number. I'm excited about that.	5	11
But I'm a hard man to please.	5	11
I always feel like someone should go the extra mile.	5	11
We're open to anything your heart desires.	5	11
Well, the other day when we were all touring your offices,	5	11
our guide was a dynamite redhead.	5	11
- Joan Harris. - Built like a B-52.	5	11
Yeah, we know who you're talking about.	5	11
Well, I sure would like the opportunity to get to know her better.	5	11
Well, a lot of guys would. But, you know, she's...	5	11
She's a very interesting girl.	5	11
She's one of these free spirits? You know, open to ideas?	5	11
So you like redheads? I think I know some.	5	11
I like that redhead.	5	11
And I think she and I	5	11
would both welcome the opportunity to spend a night together.	5	11
Well, you could ask her out. It wouldn't be a conflict.	5	11
No, I'm kind of shy.	5	11
All I'm saying is, if it happens, it would make me happy.	5	11
If it doesn't, well, no guarantees in life, right?	5	11
- Get another round. I'll get it. - Absolutely not.	5	11
- Was that what I think it was? - Yes, it was.	5	11
Why didn't you just let me tell him she was married?	5	11
Because so is he. And he already knows that.	5	11
Well, we wanted to be in the car business.	5	11
- You waited up. - No.	5	11
I mean, yes.	5	11
I'm going in to read tomorrow for a really good part.	5	11
An audition? Why didn't you call?	5	11
Honestly, because I had to go to 1 Oth Avenue to get the script	5	11
and then I went and talked to Fanny,	5	11
you know, who teaches my auditioning class.	5	11
You're very good at auditions.	5	11
Not as good as the girls who get parts.	5	11
You know what? Let's talk about your day.	5	11
Well, I was gonna watch Carson and cry myself to sleep.	5	11
It'll come to you. It always does.	5	11
Unless it comes to you.	5	11
Do you really want help or you want to yell at me?	5	11
I don't know yet.	5	11
What's the strategy?	5	11
A Jaguar is beautiful, but unreliable.	5	11
It comes with a tool kit the size of a typewriter.	5	11
You basically have to own another car to go places.	5	11
So we're saying it's your gorgeous mistress.	5	11
So a wife is like a Buick in the garage.	5	11
We're trying to make a weakness into a strength.	5	11
- We're selling to men. - No, I got it.	5	11
Doesn't being a mistress make the car immoral?	5	11
"The word ""mistress"" won't be in the ad."	5	11
I don't know, but it sounds great.	5	11
I need to learn some of this.	5	11
There goes the act.	5	11
One shot, and there goes the tambourine.	5	11
You're here early.	5	11
What can I do for you?	5	11
Nothing.	5	11
Nothing, it's just, I got some bad news last night	5	11
and I was hoping you'd help me deliver it.	5	11
What happened?	5	11
Well, we were having dinner with Herb Rennet.	5	11
I think you met him the other day, from Jaguar.	5	11
- Handsome guy. - I don't remember any of them.	5	11
Well, I don't know what to do.	5	11
He basically pledged he wasn't going to back us.	5	11
Why not?	5	11
Turns out he wanted something we're not prepared to give.	5	11
Something very unorthodox.	5	11
- Good morning. - Yes?	5	11
I'm here. I'm going to get danish.	5	11
What does he want?	5	11
I feel like I shouldn't even bring this up.	5	11
In fact, I don't know how to bring this up.	5	11
But we're going to lose Jaguar unless	5	11
an arrangement is made, and it involves you	5	11
and, well, Herb.	5	11
How did that come up?	5	11
He said he was crazy about you and then he just asked.	5	11
And then I thought we were past it, but right before we put him in a cab,	5	11
he said it again and it was quite conditional.	5	11
A night with you or no vote.	5	11
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.	5	11
Anyway, if you can think of some way to break the news to the company	5	11
that we're out of this, I'd really appreciate it.	5	11
You're unbelievable.	5	11
I'm married.	5	11
How would you feel if someone asked Trudy?	5	11
I didn't bring this up. He did.	5	11
If you're not interested in the idea at all, I appreciate...	5	11
It's just...	5	11
It seems to me that there's something that could be worth the sacrifice.	5	11
We're talking about a night in your life.	5	11
We've all had nights in our lives where we've made mistakes for free.	5	11
You're talking about prostitution.	5	11
I'm talking about business at a very high level.	5	11
Do you consider Cleopatra a prostitute?	5	11
Where do you get this stuff?	5	11
She was a queen.	5	11
What would it take to make you a queen?	5	11
I don't think you could afford it.	5	11
This was an act of desperation.	5	11
I hope I haven't insulted you.	5	11
That's all that matters to me.	5	11
I understand.	5	11
Scarlett, we're ready.	5	11
Now, we can't get Ginsberg out for the call, so we want you to pretend you're his junior.	5	11
- Partner? - Supervisor.	5	11
I have Mr. Rick Swanson from Chevalier Blanc cologne on speaker.	5	11
Hi, Rick. It's Kenny.	5	11
I'm here on a speaker with Harry Crane and Peggy Olson,	5	11
Mr. Ginsberg's supervisor,	5	11
and we want to know why you want to pull the ad.	5	11
- Hello, everyone. - Hi, Rick.	5	11
Hello.	5	11
We're very happy with the work,	5	11
but sales have leveled off since the holidays.	5	11
It's Harry. And, you know, Valentine's Day is coming up.	5	11
A girl can't get a guy flowers.	5	11
Why would a woman buy a man anything for Valentine's Day?	5	11
Rick, it's Peggy.	5	11
I think you're right.	5	11
"The target of ""A hard day's night"" was men, but we can easily change that."	5	11
How do you do that?	5	11
Hello?	5	11
What if it's our leatherjacket hero	5	11
running down the street being chased by screaming girls	5	11
and instead ofjumping into a bar, he comes upon Lady Godiva on a horse	5	11
as naked as we are allowed to make her?	5	11
And he stops short, but she leans down and picks him up and puts him on the horse	5	11
and rides away with him.	5	11
What's the tagline?	5	11
It's something about how, you know,	5	11
the right woman loves Chevalier Blanc.	5	11
So it's exactly the same except for the ending?	5	11
And maybe Paris instead of London.	5	11
Ooh-la-la. A French song.	5	11
Close the door, please.	5	11
Herb Rennet has demanded to spend a night with Joan.	5	11
And I don't mean dinner and dancing.	5	11
He just came right out and said that?	5	11
Who is he?	5	11
He's the head of the Dealers Association.	5	11
And I hope you told him to take a long walk.	5	11
There's three votes. We only need two.	5	11
I thought about that.	5	11
But all he has to do is say he can't sell cars with our campaign	5	11
and neither marketing nor the factory will fight him.	5	11
- So? - So I brought up the subject with Joan.	5	11
- You what? - Now, relax.	5	11
She seemed more amused than shocked.	5	11
And it's my opinion, if we brought her the right amount...	5	11
So you thought you'd have us in here for coffee and talk about this?	5	11
What's the problem if she's amenable?	5	11
She said she'd do it?	5	11
She said we couldn't afford it.	5	11
She has a husband in Vietnam and a baby at home.	5	11
And the work will be good enough to win on its own.	5	11
- Plus, it's not a guarantee. - No, it's not.	5	11
It's a guarantee we won't get it if we don't.	5	11
You have some nerve to even ask her.	5	11
That's right.	5	11
And you should be thanking me	5	11
because we've come too far and are too close	5	11
to turning this place into what it should be.	5	11
Now we're going to walk away?	5	11
Over what?	5	11
He's one guy and we can win it without him. End of discussion.	5	11
Speaking of one guy, how does everyone else feel?	5	11
I'd love to approach her with, say,	5	11
a 10 % finder's fee on the first year's commission.	5	11
That's $50,000. A flattering amount which begs no negotiation.	5	11
I'm not going to stand in the way, but I am not paying for it.	5	11
Not even with our Christmas bonuses?	5	11
Maybe Jaguar wasn't meant to be?	5	11
I say we take our bonuses and move on.	5	11
This is a car. You cannot put a dollar figure on its significance.	5	11
Extend our credit line.	5	11
Say it's for Jaguar.	5	11
Well, why don't I look into it to see what we can afford	5	11
so you may approach her in the morning with something definitive?	5	11
So, we're 75% of this company.	5	11
There's no need to create a conspiracy by having a vote, is there?	5	11
Don't fool yourself. This is some very dirty business.	5	11
Let her know she can still say no.	5	11
You know what? We're not doing this mistress thing.	5	11
It's vulgar. We're going back to racing heritage.	5	11
- Why? - People think writers horse around	5	11
because they're coming up with ideas.	5	11
But, actually, it's because they're horsing around.	5	11
Now knock off the grab-ass and give me some lines.	5	11
And don't try to reuse these. They do not apply.	5	11
Hey, skipper. You got five seconds?	5	11
Five seconds is not enough time to sit down.	5	11
Good news. Chevalier Blanc wants to do a pool-out.	5	11
- Great. - Peggy was incredible.	5	11
She came up with this Lady Godiva bit on the spot.	5	11
But in the end, we're doing the same ad as before, but in Paris.	5	11
The guy has a beret.	5	11
Bid it out. Ginsberg should be free by then. Be nice to get him out of here.	5	11
Ginsberg? I thought of this.	5	11
- It's his account. - So I guess I'm not in charge of everything.	5	11
Jesus, Peggy, you know what?	5	11
You want to go to Paris? Here.	5	11
Go to Paris.	5	11
I'm not crying.	5	11
I didn't think that.	5	11
What, we're all suddenly interested in each other's lives?	5	11
I know for a fact that Jaguar's not going to happen.	5	11
And he probably does, too.	5	11
- I don't care. - I'll get you to Paris.	5	11
And if I don't, we'll both get out of here.	5	11
You and your stupid pact.	5	11
Save the fiction for your stories.	5	11
What can I do for you?	5	11
May I?	5	11
Signing Jaguar would be disastrous for the financial health of this company.	5	11
You have to stop being afraid.	5	11
It would be a defining moment for our business.	5	11
We don't want it that badly.	5	11
- All right, get out. - It bears discussion.	5	11
I don't know what you're talking about. Now get out.	5	11
Well, I'm sorry that there was a discussion.	5	11
But when a company is planning on spending $50,000,	5	11
there needs to be a discussion.	5	11
You were all in there talking about it?	5	11
Why does it matter if you have no intention of action?	5	11
I don't want them to know I was asked.	5	11
Roger Sterling participated in this discussion?	5	11
Yes.	5	11
He's a partner.	5	11
If you're against it, why did you tell me that number?	5	11
Sounds like a joke.	5	11
Because that may be enough money to turn your head,	5	11
and I wanted a chance to discourage you.	5	11
It is a lot of money, Lane. It's four times what I make in a year.	5	11
I suppose you wouldn't even be tempted.	5	11
Well,	5	11
if I were,	5	11
I would try to avoid the mistake that I've made my entire life.	5	11
Every time someone's asked me what I wanted,	5	11
I've never told them the truth.	5	11
And what would you want?	5	11
Three years ago,	5	11
when I was essential to the future of this firm,	5	11
I settled for much less than I needed.	5	11
The cash would only cripple the company	5	11
and would do very little to change your future.	5	11
But a partnership	5	11
yielding a 5% stake in the company itself	5	11
could take care of a woman and a child for a lifetime.	5	11
Here I thought you were trying to stop this because you have feelings for me.	5	11
That's why I'm looking out for your interests over the company's.	5	11
"""Good night, nobody."	5	11
"""Good night, mush."	5	11
"""And good night to the old lady whispering 'hush.""'"	5	11
Hey.	5	11
How's it going?	5	11
You want to help us out? Throw some taglines at the wall?	5	11
"How about, ""Jaguar, it's your problem, not mine."""	5	11
May I speak with you?	5	11
So that's Megan.	5	11
Be careful what you say. We're best friends.	5	11
So, you're wearing your audition dress.	5	11
What are you hoping I can do for you?	5	11
You noticed.	5	11
I've only bad associations with letting you leave the house in that.	5	11
There's probably 20 girls. And Julia's coming with me.	5	11
Plus, he's a fairy.	5	11
So whatever this is, it's not for me.	5	11
I want to walk in there with confidence.	5	11
I could be in a bikini and you could paint my body with spots.	5	11
Jaguar, try to tame it.	5	11
- Don't try and tame it. - Here, kitty, kitty.	5	11
So, she just comes and goes as she pleases, huh?	5	11
Ginsberg. What?	5	11
Yeah, I got it.	5	11
You can unplug that if you want.	5	11
Aren't I interrupting your routine without me?	5	11
Don't be cranky.	5	11
I was in a great mood when I left work.	5	11
Now I'm just exhausted.	5	11
So let's go to bed.	5	11
If and when we get Jaguar, I'm going to need an apartment in the city.	5	11
Absolutely not.	5	11
It's an epic poem for me to get home.	5	11
And you're dressed for bed at dinner.	5	11
Peter, let's stop playing games.	5	11
What are you talking about?	5	11
I'm tired of competing. Your love affair with Manhattan is over.	5	11
Well, how can you stand living out here in this cemetery?	5	11
There's nothing to do. There's no good night noises anywhere.	5	11
Because I want to raise my child in the fresh air.	5	11
And we should have another on the way.	5	11
I mean, it was a miracle the first time and we're not even trying.	5	11
I'm using all my energy putting my foot down.	5	11
It's 8:00. Where were you?	5	11
What's that smell?	5	11
The refrigerator is on the fritz. I had to take everything out.	5	11
Did you call someone?	5	11
His wife won't let him come here anymore.	5	11
I don't want to talk about that.	5	11
We can afford to have someone else fix the refrigerator, for God's sake.	5	11
Why won't anyone believe me? Apolo and I are just friends.	5	11
You know what? Just hire someone.	5	11
Get a colored girl in here. They're used to being bossed around.	5	11
Do whatever you want.	5	11
And what are you doing?	5	11
Drying up inside? Because of what? Greg?	5	11
I hate him.	5	11
I don't want you talking that way around Kevin.	5	11
He's a baby. He doesn't know that we all wish his father was dead.	5	11
Please, stop.	5	11
Have you been drinking?	5	11
Yes.	5	11
Sit down.	5	11
Little Murders called. Four of us got callbacks.	5	11
I'm supposed to go meet the playwright tomorrow.	5	11
That's fantastic.	5	11
- That's a big deal. - I know.	5	11
You have to promise you'll come visit every weekend.	5	11
You're going to Broadway, not jail.	5	11
No, rehearsal starts in Boston in 10 days. Oh, forget it. I'm getting ahead of myself.	5	11
Boston?	5	11
Yeah, I think there's eight weeks of rehearsals plus previews.	5	11
So you're just gonna leave for three months?	5	11
- If they want me. - Well, forget it.	5	11
What do you think this is?	5	11
You think I'm gonna be a singing waitress. Maybe put on a show in the laundry room?	5	11
I have to go to work.	5	11
You never thought about it because you didn't expect me to make it.	5	11
This is the way it works. Now you know.	5	11
Just keep doing whatever the hell you want.	5	11
Please, come in.	5	11
You didn't have to make an appointment, you know.	5	11
Yes, I did.	5	11
Tell them I want a partnership,	5	11
not silent,	5	11
comprising 5% of the business.	5	11
- Well... - There's no negotiation.	5	11
Okay.	5	11
I want documents by the end of the day.	5	11
I don't know if that's possible.	5	11
Well, I'm not guaranteeing results.	5	11
I don't think he'll have trouble performing. He's quite ardent.	5	11
I meant winning the business.	5	11
Yes, of course.	5	11
So, I have instructions, but I don't know how this works	5	11
in a practical sense.	5	11
The presentation's tomorrow, isn't it?	5	11
So I just call him and have him call you?	5	11
Probably not.	5	11
Well, how do I...	5	11
Figure something out. Do I have to do all of it?	5	11
Which one is he?	5	11
He's not bad.	5	11
He's doing this.	5	11
Come in.	5	11
I know I'm not a manager,	5	11
but it's very hard to get things done with you in another room.	5	11
Well, I obviously have the opposite feeling.	5	11
Permission to speak freely?	5	11
What?	5	11
I know you forbid us from thinking about the mistress,	5	11
but I kept imagining the asshole who's gonna want this car.	5	11
Now he's probably already got a lot of beautiful things.	5	11
Or maybe he thinks the car will help him get them.	5	11
So I can go on?	5	11
And one way or another, what he has isn't enough.	5	11
So no matter what, the first idea has got to be	5	11
finally, like, you're getting what you wanted.	5	11
The copy is still describing the car as another woman.	5	11
But a woman you can't have,	5	11
because they have all the qualities of a Jaguar.	5	11
Good-looking, expensive, fast, and, frankly, not practical.	5	11
I've always been fine with all that.	5	11
But what's the line?	5	11
"""Jaguar. At last, something beautiful you can truly own."""	5	11
So he threw the money in your face?	5	11
I don't even want to talk about it.	5	11
I've never had more responsibility. I'm on everything but Jaguar.	5	11
I worked on Plymouth at N. W. Ayer.	5	11
Car guys are a bunch of creeps.	5	11
They're all a bunch of creeps.	5	11
Could I get some more coffee?	5	11
I can never tell, ballerina,	5	11
if you're ambitious or you just like to complain.	5	11
Why can't it be both?	5	11
Well, if this was about work and not feelings,	5	11
you'd make a move.	5	11
You're right.	5	11
I could take a couple of meetings	5	11
and get an offer and throw that in Don's face.	5	11
Or you can do what everybody else does.	5	11
Have a bunch of meetings, pick a place and leave.	5	11
Don't think I haven't thought about it.	5	11
Well, you'd get to find out if you could shine elsewhere.	5	11
And I know you can.	5	11
And you'd let him know that you're not some secretary from Brooklyn	5	11
who's dying to help out.	5	11
I don't know if I can do that.	5	11
Sure, you could. You could hire a headhunter	5	11
or you could buy a friend a piece of pie.	5	11
Of course, if you do move,	5	11
you can't complain if I gave Draper a call on my own behalf.	5	11
What if Don finds out you helped me?	5	11
Don's a big boy.	5	11
If he was having this conversation with you and he wasn't the subject of it,	5	11
he'd tell you to leave in a second.	5	11
Thanks.	5	11
I've seen the campaign and it's something I couldn't have imagined,	5	11
yet exactly what I expected.	5	11
Thank you.	5	11
And I want you to present in the fullest confidence.	5	11
I think it's a winner.	5	11
Well, all I wanted to say was we've removed all other impediments.	5	11
But you do know, no matter what else goes on,	5	11
it's the creative that's going to win this.	5	11
Close the door.	5	11
It was four to zero.	5	11
You abstained in absentia.	5	11
The conversation doesn't end just because you leave the room.	5	11
What did you promise her?	5	11
A 5% stake as a voting partner.	5	11
Dawn, could you buzz Mrs. Harris?	5	11
She's not here.	5	11
Actually, Dawn, could you get my things?	5	11
Yes, you should be well rested.	5	11
I don't want it like this.	5	11
It was her idea.	5	11
Hello.	5	11
Hello. I'm Don Draper. I work with Joan. Is she in?	5	11
Yes, of course. Please come in.	5	11
What?	5	11
She'll be right with you.	5	11
- I should take your coat. - I won't be long.	5	11
Well, I will leave you two alone.	5	11
I'm really sorry to bother you if this is a bad time.	5	11
Well, I was just stepping into the shower, but how can I help you?	5	11
I wanted to tell you that it's not worth it.	5	11
And if we don't get Jaguar, so what?	5	11
Who wants to be in business with people like that?	5	11
I was told everyone was on board.	5	11
I said no and they voted when I left the room.	5	11
You're a good one, aren't you?	5	11
So you understand what I'm saying?	5	11
Yes, I do.	5	11
I'm all right.	5	11
And thank you.	5	11
So you have a nice night, and I'm gonna go prepare.	5	11
- Say good night to your friend. - Good luck tomorrow.	5	11
You must get tired of hearing what a beautiful thing this car is.	5	11
But I've met a lot of beautiful women in my life.	5	11
And despite their protestations, they never tire of hearing it.	5	11
But when deep beauty is encountered, it arouses deep emotions	5	11
because it creates a desire,	5	11
because it is, by nature, unattainable.	5	11
You look radiant, Joan.	5	11
May I call you Joan? I'm Herb, by the way.	5	11
Well, I should hope so.	5	11
We're taught to think that function is all that matters.	5	11
But we have a natural longing for this other thing.	5	11
I got you a little something.	5	11
I thought a woman with your complexion would look good in emerald.	5	11
When I was driving the E-Type,	5	11
I passed a 10-year-old boy in the back window of a station wagon	5	11
and I watched his eyes follow.	5	11
He'd just seen something he would want for the rest of his life.	5	11
I feel like a sultan ofAraby and my tent is graced with Helen of Troy.	5	11
Those are two different stories.	5	11
He'd just seen that unattainable object speed by just out of reach.	5	11
Because they do that, don't they?	5	11
Beautiful things.	5	11
You know, I don't know how much longer I can restrain myself.	5	11
Let me see them.	5	11
Then I thought about a man of some means reading Playboy or Esquire.	5	11
And flipping past the flesh to the shiny painted curves of this car.	5	11
There was no effort to stop his eye.	5	11
The difference is he can have a Jaguar.	5	11
Well, thank you for a wonderful time.	5	11
You're a hell of a gal.	5	11
Oh, this car,	5	11
this thing, gentlemen,	5	11
what price would we pay?	5	11
What behavior would we forgive?	5	11
If they weren't pretty, if they weren't temperamental,	5	11
if they weren't beyond our reach and a little out of our control,	5	11
would we love them like we do?	5	11
"""Jaguar."	5	11
"""At last, something beautiful you can truly own."""	5	11
What?	5	11
Mr. Draper is here to see you.	5	11
Why'd you tell him I was here?	5	11
He's your boss. You should see him.	5	11
Well, I will leave you two alone.	5	11
I'm really sorry to bother you if this is a bad time.	5	11
Well, I was just stepping into the shower, but how can I help you?	5	11
I wanted to tell you that it's not worth it.	5	11
And if we don't get Jaguar, so what?	5	11
Who wants to be in business with people like that?	5	11
How'd it go?	5	11
- We'll see. - It was one of his good ones.	5	11
- Come have a drink? - Maybe later.	5	11
- Where are you from? - New York.	5	11
Turn around, please.	5	11
Could you step forward, sweetheart, and turn around, please?	5	11
You know, I would have taken you anywhere.	5	11
Well, no one comes in here. The food's too bad.	5	11
We're not actually gonna eat here, are we?	5	11
I'm not hungry.	5	11
Freddy Rumsen says you are.	5	11
And so does Tom Vogel. You know we have Clearasil.	5	11
In fact, he sung your praises	5	11
while he was yelling at me that the work wasn't as good anymore.	5	11
That was my first account.	5	11
Everybody else is gonna want to know if you're married	5	11
or planning on having a baby.	5	11
And then they're gonna want to know how much you want to be paid.	5	11
But all I want to know is,	5	11
you must have heard some pretty terrible things about me	5	11
from Don Draper's mouth.	5	11
But why would you want to play for the other team?	5	11
It's not a game.	5	11
It's my career.	5	11
Look, I need a writer.	5	11
They don't have to be like me, but...	5	11
Do you know anything about Ralph Waldo Emerson?	5	11
From school.	5	11
He said that you have to be a transparent eyeball.	5	11
What he meant was, you have to take in the world	5	11
and pass it through you.	5	11
I am tired of people who treat this like math.	5	11
I looked at your book and I saw somebody	5	11
who was writing like every product was for them.	5	11
No clichés, no homilies, no formula.	5	11
Well, I had a lot of help.	5	11
Everybody does.	5	11
So I lied to you.	5	11
What do you want to get paid?	5	11
Freddy tell you to do this?	5	11
You already know you want to go.	5	11
You know how much you'll do it for.	5	11
And you didn't make me wait.	5	11
I'm going do you the same favor.	5	11
If this is your last meeting.	5	11
I think I need a chocolate shake.	5	11
First day of work ends with you and me at La Caravelle.	5	11
- You're here. - I'm here.	5	11
How'd it go?	5	11
How did yours go?	5	11
We're waiting to hear.	5	11
I bet you were great.	5	11
I bet you were, too.	5	11
- The difference is I want you to get it. - Stop it.	5	11
Well, you get to disappear for work whenever you want.	5	11
And if I have to choose between you and that,	5	11
I'll choose you.	5	11
But I'll hate you for it.	5	11
You know I don't want you to fail.	5	11
Good.	5	11
Because I'm not going to.	5	11
Don't run away like that.	5	11
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	5	11
Miss Olson wants to see you.	5	11
Peggy, come on in.	5	11
- D'Arcy's out. - Says who?	5	11
Arthur's girl told me on the QT. She said he was in his office crying.	5	11
Jaguar is calling the president of every agency.	5	11
"- Dancerjust got a big ""No, thanks."" - D'Arcy is out, too."	5	11
Get the partners in my office and wait for further instructions.	5	11
Roger Sterling's office.	5	11
I want all the partners here.	5	11
You can't leave him on hold.	5	11
Where's Pete?	5	11
Just answer it.	5	11
Hello? Hugh, how are you this morning?	5	11
I'm glad to hear that. We like him, too.	5	11
- Well, that is terrific news. - Bravo.	5	11
- This is spectacular. - Great.	5	11
We'll be over this afternoon to kiss the bride.	5	11
He said it wasn't even close.	5	11
- Well, congratulations to everyone. - We got to get champagne.	5	11
I promise you they're opening it right now.	5	11
Before everybody's too drunk, I need a list of names.	5	11
I promised them we'd staff up immediately and we're going over there today.	5	11
Can't we wait to see what the scope of the campaign will be?	5	11
Is this about the bonuses again? There are no bonuses this year.	5	11
Now, next year...	5	11
Joan, shall we address the men?	5	11
Congratulations.	5	11
You wanted to talk to me?	5	11
You're not busy?	5	11
I'm not in the mood.	5	11
You really have no idea when things are good, do you?	5	11
I swear, I don't really need to talk right now.	5	11
Drink with me.	5	11
I have to talk about something kind of serious.	5	11
I can't put a girl on Jaguar.	5	11
These car guys...	5	11
I just can't.	5	11
- But, you know... - It's not that.	5	11
Is this about Joan being made partner?	5	11
What?	5	11
The circumstances...	5	11
She's been with us 13 years.	5	11
I want you to know that	5	11
the day you saw something in me	5	11
my whole life changed.	5	11
And since then, it's been my privilege	5	11
to not only be at your side, but to be treated like a protégée	5	11
and for you to be my mentor and my champion.	5	11
But?	5	11
But	5	11
I think I've reached a point	5	11
where it's time for me to have a new experience.	5	11
Really?	5	11
I'm giving my notice.	5	11
I've accepted another offer.	5	11
- Are you done? - I'm giving the customary two weeks.	5	11
My last day will be the third.	5	11
- And don't think... - Hold on.	5	11
It's been crazy around here and I know I've been taking you for granted.	5	11
And, frankly, I'm impressed.	5	11
You finally picked the right moment to ask for a raise.	5	11
It's time for me to move on.	5	11
Come on.	5	11
I'm serious.	5	11
You're serious?	5	11
It wasn't easy.	5	11
I'm sure it wasn't.	5	11
Well, good for you. Where are you going?	5	11
Cutler Gleason and Chaough.	5	11
Perfect.	5	11
Okay.	5	11
Well, let's pretend I'm not responsible	5	11
for every single good thing that's ever happened to you,	5	11
and you tell me the number or make one up	5	11
and I'll beat it.	5	11
There's no number.	5	11
There's no number?	5	11
How long do you want to play this out?	5	11
I'm sorry,	5	11
but you know this is what you would do.	5	11
You don't need to wait until the third.	5	11
I've got a room full of freelancers out there.	5	11
I'll get by.	5	11
I understand.	5	11
Don't be a stranger.	5	11
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]	5	12
[OPERA PLAYING ON RADIO]	5	12
Buongiorno, Gino.	5	12
- Mr. Covington, you're early. - I'm not in a rush, believe me.	5	12
Don?	5	12
Jed, Jed Covington from Dancer.	5	12
Jed, nice to see you.	5	12
Please have a seat. I'm almost finished here.	5	12
Believe me, he's impossible to bother. This is a man who won Jaguar.	5	12
What is that?	5	12
It's like an expensive, unreliable Dodge.	5	12
 What, they didn't go for that?	5	12
We tried writing sexy like you did, but frankly our creative went home early.	5	12
Well, we'll see what's left of what we did after working with them for a month.	5	12
And Peter Campbell, is that his name?	5	12
Boy, were they impressed with him. This is a big win for your little agency.	5	12
So, you really eat English muffins?	5	12
Yes, but they're not English.	5	12
Well, to those of us at the 4A's, everything about you is American.	5	12
Your sense of humor, your hard work.	5	12
A lot of people join professional associations	5	12
and just use it as an excuse to drink and hand out business cards.	5	12
Well, there has been a bit of that.	5	12
There's an unelected position as head of our fiscal control committee.	5	12
We'd be honored to have you run it.	5	12
 I'm sure there are others more deserving.	5	12
Who? Fifteen months after losing Lucky Strike	5	12
to landing a car, you kept that place afloat.	5	12
- I suppose the world could see it that way. - Well, the 4A's could use a little of that.	5	12
And there's a little trip to The Greenbrier for the conference with wives or without.	5	12
Well, I suppose, I accept.	5	12
But don't expect any miracles.	5	12
Great. And don't be so modest.	5	12
JOAN: Thank you, gentlemen.	5	12
This shouldn't be longer than an hour.	5	12
Scarlett,	5	12
you have to make sure the freelance squatters are relocated	5	12
before the partners meeting.	5	12
Also?	5	12
Also there should be danish.	5	12
All partners present?	5	12
ALL: Aye.	5	12
Shall we begin with old business?	5	12
Ongoing.	5	12
Ongoing.	5	12
If I may begin, we've received a confusing request from Jaguar.	5	12
They want to explore the idea of going with a fee structure	5	12
as opposed to straight commission.	5	12
- Is there a difference? - Well, it's a very interesting issue.	5	12
In its most simplistic form,	5	12
the money we receive for work on an account is derived	5	12
from the 15% commission included in our media purchases,	5	12
plus the markup on production costs.	5	12
But under a fee structure,	5	12
the client merely pays for the work being done,	5	12
plus a negotiated one-and-a-half to 2% profit.	5	12
Well, that is interesting.	5	12
The client asked for it. That's not good.	5	12
What if Dunlop Tires wants to do that?	5	12
That's a good hypothetical. If they can get it, won't everyone want it?	5	12
Whatever it is?	5	12
It's not hypothetical. Dunlop called last night. They'd like to meet.	5	12
Well, why didn't you say something?	5	12
I was going to wait for new business.	5	12
Is it new business yet?	5	12
I don't know.	5	12
What are the billings?	5	12
A little under a million, including sporting goods and tubing.	5	12
But every Jaguar wears them.	5	12
So you know they've heard good things about us.	5	12
Incoming calls, what a welcome sound. Thank you, Mr. Campbell.	5	12
Shouldn't we have a vote on the fee versus commission question?	5	12
I already said no.	5	12
Or should I leave so you all can do whatever you want?	5	12
I move we tell them we'll look into it, and then we'll look into it.	5	12
I second that.	5	12
All in favor?	5	12
So, more new business? Back to ongoing business?	5	12
- Do we have any birthdays? - [CHUCKLES]	5	12
Is there a TV there? Tonight's Wild Wild West.	5	12
You guys will miss school and you're getting to go skiing.	5	12
I think the Wild West is very low on that list.	5	12
Now put your bowl in the sink and go get dressed.	5	12
Henry will be home in an hour. I wanna beat the traffic.	5	12
Try these. They're the biggest ones.	5	12
I don't wanna wear someone else's shoes, especially ski boots.	5	12
You know that they're sweaty. [SNIFFS]	5	12
Oh, my gosh!	5	12
Try them on.	5	12
Eleanor has smaller feet than me now.	5	12
And I'm not going skiing anyway.	5	12
You think you're going to sit in the lodge and read a book? Forget it.	5	12
I would have rather gone to school and come home and found you all gone.	5	12
Is this your plan, to ruin our ski trip?	5	12
I'm old enough that I can stay alone while you go laugh your heads off.	5	12
Fine! I'll leave you locked in a trunk.	5	12
Just let me go to Daddy's.	5	12
Do they ever take you on vacation?	5	12
Megan and Daddy took me to Disneyland where it's warm.	5	12
You want to spend the weekend there with her	5	12
because she lets you do whatever you want.	5	12
She lets me eat whatever I want.	5	12
[INTERCOM BUZZING]	5	12
DAWN: Mrs. Francis on line one.	5	12
Hello?	5	12
I wanted to know if you would have any problem with me strangling Sally.	5	12
Should we be having this conversation on the phone?	5	12
I'm not joking. She's fresh.	5	12
And I'd prefer not to have her sour puss ruining our trip!	5	12
[DOOR SHUTS]	5	12
Well, if you think killing her is the only way out of that...	5	12
We're dropping her off.	5	12
[INTERCOM BUZZES]	5	12
- DAWN: Mr. Cooper here to see you. - Send him in.	5	12
I'm gonna be busy all weekend.	5	12
It's your child bride she wants to spend time with.	5	12
Are you still asking for a favor?	5	12
I'm not asking.	5	12
We're dropping her off in an hour.	5	12
She can sleep with the doorman for all I care.	5	12
I have a question I don't know how to phrase other than as an accusation.	5	12
What?	5	12
I took it upon myself to evaluate the fee issue.	5	12
And upon examination of our books, I found this canceled check	5	12
in an unopened statement.	5	12
I'd ask you if you knew about it,	5	12
but your signature's on the check.	5	12
So it is.	5	12
I thought we agreed to forego bonuses.	5	12
- We did. - And yet you gave him one.	5	12
Bert, I'll take care of it.	5	12
You know, you can't keep being the good little boy	5	12
while the adults run this business.	5	12
Dawn, could you get Mr. Pryce in here?	5	12
[SIGHS]	5	12
[KNOCK AT DOOR]	5	12
You wanted to see me?	5	12
Close the door.	5	12
Did you hear about the 4A's?	5	12
I hope it's all right. I accepted on behalf of the firm.	5	12
What the hell is this?	5	12
Oh, this.	5	12
Uh, I remember.	5	12
I didn't sign it.	5	12
Of course you did. Right there.	5	12
You want me to play detective?	5	12
Don, we all sign a lot of things.	5	12
Is this the only one?	5	12
I won't sit here and bear this interrogation.	5	12
You want a professional to do it?	5	12
I'm giving you a chance to come clean.	5	12
Is this the only one?	5	12
How did you get this?	5	12
Cooper opened the latest bank statement and the books.	5	12
It was a 13-day loan.	5	12
But then we canceled the bonuses.	5	12
You delayed them and then you canceled them.	5	12
Then you wanted the money for Joan. And I'm the one who's committed the crime?	5	12
- Are you gambling? - No.	5	12
I owed taxes on my portfolio,	5	12
which I liquidated to put $50,000 into this firm after we lost Lucky Strike.	5	12
If you needed it so badly, why didn't you ask?	5	12
Why suffer the humiliation for a 13-day loan?	5	12
That was my money!	5	12
I'm gonna need your resignation.	5	12
[STAMMERING]	5	12
Just a moment.	5	12
I'm sorry and I am remorseful.	5	12
I don't know how it came to this, but the company's in shipshape.	5	12
And I will make good by Easter, even if I have to pull my son out of school.	5	12
You embezzled funds and you forged my signature.	5	12
I apologize deeply for involving you.	5	12
I suppose I picked you because you've always been the most decent to me.	5	12
I'm doing the most decent thing I could possibly do, Lane.	5	12
I'm letting you resign.	5	12
I have never been compensated for my contributions to this company,	5	12
including my role in its very existence.	5	12
"Who would ever have dreamt of the word ""Jaguar"", hmm?"	5	12
I took away nothing from P.P.L., while you lined your pockets.	5	12
And I have operated on a loss for three years!	5	12
Please reconsider.	5	12
I'm sorry.	5	12
I can't trust you.	5	12
I'll cover the money that you owe.	5	12
[LAUGHS]	5	12
Because 7,500 is nothing to you.	5	12
Do you know how the rest of us live?	5	12
And in the end, who's been harmed, really, hmm?	5	12
Can you imagine what would happen if a client found out?	5	12
I'll lose my visa.	5	12
I can't go back to England, not like this.	5	12
What would I tell my wife?	5	12
What would I tell my son?	5	12
You'll tell them that it didn't work out, because it didn't.	5	12
And you'll tell them the next thing will be better,	5	12
because it always is.	5	12
Take the weekend.	5	12
Think of an elegant exit.	5	12
Cooper doesn't know anything.	5	12
I feel a bit light-headed.	5	12
That's relief.	5	12
I've started over a lot, Lane.	5	12
This is the worst part.	5	12
[SIGHS]	5	12
Were you celebrating with Don?	5	12
Celebrating?	5	12
Scarlett told me about your 4A's chairmanship. Congratulations.	5	12
You look busy.	5	12
I'm thinking about taking a vacation this Easter.	5	12
Oh.	5	12
Where are we going?	5	12
Do you think there is a difference between Bermuda and Hawaii?	5	12
Well, neither is suitable for commemorating the death and resurrection of our Lord.	5	12
Can you imagine me locked in a hotel room with a baby and my mother?	5	12
I suppose you'd rather I imagined you	5	12
bouncing in the sand in some obscene bikini.	5	12
I think you should take your party elsewhere.	5	12
Well, bon voyage.	5	12
I had to get up very early this morning to go to work,	5	12
to make more money, buy you more champagne.	5	12
[LAUGHS]	5	12
Go back to bed.	5	12
She's a 25-year-old coat check girl from Long Island or Rhode Island.	5	12
She'd never had room service before. It's too easy.	5	12
Why do we do this?	5	12
For the sex, but it's always disappointing.	5	12
For me, anyway.	5	12
I don't like what we're doing.	5	12
So you're drinking with a purpose.	5	12
I'm tired of this piddly shit.	5	12
I'm tired of living in this delusion that we're going somewhere	5	12
when we can't even give Christmas bonuses.	5	12
What about your speech about how we were arriving and so forth?	5	12
Or we've arrived? I don't remember, but it was good.	5	12
So you feel different since Jaguar?	5	12
- We're getting incoming calls. - Pete is.	5	12
Look, I don't like him, but he's kind of turned things around.	5	12
He still thinks small.	5	12
Dunlop's another Topaz. It's another Mohawk.	5	12
It's another coat check girl.	5	12
- So you don't want it? - No.	5	12
I don't want Jaguar, I want Chevy.	5	12
I don't want Mohawk, I want American. I don't want Dunlop, I want Firestone.	5	12
Don't yell at me. I'd love to have Firestone.	5	12
I spent the night at the American Cancer Society	5	12
with my hand in Jim Barton's pocket	5	12
and you told me I was wasting my time. You told me he was dead.	5	12
Because Ed Baxter told me the Lucky Strike letter	5	12
poisoned us with all those companies.	5	12
What? Why didn't you tell me that?	5	12
Because I wrote that letter.	5	12
You let that wax figurine discourage you?	5	12
Why didn't you just ask me? I'll get you a meeting with Firestone.	5	12
- It doesn't mean it's not true. - Jesus, Don.	5	12
"You used to love ""no."" ""No"" used to make you hard."	5	12
And whether you admit it or not, things have changed.	5	12
You just beat out two huge firms for that shitty car account.	5	12
Caroline, get me James Barton at Firestone Tires.	5	12
No, get Ed Baxter.	5	12
Let that go.	5	12
What's Dow Chemical bill? 20 million? It's about the same size as Lucky Strike.	5	12
I'm telling you, Ed Baxter is Moby Dick. There are easier whales.	5	12
So you can't get me a meeting. They're three buildings away.	5	12
Look, I'm sure he'll meet with you.	5	12
Even if it's just to watch you eat shit, but it's complicated.	5	12
What about Kenny?	5	12
In case you've forgotten, he's squeamish about working with his family.	5	12
Then fire him.	5	12
[DOOR OPENS]	5	12
[DOOR CLOSES]	5	12
[DOORBELL RINGS]	5	12
- Hi! - [SIGHS]	5	12
What are you doing here?	5	12
My dad didn't even tell you, did he?	5	12
I'm spending the weekend here because I didn't wanna go skiing.	5	12
I thought you'd be excited.	5	12
I just didn't know. What's wrong with skiing?	5	12
I hate her so much. She's such a phony.	5	12
You know that's not true.	5	12
Can we have tea?	5	12
Go ahead and put the water out.	5	12
[PIANO PLAYING SOFTLY]	5	12
Sorry I'm late.	5	12
I don't mind waiting 20 minutes for an unspecified meeting with my boss.	5	12
I mean, it's not like your imagination would run wild.	5	12
[LAUGHS]	5	12
So we're going after your father-in-law.	5	12
I see.	5	12
Well, I've told you before, I can't help with that.	5	12
That's what I'm counting on.	5	12
What the hell does that mean?	5	12
We want the business and it has nothing to do with you.	5	12
And we'd like to keep it that way,	5	12
since you'd prefer not to jeopardize your relationship with your wife.	5	12
So what do you think's gonna happen when Ed calls me the minute you call him?	5	12
I don't know.	5	12
I suppose you could not answer the phone. You might be having a drink with your boss.	5	12
That's very smart.	5	12
I guess there's nothing I can do to muck it up now.	5	12
What the hell does that mean?	5	12
Well, I'd hate to bring it up with Cynthia, even by accident.	5	12
Look at you.	5	12
What would it take for you to do nothing?	5	12
Some kind of partnership, assuming it works out?	5	12
No, I don't want to be your partner. I've seen what's involved.	5	12
All I need is a promise that if you get it, you'll force me on it.	5	12
Okay.	5	12
You really fought us.	5	12
And two other things.	5	12
Pete doesn't go to the meeting and Pete doesn't go to any meetings.	5	12
As you were.	5	12
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]	5	12
Where are you coming from?	5	12
Hemisphere Club.	5	12
I've got good news. I talked to Ed.	5	12
- What did he say? - That he'll see you Monday morning.	5	12
Monday? Are you kidding me?	5	12
You said to get you a meeting. I got you a meeting.	5	12
You think this is a serious meeting, giving me 48 hours to prepare?	5	12
I think that's up to you.	5	12
Don't lose your nerve. I like that guy I saw today. I missed him.	5	12
[NEWS BROADCAST PLAYING ON TV]	5	12
Oh.	5	12
When did you get here?	5	12
After lunch. They couldn't wait to get rid of me.	5	12
- Where's Megan? - Taking a nap.	5	12
I love when you surprise me.	5	12
I forgot about it.	5	12
Well, don't forget Betty's not coming home until Monday afternoon,	5	12
so you can drive her out to school Monday morning.	5	12
I have a meeting. You'll have to do it.	5	12
I have an audition. I'm gonna be gone all morning.	5	12
[SIGHS]	5	12
Sally, you'll be here alone Monday morning.	5	12
Megan's got plans until lunch.	5	12
- I have school. - Not anymore.	5	12
Turn off the damn TV.	5	12
Anything else?	5	12
You don't even call me?	5	12
Do you know how insulting it is,	5	12
the assumption that I have nothing else to do?	5	12
I had to fire Lane today.	5	12
What?	5	12
What happened?	5	12
He stole money from the company.	5	12
He seems so honest.	5	12
Why would he do that?	5	12
What's the difference?	5	12
It's all just gossip at a certain point.	5	12
You can't tell anyone.	5	12
Is the firm okay?	5	12
We'll be fine.	5	12
Did you eat or just drink?	5	12
I'm not hungry.	5	12
Well, you're gonna have dinner with your daughter.	5	12
- I have a lot of work to do. - So do I.	5	12
After dinner.	5	12
What are you doing there?	5	12
We're going to dinner.	5	12
No, dear.	5	12
We're going to celebrate. More, obviously.	5	12
No, damn it.	5	12
What's gotten into you?	5	12
I've had a dreadful day, dear.	5	12
Not all of it.	5	12
I'm tired of you refusing to recognize the successes when they come.	5	12
I know your work is unpleasant sometimes, but I'm very proud of you.	5	12
You're very kind.	5	12
You obviously had a good day that turned into a bad day	5	12
and you drank too much.	5	12
But you came home to me on time.	5	12
Now you're taking me to dinner.	5	12
No arguments.	5	12
Can't we just take a cab?	5	12
I thought racing green.	5	12
- How did you get this? - I wrote a check.	5	12
I hope you're not cross. You know what? I don't care if you are.	5	12
You never spend on yourself.	5	12
It's always about my travel or Nigel's schooling.	5	12
And I told the salesman you were a partner at the car's advertising agency	5	12
and he gave me a very fair price.	5	12
Come, let's take a little drive.	5	12
It's lovely.	5	12
Go on, sit in it.	5	12
[VOMITING]	5	12
Oh, dear. You really did overdo it.	5	12
Okay, found it.	5	12
You sure you don't wanna come?	5	12
He wants to work. Look at him.	5	12
He's got a big meeting tomorrow. He'll be miserable.	5	12
You girls have fun.	5	12
REBECCA: It's cleared up.	5	12
You could just go round the block if you're still not feeling steady.	5	12
I've work to do.	5	12
I don't understand you.	5	12
Are you really going to spend your whole weekend working?	5	12
Don't you like your present?	5	12
I love the car and I love you so much, but I don't feel right driving it	5	12
until I've taken care of some of these errands I've let go.	5	12
There'll be plenty of time, dear.	5	12
You got sick from drink again yesterday. Why do you continue?	5	12
It's cognac. It settles the stomach.	5	12
Well, finish up and then we'll go for a drive.	5	12
I don't think there's really anything to see.	5	12
I was telling Sally about my plan to ensnare David.	5	12
Either way, Carter's gonna wanna rehearse with you alone.	5	12
Can I get some coffee?	5	12
I'll have some, too.	5	12
He's not gonna bring you coffee.	5	12
Uh...	5	12
Georgy Girl,	5	12
Alfie, Gambit,	5	12
Night of the Generals, Blow-up?	5	12
Anything without abortions or foreigners in it?	5	12
Let's see. Fistful of Dollars.	5	12
I think your father would kill me if I see that without him.	5	12
So, I don't understand. Do you like David or Carter?	5	12
Well, Carter likes me. Do you know what he said to me?	5	12
I can't believe I didn't tell you this. He asked if I was a redhead everywhere.	5	12
Stop! Okay?	5	12
No, it's okay. I have a boyfriend.	5	12
- Since when? - A while.	5	12
But I don't know if he likes me that way.	5	12
Then he's not a boyfriend.	5	12
A lot of great romances start out as friendships.	5	12
A boyfriend's a person that makes you feel special.	5	12
A person that knows you. And holding hands is plenty.	5	12
- You should see if you can get a drink. - I don't want a drink.	5	12
[ENGINE CHUGGING]	5	12
[ENGINE CHUGGING]	5	12
[ENGINE CHUGGING]	5	12
[SIGHS]	5	12
- Are you using the lodge phone? - SALLY: No.	5	12
I told Betty and Henry to take their ski vacation and shove it.	5	12
- Are you stuck with Bluto again? - No, I'm at Megan's.	5	12
That's better, I bet.	5	12
Actually, I'm gonna be all alone tomorrow morning.	5	12
Wanna come visit me?	5	12
Really?	5	12
You can take the train.	5	12
It's not that easy.	5	12
I've gotta sneak off campus, which is serious.	5	12
Plus, it's a 20-minute bike ride to the station and then two hours on the train.	5	12
Forget it.	5	12
For a year you've been saying how much you wanted to visit me.	5	12
Are we ever gonna see each other?	5	12
All right.	5	12
The earliest I can get to Grand Central is 8:30.	5	12
I'm gonna have to work on my paper tonight to get it typed tomorrow.	5	12
783 Park, apartment 17B.	5	12
I gotta get a pen.	5	12
[TYPING]	5	12
Do your homework, don't use the juicer, and I'll be home around 1:00.	5	12
The first thing I'm gonna do is feel that TV.	5	12
- Break a leg. - [SIGHS] Thanks.	5	12
You gonna tell me what you're gonna talk about	5	12
or is my look of surprise part of the sales pitch?	5	12
I don't want it to sound rehearsed.	5	12
No danger of that.	5	12
Just go in there and keep your cool.	5	12
But if he baits you, I want you to punch him in the balls.	5	12
- What happened to your enlightenment? - I don't know.	5	12
It wore off.	5	12
[DOORBELL RINGS]	5	12
SALLY: Just a minute.	5	12
Hey.	5	12
Come in.	5	12
You didn't check the peephole.	5	12
I knew it was you, silly. The doorman sent you up.	5	12
- You don't look that different. - Well, you do.	5	12
What do you think?	5	12
There's a kid at school whose parents have one better than this.	5	12
It has a second floor.	5	12
- What do you wanna do? - Are you kidding?	5	12
The museum's right across the park.	5	12
We don't go across the park. There's bums on the other side.	5	12
I've got money for a cab.	5	12
Okay. Let me get my jacket.	5	12
[KIDS TALKING INDISTINCTLY]	5	12
[SHUSHING]	5	12
How'd they get all these animals?	5	12
Teddy Roosevelt killed them.	5	12
Do you think they were a family?	5	12
I hope so. Otherwise, what were they doing?	5	12
"Walking around saying, ""We just need a baby to finish this diorama."""	5	12
[BOTH LAUGH]	5	12
There's this kid, Anderson, he's a senior.	5	12
He keeps picking fights with me and he's twice my size.	5	12
What a jerk.	5	12
All the senior lacrosse guys peed in my locker.	5	12
They ruined my jersey. They're a bunch of sadists.	5	12
Henry got picked on when he was little, and now he runs a city.	5	12
That's true.	5	12
I keep wishing he would leave her. I know it's wrong. I feel really bad.	5	12
Don't. You can't make it happen.	5	12
Just so you know, I could get in trouble, too,	5	12
but I really wanted to see you.	5	12
Yeah, I can't believe I almost didn't come.	5	12
My stomach hurts.	5	12
Maybe you're hungry. Want some caribou?	5	12
[LAUGHS]	5	12
Listen,	5	12
I feel kind of bad.	5	12
They were teasing me and I might have told them	5	12
that I was coming to the city to do it with you.	5	12
Really?	5	12
Yeah.	5	12
They don't know how old you are. I hope that's okay.	5	12
You can say whatever you want, but I...	5	12
I'm not sure that's the way I like you.	5	12
Yeah, good.	5	12
Yeah. I always think that you're like my little sister, except smart.	5	12
You have a mustache.	5	12
I usually shave on Sunday night. I didn't think you'd care.	5	12
I don't like it.	5	12
I really don't feel well. I'll be right back.	5	12
Okay. Meet me in Africa.	5	12
[WOMEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY]	5	12
SECRETARY: Mr. Baxter will see you now. You can leave your coats.	5	12
An hour and 45 minutes.	5	12
Better than I thought.	5	12
[CHUCKLES]	5	12
This is Tom Schafer, director of marketing. Jack Schmidt, head of household.	5	12
- Roger Sterling. - Don Draper.	5	12
[ED CLEARS THROAT]	5	12
Ed, you said they were gonna bring your son-in-law.	5	12
Ken knows better.	5	12
So, Don, what's so urgent?	5	12
I didn't say urgent. I said imminent.	5	12
Well, Ed, I wanna talk about your business.	5	12
What about it?	5	12
See, I've been looking at what you're doing	5	12
and I think you're in desperate need of change.	5	12
- And you're just the guy to do it. - I am.	5	12
Are you still the guy who wrote that letter?	5	12
I don't wanna hear about that letter again.	5	12
Do you know how hard we fought to save that account?	5	12
And they stabbed us first, believe me.	5	12
And nobody's gonna wanna be in the cigarette business.	5	12
The government's in the process of killing it.	5	12
So you're vindictive?	5	12
Not as vindictive as you, apparently.	5	12
I had a feeling this is what this was all about.	5	12
It's not. This is about your business.	5	12
Well, we appreciate that, but we're very happy with MacManus.	5	12
I'm sure they're very happy with you.	5	12
But you don't owe them anything.	5	12
All they have to do is keep running the same work.	5	12
You're on the back burner over there,	5	12
subsidizing all the great creative work they're doing	5	12
and paying for new business lunches.	5	12
As soon as you walk away, that place will fold up like a tent.	5	12
We're at 50% market share in almost everything we make.	5	12
Because you have a big line of diverse and charismatic products.	5	12
And you keep making more, Ziptape, Styrofoam, Rovana.	5	12
And why do you do that?	5	12
Because even though success is a reality, its effects are temporary.	5	12
You get hungry, even though you've just eaten.	5	12
At the old firm, we had London Fog raincoats.	5	12
We had a year where we sold 81% of the raincoats in the United States.	5	12
Name another raincoat.	5	12
But we didn't stop working for them because 81% isn't enough.	5	12
Tell me about napalm.	5	12
You mean that stuff those kids outside your building are screaming about?	5	12
Napalm was invented in 1942.	5	12
The government put it in flamethrowers against the Nazis,	5	12
impact bombs against the Japanese.	5	12
It was all over Korea. I was there. And now it's in Vietnam.	5	12
But the important thing is when our boys are fighting and they need it,	5	12
when America needs it, Dow makes it and it works.	5	12
[ED CLEARS THROAT]	5	12
But it doesn't change the fact that we're happy with our agency.	5	12
Are you? You're happy with 50%?	5	12
You're on top and you don't have enough.	5	12
You're happy because you're successful for now.	5	12
But what is happiness?	5	12
It's a moment before you need more happiness.	5	12
I won't settle for 50% of anything. I want 100%.	5	12
You're happy with your agency? You're not happy with anything.	5	12
You don't want most of it. You want all of it. And I won't stop until you get all of it.	5	12
Thank you for your time.	5	12
Thank you for stopping by.	5	12
I'll buy you a drink if you wipe the blood off your mouth.	5	12
Sally?	5	12
Sally?	5	12
HENRY: Sally!	5	12
What's going on?	5	12
She just pulled up in a cab with a $25 fare.	5	12
I got it.	5	12
Sally? Let me in.	5	12
SALLY: Is Henry out there?	5	12
No. Let me in.	5	12
I got my... My period started and I didn't know what to do.	5	12
I just wanted to come home.	5	12
It's okay. We'll take care of it.	5	12
It's okay, sweetheart.	5	12
It's okay.	5	12
I'm sorry to bother you, but can I leave these here?	5	12
Why?	5	12
Mr. Pryce hasn't come in yet and his door is locked,	5	12
and I don't feel comfortable with the company's records	5	12
parked on the edge of my desk.	5	12
Just leave them.	5	12
Please tell him to call me the minute he gets back.	5	12
Thank you, Dawn.	5	12
[DOORBELL RINGS]	5	12
- Can I help you? - Is Sally here?	5	12
She's not. Who are you?	5	12
I'm Glen. I left my bag here.	5	12
Do you know where she is?	5	12
No. I just asked you.	5	12
What is going on? What are you doing here?	5	12
I don't know, okay?	5	12
We went to the museum and she said she wasn't feeling well,	5	12
and then she just took off.	5	12
I looked for her and finally just thought, maybe she came back here.	5	12
I just need my bag, okay?	5	12
Calm down.	5	12
- When was this? - I don't know.	5	12
I was at the museum for a long time.	5	12
I really looked for her.	5	12
I didn't do anything. I just want my bag.	5	12
I would have left it, but I've got a book on Nat Turner in there	5	12
and my paper's due tomorrow.	5	12
[PHONE RINGING]	5	12
Don't move.	5	12
- Hello? - Yes, Megan.	5	12
I was just calling to say if you or Don were wondering where Sally is,	5	12
she found her way home.	5	12
[SIGHS] Thank God.	5	12
I just found out or I would have called.	5	12
What happened?	5	12
Well...	5	12
She became a woman today. She started.	5	12
Oh.	5	12
I think she just needed her mother.	5	12
No, of course.	5	12
Well, let her know that I'm glad she's okay.	5	12
I will.	5	12
What happened?	5	12
She wasn't feeling well.	5	12
- Was that Betty? - Yes.	5	12
Where are you going?	5	12
To Grand Central to get the train back to school.	5	12
I've already lost one kid today. I'll put you on the train.	5	12
Well, it doesn't leave until 7:00.	5	12
[SIGHS]	5	12
Look, just wait here, finish your paper. I'll take you later.	5	12
Do you want something to eat?	5	12
If you don't mind.	5	12
Oh.	5	12
[LAUGHING]	5	12
What's going on?	5	12
I think something's terribly wrong in Mr. Pryce's office.	5	12
I can't get the door open.	5	12
Dear lord.	5	12
Jesus.	5	12
Here.	5	12
Are you feeling better?	5	12
- I'm so embarrassed. - Don't be.	5	12
And if you ever get in trouble like that again, just ask another woman.	5	12
They'll understand.	5	12
Oh, gosh, I don't wanna talk about it.	5	12
Move over. I wanna lie down.	5	12
There's a lot of responsibilities, but that's what being a woman is.	5	12
And when it happens every month,	5	12
even though it's unpleasant,	5	12
it means everything's working.	5	12
It means everything's ready for a baby when you want one.	5	12
And maybe you'll have a beautiful girl and you can tell her all this.	5	12
[ROGER LAUGHING]	5	12
Well, I'll tell you one thing, if they haven't called the agency,	5	12
they probably called the men in white coats.	5	12
Hello?	5	12
I think you should sit down.	5	12
What's going on?	5	12
Lane hanged himself in his office.	5	12
What?	5	12
Cooper sent everybody home.	5	12
Told them there was a building emergency. Nobody knows.	5	12
What the hell happened?	5	12
Who knows?	5	12
Come on, I'm taking you home.	5	12
No, I wanna wait.	5	12
For what?	5	12
We're waiting for the coroner to cut him down and take him away.	5	12
What, he's still in there? We can't leave him like that.	5	12
They said not to disturb the body.	5	12
- It's a crime scene. - Come on.	5	12
We can't leave him like that.	5	12
Get something to cut him down.	5	12
Here, cut.	5	12
Jesus.	5	12
Come on.	5	12
Let's go.	5	12
"""To my fellow partners."""	5	12
Open it.	5	12
It's a resignation letter.	5	12
It's boilerplate.	5	12
What are you doing home?	5	12
Um, hello, Mr. Draper.	5	12
Who are you?	5	12
This is Glen. He's Sally's friend. He's waiting for his train.	5	12
Where's Sally?	5	12
She went home. I'll explain later.	5	12
I don't understand. I gotta lie down.	5	12
We've met before.	5	12
I used to live down the street in Ossining.	5	12
You know my mother, Helen Bishop?	5	12
Oh, right.	5	12
I should just go.	5	12
And sit in Grand Central until 7:00?	5	12
I'll be fine.	5	12
Where are you headed?	5	12
I go to Hotchkiss. It's up in Lakeville. It's a couple of hours away.	5	12
That's fine. Let's go.	5	12
Are you sure?	5	12
Yes.	5	12
Are you okay?	5	12
I had a bad day. We can talk about it later.	5	12
Thank you very much for your hospitality, Megan.	5	12
It was very nice to meet you.	5	12

Why does everything turn out crappy?	5	12
What do you mean?	5	12
I don't know.	5	12
Everything you wanna do,	5	12
everything you think is gonna make you happy just turns to crap.	5	12
You're too young to talk that way.	5	12
But it's true.	5	12
What do you wanna do?	5	12
If you could do anything, what would you do?	5	12

Don, you're gonna be late.	5	13
Damn it.	5	13
- Bonjour, Marie. - Would you like an omelet?	5	13
I'd better not.	5	13
You can't eat an egg?	5	13
Do I have to call the dentist?	5	13
It'll go away. It always does.	5	13
Go easy on the mouthwash.	5	13
Have fun.	5	13
Why bother him?	5	13
 With what?	5	13
"""We're sorry that there's been no response to your reel."	5	13
"""We would encourage you to try our advanced film workshop for a low..."""	5	13
What is it?	5	13
I paid for a screen test.	5	13
They were supposed to send it to agents.	5	13
And they weren't interested?	5	13
How could they have sent it to anybody but me in a week?	5	13
They're selling classes.	5	13
It's a great thing to take advantage of hopeless people.	5	13
Hopeless?	5	13
Beth, I don't know if you remember Pete Campbell.	5	13
Of course. We almost had dinner.	5	13
How was the second honeymoon? Did you create another beneficiary?	5	13
 So where are you off to?	5	13
She's gonna stay with her sister for a little bit.	5	13
And where is that?	5	13
You know what, honey? I'm going to the smoker.	5	13
- We'll have to stand. - You don't have to come.	5	13
Don't take it personally.	5	13
She's in a mood.	5	13
Excuse me. Can I just get by here, please?	5	13
- Go right ahead. - Thank you.	5	13
Morning.	5	13
-38? Where are you going? - I made a mistake.	5	13
Okay.	5	13
Because I heard that the parachute company upstairs	5	13
got a big government contract and moved to Washington	5	13
to be closer to the cemetery or something.	5	13
For once, mind your own business, Harry.	5	13
All I'm saying is if we're getting more space, I'll take anything without a column in it.	5	13
We offered you another office and you turned it down.	5	13
You didn't want his office either.	5	13
So is it true or not?	5	13
I need a window, Joan. I'm getting scurvy.	5	13
Adam?	5	13
Topaz. Always less expensive. Never cheap.	5	13
- I hate it. - No, you don't.	5	13
So we're aiming for cheap girls?	5	13
- Girl's not cheap. - So we're cheap.	5	13
Art, come on. We agreed on a value approach.	5	13
"- I hate the word ""cheap."" - And so do I!"	5	13
"That's why I put the word ""never"" in front of it."	5	13
You say the word, you put it on their mind.	5	13
I hate to quote you directly,	5	13
but didn't you say that with Topaz, a girl could be sexy for pocket change?	5	13
"I thought it was gonna be ""Two for one, twice the fun."""	5	13
That really sounds cheap.	5	13
Perhaps Don can answer this.	5	13
Gentlemen, how are you?	5	13
"Art and Marvin object to the word ""cheap."""	5	13
You're aware the word does not refer to Topaz.	5	13
Clearly it states the exact opposite. And it's very funny.	5	13
We're supposed to be part of a fantasy,	5	13
and I don't think cheap is part of any girl's fantasy.	5	13
Why don't you get a girl's opinion?	5	13
I used to take that as a given here.	5	13
And I'm not talking about black coffee out there.	5	13
- We're happy to copy test it for you. - What's that gonna cost?	5	13
They're not charging us. They should've done it already.	5	13
- Let me walk you out. - See you soon.	5	13
Why the hell didn't you get any research?	5	13
Because we never had to do it for them before.	5	13
The client didn't like it and we did.	5	13
In the end, isn't that how we know it's good?	5	13
- Then this is a success. - I consider it a success.	5	13
You didn't have to go a single day without telling me I'm an idiot.	5	13
I'll tell you what, I'm so bored of this dynamic.	5	13
I have your sister-in-law.	5	13
- Hello, Judy. - No, it's me.	5	13
Beth.	5	13
- I know who it is. - I have to see you.	5	13
Jesus, I'm at work.	5	13
Clara, could you go to the lobby and get me a pack of Life Savers?	5	13
What's wrong with the machine?	5	13
I want them fresh.	5	13
So you ran into me on the train and suddenly remember who I was?	5	13
Meet me where you wanted to meet before, the Hotel Pennsylvania.	5	13
I'll be there at noon under the name Mrs. Campbell.	5	13
I hope you like waiting. That's what I did.	5	13
This may be our last chance.	5	13
Why is this so hard?	5	13
"It has to be 125 words and 15 of them have to be ""Ajax."""	5	13
Fellas, can I have Miss Olson to myself for a minute?	5	13
Do you smoke?	5	13
Not really.	5	13
Well, get started.	5	13
Smoke it, name it, sell it.	5	13
What is it?	5	13
Philip Morris' top secret ladies' cigarette.	5	13
Leo Burnett thinks it's too small, and now it's in review.	5	13
So it's yourjob to make sure they're sorry.	5	13
- Great. - Evan!	5	13
Flip through the research at your leisure and then get your little ones on it.	5	13
Did they tell you anything I should know?	5	13
Does your boyfriend light your cigarettes?	5	13
- I don't smoke. - Yes, you do.	5	13
It's gotta make noise. Maybe she lights it herself.	5	13
So is that what it is, or is it something like that?	5	13
You're a woman and you smoke. What do you want?	5	13
All of last year's third and fourth quarters' work has posted	5	13
with sizeable checks from Vicks, Sugarberry and Heinz in the bank.	5	13
And with Mohawk returning to its prestrike billings,	5	13
revenues are up 34% from last year, making this our best quarter.	5	13
It's March. It's our only quarter.	5	13
Not this year. Ever.	5	13
And with Jaguar due to run	5	13
and Butler shooting and running within the month,	5	13
projections for next quarter are equally bright.	5	13
Have you found me an office?	5	13
Unfortunately, I was unable to go upstairs this morning.	5	13
Harry Crane.	5	13
But I am meeting with the building manager at lunch.	5	13
Get more than we need.	5	13
Any objections?	5	13
I'm sorry, but I feel someone has to voice the negatives.	5	13
Perhaps after one quarter, we should be careful not to overextend ourselves.	5	13
Can we just vote?	5	13
Or we could table this discussion until June.	5	13
- All in favor of tabling the vote? - Aye.	5	13
Tabling does not require a vote. It only needs to be seconded.	5	13
- What is this, parliament? - Is this meeting over yet?	5	13
No, it's not.	5	13
Don, I give you my proxy. I have things to do.	5	13
We can do that?	5	13
Thank God.	5	13
Stop it.	5	13
- I knew you'd show. - Because I'm pathetic?	5	13
If you're so angry, why did you come?	5	13
You know I had to.	5	13
Come sit with me.	5	13
I'm not going to my sister's.	5	13
I... Well, Howard checked me into the hospital this morning.	5	13
For what? What's wrong?	5	13
It's hard to explain, but I've been very blue	5	13
and the doctors seem to think the only thing to do is electroshock.	5	13
Shock treatment? You're not crazy.	5	13
Look, Peter, I wanted to see you because it's going to be different after.	5	13
It always is.	5	13
You've done it before?	5	13
Yes.	5	13
And it creates this sort of gray cloud.	5	13
The last time, I lost months and...	5	13
This is wonderful. You're wonderful.	5	13
I don't want to forget and I'm afraid I will.	5	13
I told them I was going to my niece's birthday party.	5	13
I have to be back by 5:00 so I'll be ready for tomorrow.	5	13
What makes you think I would do this? You are crazy.	5	13
Please.	5	13
Please give me this.	5	13
Oh, God.	5	13
Why does everybody want redheads?	5	13
Anybody can become a redhead. I mean, even Julia's working.	5	13
Working?	5	13
She did three days on Dark Shadows and then they fired her and cut her out.	5	13
Shit. I keep telling her how good she was.	5	13
This is why you're not working. You won't answer the phone.	5	13
Hello?	5	13
I can hear you.	5	13
Heavy breathing?	5	13
I thought it was a wrong number, but they keep calling	5	13
and they never say they're sorry.	5	13
I wish you would have told me we had company.	5	13
I wouldn't have come out like this.	5	13
Hello. Nice to meet you.	5	13
- Mother, this is Emily from class. - Pleasure.	5	13
Megan, did you get me an appointment for a wash and set?	5	13
Yes, Mama.	5	13
- How long are you in town for? - Only a week.	5	13
I wanted to spend Easter with my daughter. My husband is an atheist.	5	13
What are your plans for today?	5	13
- We are looking at the casting notices. - Bonne chance.	5	13
She's so elegant and encouraging.	5	13
I guess so.	5	13
Listen.	5	13
I hope you know that if I could ever help you in any way, I would want you to ask.	5	13
Okay.	5	13
My agent put me up for this part. It's really cute.	5	13
It's based on Beauty and the Beast	5	13
and, well, it's a commercial for Barnett shoes.	5	13
And?	5	13
Don's the Draper in Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, isn't he?	5	13
- Do you mean Butler shoes? - Yes, that's it.	5	13
Look, I really don't want to make you uncomfortable.	5	13
I am completely prepared for no. I just...	5	13
It' a European type.	5	13
I'm sorry, but Don doesn't do that. That's not the way it works.	5	13
It's really up to the client.	5	13
All I want is an audition.	5	13
I'd ask you who I have to sleep with, but I don't think you'd like it.	5	13
Okay. I'll see what I can do.	5	13
I am your eternal slave.	5	13
But if it doesn't work out,	5	13
you're gonna have to act like you never asked.	5	13
Now find me a job.	5	13
I should go.	5	13
Howard's coming by after work.	5	13
It was terrible.	5	13
I couldn't find the party, then I couldn't get a cab.	5	13
For four hours?	5	13
Don't tell me you're not happy right now. Don't tell me you don't feel better.	5	13
Howard can't make you do this.	5	13
He wants to control you. He's a monster.	5	13
You just hate him because he voted for Goldwater.	5	13
This is not a joke.	5	13
Let's go to Los Angeles. I've been there. It's filled with sunshine.	5	13
I can't.	5	13
Why?	5	13
It's so dark, Peter,	5	13
that I just	5	13
get to this place and I suddenly feel this door open	5	13
and I wanna walk through it.	5	13
That's for weak people,	5	13
people who can't solve a problem.	5	13
You want to solve a problem? Zip me up.	5	13
And then you'll leave.	5	13
- And what if you forget you love me? - Peter.	5	13
I don't know you and you don't know me.	5	13
We just happen to have the same problem.	5	13
I know, but we're only sad because we're apart.	5	13
Then I was wrong.	5	13
I really should go.	5	13
Why?	5	13
Because it works.	5	13
Really?	5	13
Five more minutes.	5	13
- Hello. - How are you feeling?	5	13
- Better. - Good.	5	13
Just in case, I made soup.	5	13
I'll change for dinner.	5	13
We'll be right out.	5	13
Are you really feeling better? I didn't get a kiss.	5	13
I swear I'm better.	5	13
Emily was telling me that Butler shoes is shooting a new commercial.	5	13
"""Beauty and the Beast."""	5	13
Well, she said they're looking for a European girl.	5	13
And I was thinking,	5	13
well, I'd be mad at myself if I didn't ask,	5	13
and, well, I wouldn't ask	5	13
if I didn't think I'd be right for it, but I really am.	5	13
What?	5	13
All I want you to do is put my name in a pile.	5	13
I know they're gonna wanna see what I look like on film	5	13
and I happen to have it.	5	13
You wanna be in a commercial?	5	13
I wanna work.	5	13
It's in town, so I'd be home for dinner.	5	13
- I thought you hated advertising. - I never said that.	5	13
Well, you certainly don't think it's art. And you're an artist, aren't you?	5	13
Are you mad at me?	5	13
I'm just surprised.	5	13
It's not theater, it's not Broadway, it's not film.	5	13
A national commercial? All my friends would kill for it.	5	13
- You'd get in the union, you'd get exposure. - You'd get money.	5	13
That's why they want it. You don't need that.	5	13
Do you know how hard this was for me to even ask you?	5	13
Do you know how hard it would be to ask Charles Butler Jr. to hire my wife?	5	13
I just want an audition. I'll be Megan Calvet.	5	13
Ken, Stan and Ginsberg are gonna be there. They know who you are.	5	13
- I'm gonna call the dentist. - No. I'm better.	5	13
Listen, just forget I brought any of this up.	5	13
It's just...	5	13
It's been so hard, you know.	5	13
I do. Look, you don't want it this way.	5	13
You wanna be somebody's discovery, not somebody's wife.	5	13
You're right. I know you're right.	5	13
- Aren't you gonna get it? - No. They've been hanging up all day.	5	13
Hello?	5	13
Who is this?	5	13
- Hello, is Marie there? - Emile?	5	13
Marie, s'il vous plait.	5	13
It's your father. I think he's drunk.	5	13
Hello?	5	13
Daddy's on the phone.	5	13
- AII?, Emile. - She's got it.	5	13
Marie, it's Roger.	5	13
Marie, it's Roger Sterling. I've used up all the French I know.	5	13
What is Regina?	5	13
Thank you.	5	13
Megan, you know I would if I could.	5	13
Of course.	5	13
I'm gonna take a bath before dinner.	5	13
How did you know I was here?	5	13
Because Don was complaining you were drinking all his liquor.	5	13
So you wanted to see me?	5	13
You could have arranged a dinner for the four of us.	5	13
Really? You'd do that?	5	13
No, because I'm not that kind of woman.	5	13
No, no, of course you're not.	5	13
It's just, well, I enjoy your company	5	13
and I thought if you were willing to broach impropriety ever so slightly,	5	13
I could have dinner brought to my apartment.	5	13
The kid from room service can chaperone.	5	13
Room service? Is it a hotel?	5	13
The Stanhope. And you can just ask for me in the lobby.	5	13
It's very discreet.	5	13
They just send the girls right up?	5	13
Look, I called you.	5	13
In fact, I had hung up on your daughter about a dozen times today.	5	13
I'm not asking for anything more than a little conversation, I swear.	5	13
I'll try to get away	5	13
on the condition that you lower your expectations.	5	13
Below conversation?	5	13
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	5	13
How are you feeling?	5	13
- Could you get me some ice? - Right away.	5	13
Mrs. Harris wants to see you. She's been waiting in there quite a while.	5	13
Morning.	5	13
What can I do for you?	5	13
I want to reopen the conversation about more space.	5	13
You're not gonna put anybody in here, are you?	5	13
No.	5	13
It's just I've been trying so hard to be so responsible and careful	5	13
and I don't even know why,	5	13
because every day I open the mail and there's more money.	5	13
That's the idea, isn't it?	5	13
I got this this morning.	5	13
The death benefit from the company insurance policy.	5	13
It's $175,000.	5	13
So what's your question?	5	13
Why would he do that?	5	13
You'll never get an answer. You can't think about that.	5	13
But I do. And then I can't stop it. What could I have done?	5	13
Nothing.	5	13
It's not true.	5	13
Why didn't I give him what he wanted?	5	13
What did he want?	5	13
And now there's this, this profit.	5	13
How much did he put in for collateral after Lucky Strike left?	5	13
$50,000.	5	13
We should pay that back.	5	13
- Shouldn't we have a vote? - No.	5	13
Cut a check to his wife.	5	13
Are you under the weather?	5	13
I have a hot tooth.	5	13
I know a dentist. He's in the steeple of the Chrysler Building.	5	13
Even if he can't help you, you still get to see the view.	5	13
It'll go away.	5	13
I have your ice.	5	13
I'll take that.	5	13
Put that on your face, not in a drink.	5	13
I don't feel well. Just go to The Cloisters without me.	5	13
No, Mother.	5	13
I'm sad.	5	13
I know.	5	13
What do I do?	5	13
Why are you always so nice to strangers? You don't ever care what I wanna do.	5	13
You're supposed to be encouraging.	5	13
Not every little girl gets to do what they want.	5	13
The world could not support that many ballerinas.	5	13
Is that what you tell yourself?	5	13
I'm sorry to drop by like this.	5	13
If I sound distracted, it's only because I'm waiting for a bed to be delivered.	5	13
My mother is coming to stay.	5	13
That should be helpful.	5	13
- May I? - Of course.	5	13
I'd offer you something, but I have nothing in the house.	5	13
First, let me offer my apologies.	5	13
But with the funeral abroad	5	13
and you declining our offer to have a memorial,	5	13
I really haven't been sure how to express our condolences.	5	13
It may be the difference in our cultures, but we're not ones to wallow.	5	13
Well, I'm not sure if you're aware,	5	13
but last year the partners were required to put up collateral.	5	13
And although the firm has six years to repay,	5	13
it was unanimous that we try and help you through this difficult time.	5	13
Again, I'm very sorry for your loss.	5	13
Yes, I hope you feel better.	5	13
I think it'll make a difference.	5	13
How much is it?	5	13
$50,000.	5	13
You had no right to fill a man like that with ambition.	5	13
I found this in his wallet.	5	13
Who is this?	5	13
- I don't know. - Don't just consider the office.	5	13
Think of all the brothels you frequent.	5	13
- I should go. - Yes, perhaps you should.	5	13
I'm truly sorry for your loss.	5	13
It's probably difficult for you to believe,	5	13
but it was even more than $50,000 that already belonged to him,	5	13
so don't leave here thinking	5	13
that you've done anything for anyone but yourself.	5	13
Hello.	5	13
Say hi to Daddy.	5	13
The table's set in there. I wanted to leave these out for you.	5	13
What is this?	5	13
They're the plans for the pool.	5	13
They can start in May right after the rain.	5	13
That's you.	5	13
- I don't know, Trudy. It's awfully permanent. - I know.	5	13
It'll add tremendous value to the property.	5	13
And Lord knows you're so much better when you get some sun.	5	13
Tammy could drown.	5	13
What is wrong with you?	5	13
I'm sorry.	5	13
This doom and gloom, I'm tired of it.	5	13
Not one thing you said was true.	5	13
No dinner, no chaperone, no conversation.	5	13
Stop being demure. You're already on the bed.	5	13
I hoped that you would call.	5	13
And I hoped that you would come.	5	13
And not just for obvious reasons.	5	13
I don't believe you.	5	13
You know, one of my partners, he ended it all.	5	13
You'd have to be so sure you were going someplace better, wouldn't you?	5	13
But I think maybe that place is here.	5	13
Why are you saying this?	5	13
Would you take LSD with me?	5	13
What?	5	13
I love that you're so calm, but you're adventurous.	5	13
And honestly, I need to take it again to really appreciate here	5	13
and I don't wanna do it alone.	5	13
And I think if you were there, then it'd be okay.	5	13
Roger, please don't ask me for anything.	5	13
Please don't ask me to take care of you.	5	13
Is there anything else I can do?	5	13
There you are, right where you are.	5	13
I missed you.	5	13
Jesus. Come on.	5	13
Let's get you to bed.	5	13
- Where's your mother? - She abandoned me.	5	13
You can't even kiss me?	5	13
Just go to the dentist, because I need you right now.	5	13
- Megan. - Please.	5	13
It's the only thing I'm good for.	5	13
What the hell happened today?	5	13
This is what you want, isn't it? For me to be waiting for you.	5	13
That's why you won't give me a chance.	5	13
That's not true.	5	13
I know, I know.	5	13
Because it's either that or I'm terrible.	5	13
But how the hell would you know?	5	13
You're really drunk.	5	13
Sleep it off.	5	13
Where were you?	5	13
I have friends in New York.	5	13
How could you leave her like that, drunk out of her mind?	5	13
She's married to you. That's yourjob.	5	13
She left my house a happy girl.	5	13
And you show up and she's miserable.	5	13
I know it's hard to watch,	5	13
but this is what happens when you have the artistic temperament	5	13
but you are not an artist.	5	13
Take my advice,	5	13
nurse her through this defeat and you shall have the life you desire.	5	13
I have postcards to write.	5	13
You almost had a nasty abscess.	5	13
You should have had it extracted days ago.	5	13
I kept thinking it would go away.	5	13
Yeah? You're lucky you didn't lose yourjaw.	5	13
Just breathe through your nose.	5	13
You're in bad shape, Dick.	5	13
What are you doing here?	5	13
I lost my job when I died.	5	13
I'm gonna do you a favor and take it out.	5	13
But it's not your tooth that's rotten.	5	13
Don't go.	5	13
Don't leave me.	5	13
Don't worry.	5	13
I'll hang around.	5	13
Get it?	5	13
You're gonna be sore,	5	13
so just take it easy for the rest of the day.	5	13
Fill that prescription I gave you and don't smoke for 24 hours.	5	13
Mrs. Dawes?	5	13
Beth, your brother's here to see you.	5	13
Yes, of course. Come in.	5	13
You know, you're right.	5	13
You really do have the same eyes.	5	13
I'm so glad you came.	5	13
How are you feeling?	5	13
I don't have a brother.	5	13
It was the only way I could get in.	5	13
But what are you doing here?	5	13
Well, I was worried about you.	5	13
That's right.	5	13
I'm sorry.	5	13
I'm in the wrong room.	5	13
But you can still visit.	5	13
But I'm here to visit my friend.	5	13
Please.	5	13
Please, keep me company.	5	13
What's wrong with your friend?	5	13
He...	5	13
He got involved	5	13
with another man's wife.	5	13
And that put him in the hospital?	5	13
From the complications.	5	13
Why did he do it?	5	13
Well, all the regular reasons, I guess.	5	13
He needed to let off some steam,	5	13
he needed adventure, he needed to feel handsome again.	5	13
He needed to feel that he knew something,	5	13
that all this aging was worth something	5	13
because he knew things young people didn't know yet.	5	13
He probably thought it would be like having a few tall drinks	5	13
and feeling very, very good.	5	13
And then he'd go back to his life and say,	5	13
"""That was nice."""	5	13
But then he got sick?	5	13
When it went away,	5	13
he was heartbroken.	5	13
And then he realized everything he already had was not right either	5	13
and that was why it had happened at all.	5	13
And that his life with his family was some	5	13
temporary bandage on a permanent wound.	5	13
Don't worry.	5	13
They'll fix him up here.	5	13
They're very good.	5	13
He'll be fine.	5	13
Well, it was nice to meet you.	5	13
Good luck with your friend.	5	13
Oh, my goodness.	5	13
How are you?	5	13
- Are you waiting for somebody? - Nope.	5	13
What are you doing here?	5	13
- Did you lose yourjob? - No.	5	13
Did you?	5	13
You look good.	5	13
How's Megan?	5	13
She's good.	5	13
You're kind of new at that job to be avoiding the office.	5	13
Just knocking out the cobwebs.	5	13
Someone told me this works.	5	13
So it's going well?	5	13
Yeah.	5	13
Is that okay?	5	13
That's what happens when you help someone,	5	13
they succeed and move on.	5	13
Don't you want them to?	5	13
I'm proud of you.	5	13
I just didn't know it would be without me.	5	13
Well, put me on your call list.	5	13
What are you working on?	5	13
We're trying to get that women's cigarette you were after.	5	13
God, I miss that easy money.	5	13
It's easy to have. It's not easy to win.	5	13
You'll beat it.	5	13
Well, I'm going to Virginia to tour the factory.	5	13
I'm going on a plane.	5	13
- Richmond's nice. - It's not Paris.	5	13
And I'm going with Frank Gleason.	5	13
- Will you give my love to Megan? - Sure.	5	13
We should all get together.	5	13
Yes.	5	13
Howdy, partner!	5	13
What do you say we get off in Harrison,	5	13
get back on the train and go get into some trouble?	5	13
- What? - I'm on my own.	5	13
You can say you fell asleep. You did.	5	13
You are the most disgusting person I have ever seen.	5	13
Come on!	5	13
How could you do that to that woman?	5	13
You just couldn't wait to get her in the hospital and erase her brain.	5	13
It's you?	5	13
She always spreads her legs for the first chump she can find.	5	13
What you doing?	5	13
Break it up!	5	13
- Knock it off! - Gentlemen, calm down!	5	13
You okay, buddy?	5	13
You, Max Schmeling, you go that way.	5	13
- He started it. - Out!	5	13
- My things are in the bar. - That's not a surprise.	5	13
You're a real prick, you know that?	5	13
Listen, buddy, you're gonna give it a couple of minutes,	5	13
you're gonna go down there and apologize.	5	13
To him?	5	13
Never.	5	13
You gotta ride the train every day and he's a fellow commuter.	5	13
And I don't like fighting on my train.	5	13
It's your train.	5	13
Are you paying to ride on it? We're paying you to ride on it.	5	13
You work for us, so why don't you go down there and apologize to him?	5	13
- I'm about to throw you off. - Go ahead, you fat piece of crap.	5	13
I am an officer of the New Haven line.	5	13
Well, I'm president of the Howdy Doody circus army.	5	13
- That's it, come on. You're coming... - Get your hands off me!	5	13
You can't do that!	5	13
Get off the train. Harrison!	5	13
Next stop, Harrison.	5	13
What on earth happened? Were you in another car accident?	5	13
The car's fine. There's not a scratch on it.	5	13
I'm not worried about the car.	5	13
My goodness, look at you.	5	13
I fell asleep and ran into a ditch.	5	13
Come with me.	5	13
I can't live like this.	5	13
Knowing you're out there working so hard	5	13
and then wondering if you're going to come home and in what condition.	5	13
I'll come home.	5	13
I think you were right.	5	13
And first thing tomorrow morning,	5	13
we're going to find you an apartment in the city.	5	13
I think this is where the staircase goes.	5	13
I'm going to have the same view as you, Don.	5	13
Congratulations.	5	13
There she is. There's our Beauty.	5	13
Nice to see you again.	5	13
You look perfect.	5	13
- When do we start? - When they're ready.	5	13
I can't believe this is happening.	5	13
Miss Calvet, would you step in, please?	5	13
You know I love you.	5	13
Rehearsal in five.	5	13
Give me an Old Fashioned.	5	13
Excuse me, do you have a light?	5	13
Thank you.	5	13
I'm sorry, but my friend down there,	5	13
she was wondering.	5	13
Are you alone?	5	13
Previously on Mad Men...	6	1
When we land Jaguar, the world will know.	6	1
Herb Rennet has demanded to spend a night with Joan.	6	1
This is some very dirty business.	6	1
I wanted to tell you it's not worth it.	6	1
Tell them I want a partnership. Not silent.	6	1
I want all the partners here.	6	1
First thing tomorrow morning we're going to find you an apartment in the city.	6	1
- I need you right now. - Megan...	6	1
It's the only thing I'm good for.	6	1
I think she just... needed her mother.	6	1
 I'm tired of trying to prove I still have a value around here.	6	1
It's what happens when you help someone...	6	1
they succeed and move on.	6	1
Don't you want them to?	6	1
Miss Calvet, could you step in, please?	6	1
You know I love you.	6	1
Are you alone?	6	1
That's it.	6	1
- That's it, hang in there. - Oh, my God!	6	1
Oh, my God.	6	1
"""Midway in our life's journey,"	6	1
I went astray from the straight road	6	1
and woke to find myself alone	6	1
"in a dark wood."""	6	1
 Mmm.	6	1
Mahalo.	6	1
It's still suite 282.	6	1
How long has it been?	6	1
Can't get too suntanned, they'll fire me.	6	1
Oh, you must have gotten it wet.	6	1
Let me see.	6	1
You know what? Who cares what time it is?	6	1
You would not have liked that.	6	1
You wouldn't have liked it at all.	6	1
I had to walk down the beach away from the crowds	6	1
to this surf shop and knock on a door with a closed sign.	6	1
It was so seedy down there.	6	1
Plus, I had to get my money from here.	6	1
Come on.	6	1
I know you've tried it, but you haven't had sex high.	6	1
It makes it so much more intense.	6	1
Everything you see on your plate is what you would find	6	1
in a royal Hawaiian feast.	6	1
That purple pudding is poi.	6	1
It's strange, but satisfying.	6	1
And we Hawaiians say that it's ono,	6	1
which means tasty.	6	1
"But you might just say, ""Ono, I'm not eating that."""	6	1
This is real Hawaiian food.	6	1
Even the macaroni salad.	6	1
But, of course, at the Royal Hawaiian,	6	1
we try to treat every guest like they're--	6	1
Well, everything is better here.	6	1
I'm sure it is.	6	1
It must take a lot of work to stand out in paradise.	6	1
Don, you have to try this.	6	1
Oh, don't bother. It's wallpaper paste.	6	1
Just eat the pig.	6	1
Now, while you stay with us at the lovely,	6	1
beautiful Royal Hawaiian,	6	1
make sure you see enchanted Diamond Head	6	1
and all of the natural wonders of the island	6	1
by bus or by boat.	6	1
It's easy if you book	6	1
one of our guided tours in the lobby.	6	1
Aloha.	6	1
Come. Come dance.	6	1
I've got nothing to do with this.	6	1
Go ahead, Don.	6	1
Leave him alone, honey.	6	1
I want to do it.	6	1
No, you have to do it like this.	6	1
You have to relax.	6	1
Get in the spirit of the islands.	6	1
They call me the Hawaiian Elvis.	6	1
Gentlemen, I remind you,	6	1
this is my job.	6	1
Stop laughing or I'll make them come back for you.	6	1
Excuse me, Corinne. I hate to bother you.	6	1
I mean, I know your name's not Corinne.	6	1
No, It's Megan Calvet.	6	1
- Oh, my goodness. I'm really bothering you. - No, not at all.	6	1
You're so much trimmer than you are on TV. Do people tell you that?	6	1
"- I-- no. - ""To Have and to Hold"" is my favorite."	6	1
I mean, I watch a few, and you're obviously on vacation.	6	1
"- It's okay. - Well, I know you're new to ""Berkshire Falls,"""	6	1
but I can tell you-- you just have a way.	6	1
Thank you so much.	6	1
Would you mind signing an autograph to my niece?	6	1
She's a bigger fan than I am.	6	1
I'd be delighted.	6	1
- What's her name? - Karen.	6	1
It's like Corinne.	6	1
I can't believe Victor won't acknowledge you.	6	1
Well, we'll see what happens.	6	1
Enjoy your stay.	6	1
Those women really knew me.	6	1
One of them was from Minnesota.	6	1
I didn't even know they had the show there.	6	1
I love it here.	6	1
Hey, Galloway, you want another?	6	1
Can I get a tall beer? Chop chop.	6	1
So, mister, has he moved at all?	6	1
Well, you're either dead or you've got great balance.	6	1
Hey, were you in the service?	6	1
I got the same one.	6	1
- What branch? - Army.	6	1
You can say that again.	6	1
- Korea? - Briefly.	6	1
Was Korea like this?	6	1
'Cause I'll tell you, they offer you R&R in Honolulu	6	1
"and you think, ""Did anybody notice it's the same place?"""	6	1
But I'm glad to be here, I can tell you that.	6	1
You on your anniversary?	6	1
Folks have been pretty friendly.	6	1
After all the shit that went on last summer Stateside,	6	1
I was looking for a fight.	6	1
That'd be classy-- showing up with a black eye.	6	1
This is my bachelor party.	6	1
I'm getting married tomorrow.	6	1
Congratulations. Let me buy you a drink.	6	1
Nah, I got a shitload of combat pay.	6	1
Let me buy you one.	6	1
You some kind of astronaut?	6	1
I'm in advertising.	6	1
We got this .50 caliber machine gun.	6	1
The M2.	6	1
You should see what it does to a water buffalo.	6	1
Oh, my Lord. I could paint this place red.	6	1
How long do you have left?	6	1
Ceremony's at 0800.	6	1
Four hours or so.	6	1
No, in Vietnam.	6	1
Eight months.	6	1
Someone told her married guys live longer	6	1
'cause they got something to live for.	6	1
She's from San Diego.	6	1
She's Mexican.	6	1
She met me halfway in Hawaii.	6	1
I met her halfway by getting married.	6	1
Were you married when you were in Korea?	6	1
No.	6	1
And you made it.	6	1
Listen, Lieutenant.	6	1
What do you say we get into some trouble?	6	1
It's PFC Dinkins, by the way.	6	1
It's usually printed right there.	6	1
Don.	6	1
So how do you feel about giving away the bride?	6	1
You don't think your friend's gonna make it?	6	1
Nah, he's my best man.	6	1
Her family's in San Ysidro.	6	1
And I don't want some hotel employee being her dad.	6	1
They look just like the enemy.	6	1
Am I wrong?	6	1
There's plenty of GIs here. There's no one else you know?	6	1
Who gave your bride away?	6	1
I'd love to help you out, but you don't even know me.	6	1
I think you'd regret it later.	6	1
I believe in what goes around comes around.	6	1
One day I'm gonna be a veteran in paradise.	6	1
One day I'll be the man who can't sleep	6	1
and talks to strangers.	6	1
I, James, take you, Connie, for my lawful wife,	6	1
to have and to hold from this day forward.	6	1
For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer,	6	1
in sickness and in health,	6	1
until death do us part.	6	1
What were you doing wrong?	6	1
I'm so sorry, Officer. It's very hard to see.	6	1
That's why you have to drive slower.	6	1
We go easy on the speed limit here, but not with this ice.	6	1
I promise I will do that in the future.	6	1
I'm afraid this is about what you already did.	6	1
You may not be aware, but this is Betty Francis.	6	1
You may know her husband, my son, Henry Francis.	6	1
He works in the mayor's office in Manhattan. Mayor Lindsay.	6	1
I work for New York State. We've got our own mayor.	6	1
I'll do without your sarcasm, young man.	6	1
Now, if you don't mind,	6	1
I think all concerned will be very content	6	1
if you issue a stern warning and let us be on our way.	6	1
Pauline.	6	1
I'm trying to avoid taking you off the road with a shovel.	6	1
She's driving like a maniac.	6	1
Yell at her.	6	1
I hate cops.	6	1
Nonsense. They're just doing their job.	6	1
Well, they're too enthusiastic.	6	1
That ruined it. That ruined everything.	6	1
I can't imagine it getting any darker than this.	6	1
My mom's dead.	6	1
"How was ""The Nutcracker""?"	6	1
- The highlight of the evening. - Magical as always.	6	1
Well, Bobby, Gene, and I are sorry we missed it.	6	1
Nothing like the ballet, right, boys?	6	1
Is Sandy sleeping over?	6	1
What do you care?	6	1
Isn't somebody going to say something?	6	1
Betty got a ticket.	6	1
For what?	6	1
I thought it was going to be speeding,	6	1
but apparently it's reckless driving.	6	1
I want you to tell your wife	6	1
that invoking your name in an interaction with a state trooper	6	1
is nothing to be ashamed of.	6	1
Ma, it barely works for me.	6	1
Then Grandma Pauline yelled at him.	6	1
- I did nothing of the sort. - What did he do?	6	1
- He was verbally abusive. - Give him the ticket.	6	1
He'll fix it. He does it for everyone.	6	1
Ma, you know how I fix those tickets?	6	1
I pay 'em.	6	1
- Can I open it? - Mm-hmm.	6	1
Get away, you little weirdo.	6	1
I like the case. It looks like a coffin.	6	1
Would you play a little? That'd be nice.	6	1
I don't know.	6	1
Please. It makes me feel so much.	6	1
This is disgusting. Don't let them force you.	6	1
Have you been playing long?	6	1
- She's going to Juilliard next semester. - Juilliard?	6	1
Why didn't you tell me we were in the presence of a prodigy?	6	1
15 is not a prodigy.	6	1
Sorry about that. Checking the steam.	6	1
- How was your trip? - Wonderful.	6	1
Warm. I did not miss this.	6	1
How are you feeling?	6	1
Let me in there.	6	1
It's okay, Jonesy.	6	1
- Jesus, what's his real name? - I don't know.	6	1
Open his coat. Open his coat.	6	1
Sylvia, call an ambulance.	6	1
There's a phone at the desk.	6	1
Okay, Jonesy, keep listening to me.	6	1
Come on, I know you can hear me.	6	1
Come on.	6	1
Let me get those.	6	1
- Absolutely not. - I'm surprised you're back at work.	6	1
Oh, the missus couldn't wait to get me out of the house.	6	1
- I don't believe it. - Oh, wait.	6	1
Messenger came with your script yesterday.	6	1
I didn't let it out of my sight.	6	1
I got you a pretty nice bottle for Christmas	6	1
in case you can't read the handwriting.	6	1
Well, I hope you got Dr. Rosen a case.	6	1
I thought you were going to stop reading that before bed.	6	1
It's not bothering me tonight.	6	1
I bet it isn't.	6	1
You're so calm from all that violin.	6	1
She plays beautifully.	6	1
You and Bobby had the same look on your face when she was playing.	6	1
She's a year older than Sally. Shame on you.	6	1
No one would blame me for leaving you for a teenage musician.	6	1
She's just in the next room.	6	1
Why don't you go in there and rape her?	6	1
- I'll hold her arms down. - Betty, what the hell?	6	1
You said you wanted to spice things up.	6	1
Will it ruin it if I'm there?	6	1
You know what? If you want to be alone with her,	6	1
I'll put on my housecoat and take Sally for a ride.	6	1
You can stick a rag in her mouth and you won't wake the boys.	6	1
All right. All right, Betty.	6	1
My goodness. You're blushing.	6	1
She left the sliding door open.	6	1
There's dirt all over the rug.	6	1
Maybe she wanted to air out the place.	6	1
I'm gonna take the cleaning out of her Christmas present.	6	1
One scene.	6	1
I take somebody's coat and offer them a drink.	6	1
You're the maid. It's more than ours does.	6	1
One scene, Don. They send me to pack suitcases.	6	1
Yours or theirs?	6	1
Victor's.	6	1
Then I'd be worried if I was Victor.	6	1
I shouldn't have gone on vacation.	6	1
What are you doing up?	6	1
I couldn't sleep. I didn't want to wake Sally,	6	1
although you have the creakiest floor.	6	1
It's an old house. At least turn on a light.	6	1
Are you hungry?	6	1
Are you gonna have something?	6	1
Yes,	6	1
but I really have to be careful this time of year.	6	1
Why?	6	1
I'm trying to reduce.	6	1
Why don't you just be the way you are? You're beautiful.	6	1
That's charming and you know it.	6	1
My mother wore a girdle all the time	6	1
and she always had a stomachache and I always thought,	6	1
"""You'd rather have a stomachache just so Dad will like you?"""	6	1
Sandy,	6	1
my mother passed away a few years ago	6	1
and I understand.	6	1
This time of year is the hardest.	6	1
Oh, dear.	6	1
We're happy to include you in our family.	6	1
I can't go to Juilliard.	6	1
I know how you're feeling.	6	1
I was older than you, but I remember	6	1
when I went to Bryn Mawr, I was terrified.	6	1
- But then the minute I-- - No.	6	1
I didn't get in.	6	1
They rejected me.	6	1
Oh.	6	1
Of course you'd lie about that.	6	1
So you'll try again next year.	6	1
Tell everyone you wanted to finish high school.	6	1
It's incredible how fast some people come up with lies.	6	1
Please don't do that.	6	1
I'm old for a violinist.	6	1
At least for one as good as I am.	6	1
I don't care. All I wanted to do was go to New York.	6	1
In a few years.	6	1
But it'll be too late.	6	1
My feet are already in wet cement.	6	1
Plenty of girls do just fine without Juilliard.	6	1
Sure, you go to college,	6	1
you meet a boy, you drop out,	6	1
you get married,	6	1
struggle for a year in New York while he learns to tie a tie,	6	1
and then move to the country and just start the whole disaster over.	6	1
That's an arrogant exaggeration.	6	1
You have so much.	6	1
I didn't ask for it and I don't need it.	6	1
You don't need it?	6	1
Do you know what it's like to have nothing?	6	1
- Do you? - Why do you keep insulting me?	6	1
I'm trying to help.	6	1
No, aren't you curious?	6	1
There are people in the Village.	6	1
I read about it and I even visited them.	6	1
You went to the city alone? Did Sally go with you?	6	1
No.	6	1
But she told me you went.	6	1
That you were a model.	6	1
Yes.	6	1
And I lived with five girls in two rooms	6	1
and ate soup out of cans.	6	1
It's not glamorous.	6	1
But I bet it was great.	6	1
It was different back then.	6	1
There weren't all the riots and robberies.	6	1
Do you watch the news?	6	1
I visited this building	6	1
right off St. Mark's Place.	6	1
And the kids are just living and it's beautiful.	6	1
You know?	6	1
People are naturally democratic if you give them a chance.	6	1
Are you on dope?	6	1
No.	6	1
- But-- - But...	6	1
you're going to wait until you're old enough to live on your own.	6	1
It's two years.	6	1
Hardly a jail sentence.	6	1
You know, you're not my child,	6	1
so there's no reason for me to say this,	6	1
but I go to the symphony quite a bit,	6	1
whether I like it or not,	6	1
and I am certain that you are talented.	6	1
And on the bright side,	6	1
Sally was crushed you were going away.	6	1
Want to use the bathroom?	6	1
- I think I'm feeling better. - I'm not.	6	1
- There's Pepto-Bismol. - I think it's too late.	6	1
I don't like vegetarian food.	6	1
Reminds me of Lent.	6	1
Exactly. It's a punishment.	6	1
- Hello? - Peggy Olson, please.	6	1
This is Peggy. Who is this?	6	1
- Did you watch Carson? - Who is this?	6	1
It's Burt. Burt Peterson.	6	1
Oh. Is everything okay?	6	1
I'm calling you at midnight. We're screwed, Peggy.	6	1
We're at DEFCON 3. We're about to go to DEFCON 4.	6	1
DEFCON 4 is better than DEFCON 3.	6	1
I've told you that. One is the worst.	6	1
- Then we're at zero. - There is no zero.	6	1
Some comic on Carson was breaking everybody up with this routine about the war.	6	1
Burt, it's very late and you sound a little under the weather	6	1
and there's such a thing as free speech in this country.	6	1
I could give a hoot. Koss Headphones wants to pull our Super Bowl spot.	6	1
He hates the line now.	6	1
"""Lend me your ears""? It's Shakespeare."	6	1
Well, it's somehow related to something.	6	1
The president. I don't know. I didn't see it.	6	1
You there?	6	1
Yes.	6	1
So you got to change your ad.	6	1
- Now it's my ad? - He wants to meet for a discussion.	6	1
- About what? - I don't know. Something bad.	6	1
I take the client's word for it.	6	1
- You've got to call Ted. - About what?	6	1
I don't even know what the problem is.	6	1
It's better coming from you. I've got to go.	6	1
What time is it in Colorado?	6	1
I don't know. I can't do any math right now.	6	1
I can't do any math at all.	6	1
Please, honey, don't talk.	6	1
Morning.	6	1
I guess I don't say Merry Christmas to you.	6	1
Save that for Sylvia. How was Hawaii?	6	1
Long ago and far away.	6	1
What's that camera you guys are selling?	6	1
- Pentax? - Leica.	6	1
And which model will change my life?	6	1
Like everybody else, I only know them by the price.	6	1
You know what?	6	1
Come by.	6	1
I got a closetful. I'll give you one.	6	1
Come on. I'll pay for it.	6	1
I'd give one to Christiaan Barnard.	6	1
I might just come by.	6	1
You owe me just for that comment alone.	6	1
- You can come by right now. - No.	6	1
I'm gonna be in surgery till 2:00. Maybe after.	6	1
Remember, you come by my office, I get to go to yours.	6	1
Another glorious morning, Dr. Rosen.	6	1
No good deed...	6	1
I don't know.	6	1
Probably part of a deeper question.	6	1
Because, I mean, none of them are really blonde anyway, right?	6	1
She's 29 years old.	6	1
Hair darkens by that age, so she's probably a brunette.	6	1
Maybe she does remind me of Jane.	6	1
No, I think it's more than just distraction.	6	1
I think you're being hard on me.	6	1
"You used the word ""distraction."""	6	1
Did I? Well, I need a vacation.	6	1
I'm busy. I'm a busy man.	6	1
"I walk around that place, people say ""Good morning"" to me."	6	1
They don't really care. They don't know anything about me.	6	1
Oh, God, Doc, what is it all about?	6	1
Help me.	6	1
I say-- I say that's a joke, son.	6	1
- We discussed this. - What?	6	1
I can't laugh at everything you say.	6	1
Either it's funny or it's not.	6	1
I don't know how you can control yourself.	6	1
It's hard sometimes. We talked about that, too.	6	1
What exactly are you joking about?	6	1
You're obviously not afraid that you're boring.	6	1
What are the events in life?	6	1
It's like you see a door.	6	1
The first time you come to it you say,	6	1
"""Oh, what's on the other side of the door?"""	6	1
Then you open a few doors.	6	1
"Then you say, ""I think I want to go over that bridge this time."	6	1
"I'm tired of doors."" Finally you go through one of these things"	6	1
and you come out the other side and you realize that's all there are--	6	1
doors and windows and bridges and gates.	6	1
And they all open the same way	6	1
and they all close behind you.	6	1
Look, life is supposed to be a path and you go along	6	1
and these things happen to you and they're supposed to change you.	6	1
Change your direction. But it turns out that's not true.	6	1
It turns out the experiences are nothing.	6	1
They're just some pennies you pick up off the floor,	6	1
stick in your pocket, and you're just going in a straight line	6	1
to you-know-where.	6	1
You sound afraid.	6	1
More like irritated.	6	1
And what do you think is causing that?	6	1
Top of the list, New Year's.	6	1
It's like an extra birthday.	6	1
You're supposed to blow out the candle and wish for something.	6	1
I don't even know what it is.	6	1
How was your Christmas?	6	1
Same as the last five-- ruined by work.	6	1
- How was yours? - I'm a widower, Peggy.	6	1
Oh. I'm sorry.	6	1
"Apparently there was a bunch of jokes on the ""Tonight Show,"""	6	1
in question, about soldiers cutting off ears in Vietnam.	6	1
And obviously we are gonna have to go in another direction.	6	1
_	6	1
What did they say?	6	1
Well, I wasn't able	6	1
to obtain a copy or a transcript,	6	1
but Lawrence here is a devout viewer.	6	1
I don't know if I can do it justice.	6	1
Just shut up and do it.	6	1
Well, he came out and started talking about	6	1
how that surgeon in South Africa	6	1
transplanted a heart. And he says,	6	1
"""Now I know what I'm getting President Johnson for Christmas."""	6	1
- Who is this guy? - I'm Lawrence.	6	1
- No, the comedian. - We're finding that out.	6	1
- You have no information. - We know the host was Phyllis Diller.	6	1
Get to the ears.	6	1
Well, I don't remember how he got to it,	6	1
but it was something about how	6	1
the first transplants they did were with dogs.	6	1
So obviously there could be some sort of mix-up or something.	6	1
Dad's better, but he goes nuts every time we run the can opener.	6	1
He hates the mailman or something.	6	1
And, oh, he keeps ruining the carpet.	6	1
Only thing that stops him is hitting him on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.	6	1
Do you remember the ear joke or not?	6	1
Well, he went back to Christmas.	6	1
Did you hear about how there are these GIs	6	1
with interesting decorations?	6	1
'Cause they cut off the Vietcong's ears	6	1
and wore them on a string around their neck like a trophy.	6	1
Oh. They really did that?	6	1
There's a court-martial.	6	1
"Did he actually say ""Vietcong"" on Carson?"	6	1
I don't remember. This is the best I can do.	6	1
- I think you're very good. - You think so?	6	1
So, was that it?	6	1
No. The big laugh was	6	1
a general comes up to one of these guys	6	1
"and says, ""That's not regulation, son."""	6	1
"The soldier says, ""Pardon? Could you speak into my necklace?"""	6	1
Biggest laugh even though the transplant jokes were better.	6	1
That's not even funny. What did Phyllis do?	6	1
She just said something like,	6	1
"""I told you he was a sick puppy."""	6	1
When is Koss coming in?	6	1
1:00. Should I order lunch?	6	1
He loves the Russian Tea Room.	6	1
No, this is an emergency meeting.	6	1
I should probably practice a little more.	6	1
The client's already seen it.	6	1
Go home. There's no second show.	6	1
- What did Ted say? - I left a message.	6	1
I don't think there's anything to do	6	1
but work our way through 100 versions of no.	6	1
Listen, don't get in your own way.	6	1
No, I've seen creatives do this.	6	1
I've seen Ted do it. This is the Super Bowl.	6	1
It's a lot of money. A lot of exposure for the agency.	6	1
- There's probably awards down the road. - I know.	6	1
Believe me, I know.	6	1
"The fucking ""Tonight Show."""	6	1
Now, Peggy, I think it's the Army	6	1
that's really at fault here.	6	1
You look tan. Did you have fun?	6	1
I'm sorry, but your name escapes me.	6	1
I'm Bob Benson. I'm upstairs in Accounts.	6	1
Beloit College, Wharton MBA.	6	1
Secor, Mohawk, Life Cereal.	6	1
You know, but just in the outfield.	6	1
Yes, of course.	6	1
We spoke at the Christmas party.	6	1
You seemed to know your way around Pennsylvania.	6	1
You want one of these? I get it right next door.	6	1
People will take a few extra steps for a superior product.	6	1
Doesn't it belong to someone else?	6	1
No, I always get two. I don't want to share.	6	1
You know, I have through,	6	1
let's just say low-level corruption,	6	1
obtained tickets to the Cotton Bowl.	6	1
Crimson Tide versus Texas A&M.	6	1
You play football?	6	1
- What's in that coffee? - Excuse me?	6	1
Oh.	6	1
Look, I've been trying to get to know your team.	6	1
Not that I'm so important. And they talk about you all the time.	6	1
So I guess I figured a few minutes alone with you shouldn't be wasted.	6	1
Just a minute, Bob.	6	1
I smell creativity.	6	1
I love it down here.	6	1
I can't believe you just came off of 10 hours of plane travel.	6	1
- You look great. - No, Stan, you look great.	6	1
Changing the subject ever so slightly,	6	1
during your travels did you notice if the stewardesses	6	1
would let a mother hold a baby on her lap the whole ride?	6	1
I believe so.	6	1
- Ha! - Really?	6	1
Don't feel bad. I mean, how would you know? You never had any kids.	6	1
Last time you left town, it was in a covered wagon.	6	1
Because you're old.	6	1
You're so tan.	6	1
- So how was the vacation? - He was on assignment.	6	1
On Waikiki Beach. How much work do you think you got done?	6	1
Look at him. He has the sea breeze in his hair.	6	1
You bring me something? Huh?	6	1
Dictaphone, cocktail napkins?	6	1
Anything to give me a jump on the Royal Hawaiian?	6	1
I had an experience.	6	1
I don't know how to put it into words.	6	1
Isn't Sheraton coming in on Friday?	6	1
He's still thinking. He just got back.	6	1
I'll tell you the experience.	6	1
Megan in a bikini.	6	1
Oh, Mr. Draper. There you are.	6	1
Good morning. How was your trip?	6	1
It was good, thank you. What's going on here?	6	1
They're taking portraits for publicity.	6	1
You certainly look snappy. I see you have coffee.	6	1
I scheduled you later in case you missed the connection in Los Angeles.	6	1
Everything went smoothly.	6	1
Welcome back.	6	1
I'm jealous just looking at you.	6	1
- I think you'd like it. - I don't know if it's the photographers	6	1
or the writers, but it really smells like reefer in here.	6	1
That has to be enough.	6	1
I think we got it.	6	1
So, they treat you like King Kamehameha?	6	1
Miss, you mind?	6	1
Are these in color?	6	1
No, and I'm starting to regret it.	6	1
Do you mind holding onto the rail, gorgeous?	6	1
Think of important things.	6	1
Caroline, is the shoeshine here yet?	6	1
No one's going to see your shoes.	6	1
- I want you to call him. - I did.	6	1
So, Don Ho...	6	1
did you have a blue drink in the white sand?	6	1
Ernest Borgnine chase you down an alleyway with a switchblade?	6	1
I love that movie.	6	1
It was nice.	6	1
I think I'm next, but I don't want to follow that act.	6	1
So, you have anything ready for Sheraton on Friday?	6	1
Have I ever walked into this office after an absence	6	1
and not had you bring up business immediately?	6	1
That's only because I've spent every holiday	6	1
waiting on work from you.	6	1
And then you walk away from me.	6	1
And then you take a nap.	6	1
Oh, taking pictures.	6	1
Yeah, we'll be done in a second.	6	1
Keep it down out here.	6	1
Oh, about your office.	6	1
They think it's better for the pictures.	6	1
I don't agree.	6	1
They'll move it back.	6	1
So when I left, where was I?	6	1
I'll get you the files.	6	1
As horrible as this is,	6	1
I don't think anyone has made this connection	6	1
outside of this comedian.	6	1
So it's likely that any possible controversy--	6	1
Well, no one's seen the TV spot.	6	1
They've seen the print for three weeks,	6	1
side by side with the news story probably.	6	1
We haven't heard a peep.	6	1
So the controversy is still in your imagination.	6	1
I won't deny that, but this is a horrible thing.	6	1
I believe that's the word I used.	6	1
So?	6	1
- I thought I had a solution. - We can't pull the ad.	6	1
Relax, Burt. And of course we can't.	6	1
No, I thought maybe we could just cut	6	1
"""Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears"""	6	1
and just start with saying	6	1
all the great stuff about the headphones.	6	1
That's a great idea.	6	1
- You think so? - I think it's the first idea, but--	6	1
It solves everything.	6	1
Except it's just a man in a toga now. It's a non sequitur.	6	1
Maybe people will think it's some kind	6	1
of sophisticated joke that they just didn't get.	6	1
I think that while it avoids	6	1
any possibility of controversy, it neuters the joke.	6	1
What the hell does that mean?	6	1
Look, you don't know what to do.	6	1
I'm telling you what do to.	6	1
You are. You have solved the problem.	6	1
But it needs more than a solution.	6	1
It needs to be a great ad.	6	1
This is a great place to start. I just need a little time.	6	1
Remember how long it took us to come up with this one?	6	1
I don't know. It just sort of came to you, didn't it?	6	1
No, you rejected a lot of things.	6	1
And we can't shoot one of the things I rejected?	6	1
We just don't have the time.	6	1
Look, my job is to introduce your headphones	6	1
to a huge, drunk, male audience.	6	1
And it's not about my work,	6	1
it's about making a great ad.	6	1
The association not being with Vietnam,	6	1
but with a laugh, a smile,	6	1
that all comes from your headphones.	6	1
I don't know how to do that.	6	1
But I do.	6	1
Give me a couple days.	6	1
Okay.	6	1
You've got to get a hold of Ted.	6	1
"Why do they all have ""love"" in them?"	6	1
- They asked for it. - It's a big word.	6	1
I guess they heard it on the news.	6	1
_	6	1
- What the hell is this? - They're newlyweds.	6	1
This couple doesn't exist.	6	1
Anything matrimonial feels Paleolithic.	6	1
What are you suggesting? A little Haight-Ashbury colonial?	6	1
A couple of longhairs in love? That'll get Dow going.	6	1
As much as I'd like to join all the ads making fun	6	1
of the ubiquitous San Francisco hippie,	6	1
"let's try to trade on the word ""love"" as something substantial."	6	1
I don't think that's possible in this context.	6	1
So why are we contributing to the trivialization of the word?	6	1
It doesn't belong in the kitchen.	6	1
"""I love this."" ""I love my oven."""	6	1
"""You know what I'd love? I'd love a hamburger."" We're wearing it out."	6	1
Let's leave it where we want it.	6	1
We want that electric jolt to the body.	6	1
We want Eros. It's like a drug.	6	1
It's not domestic.	6	1
What's the difference between a husband	6	1
knocking on a door and a sailor getting off a ship?	6	1
About 10,000 volts.	6	1
- Excuse me. - Oh.	6	1
- Don't let me interrupt. - No, we were...	6	1
just finishing up here.	6	1
These are great.	6	1
Good to hear.	6	1
- This is a pleasant surprise. - I got out early.	6	1
- Is that good or bad? - What?	6	1
Oh, no. Everything's fine. It was routine.	6	1
Well...	6	1
welcome to my hospital.	6	1
You want a coffee or something?	6	1
No.	6	1
This is quite a spread.	6	1
Well, let's get you set up.	6	1
If I looked like you and talked like that,	6	1
I wouldn't have had to go to medical school.	6	1
Please, don't compare what I do to what you do.	6	1
I'm not. Just part of me was hoping that head was empty.	6	1
Can't resist cutting people open, can you?	6	1
All right, enough flirting. Where's my camera?	6	1
I think this is the best one.	6	1
I don't know what to say.	6	1
Say you're gonna be the first American	6	1
to complete a successful heart transplant	6	1
and that you'll appear in a magazine ad attributing your success to your Leica.	6	1
Well, if that's the only way you can give it to me.	6	1
- I was looking for you. - Here I am.	6	1
Dr. Arnold Rosen.	6	1
Sorry, this is Miss Chambers, my secretary.	6	1
I'm sorry, Dr. Rosen. I didn't know you were coming by.	6	1
Oh, no, it's not business. He's a friend.	6	1
They're ready in your office.	6	1
- Who? - They're setting up.	6	1
- The photographer. - I'll do it.	6	1
No, you're gonna need a couple weeks with those instructions.	6	1
This'll only take a minute. Have you had lunch?	6	1
No, I have a full afternoon.	6	1
But I think our wives are cooking something up for New Year's.	6	1
Told Sylvia to keep it in the building.	6	1
Wasn't my idea.	6	1
No, it'll be fun.	6	1
As long as I don't have to put on shoes, it sounds perfect.	6	1
And again, thanks for the toy.	6	1
See, but I'm free tonight.	6	1
So call in sick.	6	1
It's easier for them to replace you than me.	6	1
Don't get out of bed yet.	6	1
Yes?	6	1
I hate to disturb you, but it's very urgent.	6	1
Okay, okay, sit down.	6	1
I have to hang up. Looks like something bad happened.	6	1
Well, let me know if your situation changes. Bye.	6	1
Okay. Bye.	6	1
Bye. Bye.	6	1
What the hell is going on?	6	1
I got some tragic news. You should sit down.	6	1
I'll be fine.	6	1
Here.	6	1
Your Aunt Jessica called.	6	1
That's what I hung up for?	6	1
Your mother passed away this morning.	6	1
Caroline, honey,	6	1
she was 91 years old.	6	1
It's hardly a shock.	6	1
She was such a sweet woman and I know how close you were.	6	1
For 20 years, she's been saying this is her last Christmas.	6	1
She was always so polite to me	6	1
when she could hear me.	6	1
So I suppose I'm in charge of the arrangements.	6	1
You want to call your aunt back?	6	1
Nah. She's a fruitcake.	6	1
She'll want to have a séance.	6	1
Did she say what happened?	6	1
She had a stroke	6	1
in the bathroom.	6	1
Well, I asked, didn't I?	6	1
Talk to Joan. She'll know what to do.	6	1
Okay, okay.	6	1
Okay. You're gonna be okay.	6	1
Cheers.	6	1
Ah, yes. This is Peggy Olson	6	1
and I'm calling for Mr. Chaough.	6	1
Yes, this is Peggy Olson.	6	1
Let's not exaggerate. I've only called twice.	6	1
Look, Father--	6	1
oh, I'm sorry, Pastor.	6	1
I was raised Catholic.	6	1
Well, because my mother is.	6	1
My father is Lutheran.	6	1
Irish and Norwegian.	6	1
No, he passed away.	6	1
He was cremated.	6	1
Look, Pastor, I'm not saying	6	1
that you didn't give Mr. Chaough the message,	6	1
I'm just saying that it bears some urgency.	6	1
Yes, which is to say I don't think it would bother him at all	6	1
to know that I'm on the phone.	6	1
Certainly. Do you have a pen?	6	1
This is Peggy Olson	6	1
and I'm calling about the Super Bowl.	6	1
I'm in the office, he has the number.	6	1
How could you possibly have written that down that fast?	6	1
I don't know. I think it's gonna be Oakland or Houston against Green Bay.	6	1
And also with you.	6	1
Good night.	6	1
Phyllis, can I get some coffee?	6	1
It's gone cold.	6	1
Is this really necessary?	6	1
I just got back from Hawaii.	6	1
You're backlit,	6	1
so even with the tan you look like you haven't slept.	6	1
Don't roll down the sleeves. Roll them up.	6	1
- Really? - You know what, Chico?	6	1
Forget the tripod. Give me the camera.	6	1
Ahem.	6	1
What do I do?	6	1
I want to see you lost in that confident thought.	6	1
I want to see the brains behind this operation.	6	1
Well, for one thing, I'd be behind the desk	6	1
and my desk would be over there.	6	1
Just do what you do.	6	1
Give me a minute.	6	1
That's good.	6	1
_	6	1
_	6	1
What's wrong?	6	1
"Give me a little ""Front Page."""	6	1
You know, hands on the desk looking for an answer out that window.	6	1
What?	6	1
What do you want?	6	1
I want you to be yourself.	6	1
Sorry to wake you when you're finally sleeping,	6	1
but I waited as long as I could.	6	1
What time is it?	6	1
They called me and they want me to work today.	6	1
I told them about the funeral, but they can't move it to tomorrow	6	1
because they'll need me then, too.	6	1
In fact, they need me for the rest of the week.	6	1
That's good, isn't it?	6	1
I called Jeff Hunter, but I think his service won't wake him.	6	1
Isn't an agent supposed to call you?	6	1
Good news will keep.	6	1
I feel awful about the funeral.	6	1
Will you please give Roger my condolences?	6	1
Of course.	6	1
You should get some sleep.	6	1
How can I? My wife's a big TV star.	6	1
Get some sleep.	6	1
Break a leg.	6	1
Why are you eating? Sandy's coming over for lunch.	6	1
First of all, I don't know why you're counting my meals.	6	1
And second of all, Sandy's not coming over.	6	1
Oh. That's a shame.	6	1
Is she sick?	6	1
Sick of being here.	6	1
She went to Juilliard early.	6	1
She did?	6	1
When?	6	1
Did you want her to say a tearful goodbye to you?	6	1
Well, frankly, yes.	6	1
Consider yourself lucky.	6	1
She was so stuck-up.	6	1
She kept saying how she really was going	6	1
"to ""look back on this time fondly."""	6	1
I can't believe she did that.	6	1
She acts like she's 25 because she uses tampons.	6	1
Sally, please.	6	1
Did she give you her address?	6	1
Can you drive Jackie and me to the movies?	6	1
This is a great vacation.	6	1
You know, she was like a sister to me.	6	1
A much older sister.	6	1
How she could have a boy your age, I don't know.	6	1
You could be her grandson.	6	1
You need to get your eyes checked.	6	1
- These are stunning rooms. - Thank you.	6	1
He is so handsome.	6	1
I swear you have not aged a day.	6	1
Oh, Jane, darling.	6	1
- Thank you for coming. - I thought I should.	6	1
Excuse me. Excuse me. I would like to speak first.	6	1
I think you just did.	6	1
No, the eulogies. The remarks.	6	1
- I wish to go first. - Of course. Of course.	6	1
If you need to speak to me, I understand.	6	1
Thank you for rescuing me.	6	1
- From your admirers? - You look wonderful.	6	1
I don't know if you remember, but I have her ring.	6	1
I don't know if you want it back.	6	1
What am I gonna do with it?	6	1
For Margaret or...	6	1
I don't know, to bury her in it.	6	1
We already burned her up. They steal that stuff anyway.	6	1
Just keep it. She liked you.	6	1
You always paid your rent on time.	6	1
Do you want the victuals in the parlor?	6	1
What?	6	1
Hold on, I didn't order any of this.	6	1
It's supposed to be tea and petits fours.	6	1
Oh, hell, put it in the dining room.	6	1
- I'm really sorry for your loss. - She was a great lady.	6	1
"""Bob Benson, SCDP."" Who the hell is that?"	6	1
That's from us.	6	1
Daddy, I think it's time.	6	1
What's the rush?	6	1
Thank you for coming.	6	1
God, she is all kinds of trouble, isn't she?	6	1
Everything turns you on, doesn't it?	6	1
Is your mother still alive?	6	1
- Did I miss anything? - You're just in time.	6	1
How many funerals have you been to today?	6	1
- Excuse me? - He wants to know where you got the drink.	6	1
Give my regards to Megan.	6	1
Rumor has it they're gonna move her to four days a week.	6	1
Legend has it.	6	1
So, is she alive?	6	1
Yes, she is.	6	1
Don, what about your mother?	6	1
Still with us?	6	1
I'm gonna watch from over there.	6	1
If I could get your attention.	6	1
I'd like to thank everyone for coming.	6	1
I apologize for the dry atmosphere,	6	1
but as I've been reminded many times today,	6	1
Mother did not approve of libations.	6	1
Excuse me, but I have a few words to say.	6	1
I insist.	6	1
Of course. Why don't you roll on over here?	6	1
Can everyone forget what I've said so far	6	1
so that Mrs. Hazel Tinsley, who graciously flew up	6	1
from Palm Beach, can have the honor of going first?	6	1
Stay here.	6	1
I want to say something, if I may,	6	1
at this informal moment	6	1
because I do not believe in speaking graveside.	6	1
This is where she lived and this is where she died.	6	1
"""This woman spent 90 years on the Earth,"	6	1
of noble birth and of some advantage,	6	1
devoting herself to one man, but loving another.	6	1
"That man was Roger."" That's you."	6	1
"""When Roger Sterling Sr.'s brief time was over,"	6	1
it was this Roger who filled her days.	6	1
One could not talk to her without hearing about his achievements,	6	1
his wit, his kindness.	6	1
We all said, 'Mimsy.	6	1
Mims, you should find another man. Life is long.'	6	1
She said, 'I don't need anyone.	6	1
"My heart is full because my son is my sunshine.'"""	6	1
Get him out of here.	6	1
Sorry. I'm sorry.	6	1
Where were you?	6	1
I'm sorry, but is that man all right?	6	1
- What's he doing here? - What?	6	1
- You heard me. - Can we get someone in here to clean up?	6	1
- Let Bruce Pike clean it up. - Roger.	6	1
I just wanted to pay my respects.	6	1
I think it would have been more respectful	6	1
of you not to come. She didn't like you either.	6	1
I don't think I ever met your mother.	6	1
She wouldn't if she had. This is supposed to be just family.	6	1
- See how upset everybody is? - Roger, stop. Stop it this minute.	6	1
- You shouldn't have brought him. - Daddy, please.	6	1
This is my funeral!	6	1
You know what? Party's over.	6	1
Everybody out.	6	1
Thank you very much. Out!	6	1
Thank you.	6	1
Pardon me. I'm looking for someone.	6	1
Could you help me?	6	1
Everybody's gone.	6	1
Not everybody, obviously.	6	1
I think they were overwhelmed by that touching tribute.	6	1
What do you want?	6	1
That man never tires of embarrassing himself.	6	1
You're the one who brought him.	6	1
I'm talking about Don.	6	1
Oh. He was just saying what everybody else was thinking.	6	1
You shouldn't have brought him.	6	1
You're right.	6	1
Now you have one on me. Do you feel better?	6	1
My mother's dead.	6	1
I know, Roger.	6	1
Must be very hard for you.	6	1
I don't feel anything.	6	1
You certainly seem emotional.	6	1
Because I need a drink.	6	1
She lived a long time.	6	1
And she knew that you loved her.	6	1
So maybe there's nothing to drink about.	6	1
I feel like she always wanted to spend time with me and I never did.	6	1
That may be something to consider.	6	1
You have a family.	6	1
Are you kidding me? I looked out at that crowd	6	1
and all I saw was a bunch more women I've disappointed.	6	1
Roger Sterling, no matter what you do,	6	1
everyone loves you.	6	1
What you're seeing is them worried about how you feel about them.	6	1
So, you miss me?	6	1
I know your daughter does.	6	1
Don't you wonder what Margaret will say at your funeral?	6	1
You had to bring that up.	6	1
I did.	6	1
You should spend more time with her.	6	1
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	6	1
Remember the last time this bed was covered in furs?	6	1
We rolled around all over them.	6	1
- What are you doing? - I don't know.	6	1
You look great.	6	1
It would be soothing.	6	1
Soothe yourself.	6	1
I'm gonna clean up.	6	1
Jonesy.	6	1
Mr. Draper, are you all right?	6	1
- He's not feeling well. - Hey, Jonesy.	6	1
Jonesy, what did you see?	6	1
I didn't see nothing, Mr. Draper.	6	1
No, no, when you died, what did you see?	6	1
- Don, let's get you upstairs. - Wait, I want to know.	6	1
I want to know.	6	1
What did you see when you died?	6	1
I don't know. Doc said I wasn't really dead.	6	1
I saw it. You were dead. He died right there.	6	1
What did you see?	6	1
I don't like to think about it.	6	1
- You must have seen something. - I guess there was a light.	6	1
Was it like hot, tropical sunshine?	6	1
- I don't know. - Did you hear the ocean?	6	1
Mr. Draper, you should go upstairs.	6	1
- Is he all right? - He'll be fine.	6	1
- Excuse me. - Yeah?	6	1
- Is that St. Mark's Place? - Yup.	6	1
I'm sorry, I'm looking for someone.	6	1
A girl.	6	1
- Which one? - This one.	6	1
There's lots of chicks that come in and out of here.	6	1
I've been in the buildings across the street. Are you sure you haven't seen her?	6	1
Look, lady, it's cold as a witch's tit. We're going inside.	6	1
May I?	6	1
Door's always open, man.	6	1
Hey, I got the pork butt	6	1
and I lifted a bunch of onions.	6	1
Sandy?	6	1
Sandy?	6	1
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.	6	1
I'm sorry to bother you again,	6	1
but this violin, this belongs to the girl	6	1
I was talking about. Are you sure you haven't seen her?	6	1
Look, lady, I don't want to have to lay the regular rap on you,	6	1
but I am exhausted from telling people like you	6	1
- I haven't seen people like her. - But she was here.	6	1
I haven't seen your daughter.	6	1
She's not my daughter.	6	1
So, what are you, some kind of social worker?	6	1
Her violin teacher?	6	1
Shit. What's her name?	6	1
Sandy.	6	1
Hey, anybody seen Sandy?	6	1
Do you know how to make goulash?	6	1
'Cause I've got pork butt, two onions, and lentils	6	1
which I think is what's in it.	6	1
Hey, Moon, turn around.	6	1
And paprika. I know that's in it.	6	1
Well, for one thing, you'll need a pot.	6	1
We got a pot.	6	1
You'll have to wash it out.	6	1
There's no water.	6	1
Really?	6	1
We used to use the hose at the Episcopal church,	6	1
but now the pipes are frozen.	6	1
It was great here all summer. It was hot.	6	1
So much rather be hot than cold.	6	1
I'll go on the roof and get a chunk of snow.	6	1
- Oh, you'll get sick. - We do it all the time.	6	1
My mom makes great goulash.	6	1
- Where are you from? - Everywhere.	6	1
Hold on.	6	1
I think there's an army knife by the bed.	6	1
Hello?	6	1
Your mother still here?	6	1
No. She left.	6	1
I'm just waiting for them to wrap up the deli.	6	1
Where's Skeezix?	6	1
Brooks took him bike riding.	6	1
It's kind of cold out there.	6	1
He can't tell the difference.	6	1
The other day he walked in singing	6	1
and I looked and his nose was bleeding.	6	1
He didn't know how he did it.	6	1
So he's tough.	6	1
Listen, I want you to have something.	6	1
This was your grandmother's.	6	1
My dad brought it back for her.	6	1
He went everywhere.	6	1
- What is it? - It's water from the River Jordan.	6	1
I was baptized with it. So were you.	6	1
We would have used it on Ellery, but I guess she forgot.	6	1
Hope she didn't put her teeth in it.	6	1
Well, thank you. It's lovely.	6	1
Did Nana Mimsy leave me anything else?	6	1
I'm afraid she left everything to the zoo.	6	1
She's making them name the animals.	6	1
I'm sorry.	6	1
That doesn't seem funny to me.	6	1
It does to me.	6	1
Her will looked like the manifest from Noah's ark.	6	1
Well, it's different for you.	6	1
Brooks didn't start off where you did.	6	1
- He'll get there. - Oh, I know he will.	6	1
It's just that there's--	6	1
well, Daddy, there's this opportunity.	6	1
I don't know, I--	6	1
I told Nana about it,	6	1
but obviously she didn't understand.	6	1
Were you this specific?	6	1
Daddy, don't.	6	1
It's not good for you.	6	1
I worry.	6	1
Refrigeration.	6	1
It's the wave of the future, Daddy.	6	1
They can transport fruit all the way from California	6	1
in just four days and it doesn't go bad.	6	1
Some of these trucks can carry 20 tons.	6	1
And, of course, you're buying the technology	6	1
for the refrigerated trucks, so it doesn't matter what they get used for.	6	1
It's really not Brooks' problem.	6	1
Well, I guess you should have Brooks talk to me about it.	6	1
Of course.	6	1
I know he'd like to make it on his own, but--	6	1
I'd have to see something on paper.	6	1
Oh, he's got that, believe me.	6	1
Well, good.	6	1
And I'm glad we had this little chat.	6	1
Oh, Daddy.	6	1
I'm going to go see if they're done in the kitchen.	6	1
Don?	6	1
Don?	6	1
Did you make it to the memorial?	6	1
Except for the mess, you're exactly where I left you.	6	1
I put in an appearance. I just should have had lunch.	6	1
Aspirin?	6	1
I'm better now. You?	6	1
Well, I pushed Derek's mother down the stairs.	6	1
- Did you? - I did.	6	1
They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes,	6	1
but I don't know how close the camera was	6	1
because it was a stuntman in a dress.	6	1
Don't worry. I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.	6	1
I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.	6	1
Yes, they will.	6	1
So you'll still love me	6	1
even if I'm a lying, cheating whore?	6	1
But I'm gonna walk behind you on the stairs.	6	1
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make you dinner.	6	1
Oh, Rosa found this in the garbage.	6	1
I think she was afraid you'd think she was stealing.	6	1
Sleep. I'll come get you.	6	1
Hey, Danny, where'd you take that joint?	6	1
There's three fucking rooms. Where do you think I am?	6	1
No, thank you.	6	1
Is marijuana expensive?	6	1
Do I have to stir it again?	6	1
- Is it boiling? - No.	6	1
- My coat smells like onions. Yoo-hoo.	6	1
You better tell him you did the cooking, man. It's your job.	6	1
It's my bag.	6	1
- It smells good. - I made goulash.	6	1
- Did you get Wonder Bread? - We got batteries.	6	1
Hey, Zal, did you make any friends today?	6	1
Did you run into this chick? What's her name?	6	1
I'm sorry. This violin belongs	6	1
to my friend Sandy. Do you know when she'll be back?	6	1
Sorry, Blondie, but that violin belongs to me.	6	1
No, I know the girl who plays this violin and I'm looking for her.	6	1
Yeah, no, I saw her. She sold it to me.	6	1
She's trying to get enough bread to go to California.	6	1
Says it's too cold.	6	1
So where is she now?	6	1
- Does she owe you money? - No.	6	1
Well, your daughter's long gone, Blondie, so why don't you run along?	6	1
- Come on, Zal. - Why are you being so rude?	6	1
Why can't you leave her be? Kills you to be out of control.	6	1
Well, someone needs to control this mess.	6	1
Lady, we have to take everything the Establishment throws away.	6	1
That's all that's left.	6	1
What you can't grok is that we are your garbage.	6	1
You don't want this house, you don't want us.	6	1
You're not allowed to ask anybody to leave.	6	1
The bylaws say if someone is a nuisance	6	1
or a narc, that shall not be observed.	6	1
I'm obviously not the people you're talking about.	6	1
I came here because I'm looking for someone that I do want.	6	1
I did not throw her away.	6	1
Yeah, you're a goodie. I can tell.	6	1
Look at this. She's got 80 bucks.	6	1
- Can I have it? - No. That's all they care about.	6	1
Well, Miss Elizabeth Hofstadt Francis	6	1
of Rye, New York,	6	1
eyes blue, hair bottled,	6	1
we don't like your life any more than you do.	6	1
You have bad manners.	6	1
You deserve to live in the street of this pigsty,	6	1
and I hope you get tetanus or crabs or whatever else is crawling around here.	6	1
Hey, that's my violin.	6	1
She sold it? I don't believe you.	6	1
You want it? I'll give it to you for 10.	6	1
What are you going to do with a violin?	6	1
Gonna learn how to play it.	6	1
Because it's so easy.	6	1
There's a meatball, which is probably cold by now,	6	1
and an Italian, which is probably even colder.	6	1
You're typing a lot. You got a new way to go?	6	1
No, I'm doing this thing Don used to do.	6	1
I'm writing a letter to a fictitious acquaintance	6	1
telling her how great my new headphones are.	6	1
Well, I hate that it gives you extra work,	6	1
but I think it's about time	6	1
this unjust war is finally having an impact on commerce.	6	1
Meatball.	6	1
- Did we order dinner? - No.	6	1
I can share.	6	1
Try the headphones again. Try and think of some words.	6	1
- What have you got? - We have three very different angles.	6	1
If you dip the audio in the wide shot,	6	1
Mark Antony is just, you know,	6	1
"mouthing the ""lend me your ears"" part."	6	1
You hear the announcer say one of these things--	6	1
"One. ""Are you ready for the sound for the ages?"""	6	1
"Two. ""Koss knows that good sound is timeless."""	6	1
"Or ""Ladies and gentlemen,"	6	1
"this is not your old-fashioned sound."""	6	1
What's the next one?	6	1
- The next one or the second one? - You said you had three.	6	1
Those were three. Didn't I read all of them?	6	1
Those are three different versions of the same idea.	6	1
If you can't tell the difference between which part's the idea	6	1
and which part's the execution of the idea, you're of no use to me.	6	1
I know what you're doing. I've been you.	6	1
You're hoping this sparks my imagination	6	1
"and then you can say, ""Wow, she's a genius,"""	6	1
or say anything because you want to go home.	6	1
I think they're very different from each other.	6	1
Well, I'm sorry to point it out,	6	1
but you're walking over the same ground.	6	1
When you bring me something like this, it looks like cowardice.	6	1
Here, you can split this 'cause you're not going home.	6	1
What do you think?	6	1
What?	6	1
- How do they sound? - Scared. You were a little rough.	6	1
No, the headphones. Don't worry about them.	6	1
Some workers don't respond to that.	6	1
Look, Abe, I don't need another negative voice.	6	1
"And those, quote, ""workers"" aren't surprised that I'm frustrated"	6	1
because they know that they're lazy.	6	1
Sorry. I didn't know what kind of abuse	6	1
was required to get into the frat.	6	1
Listen to your music, kid.	6	1
Because you laughed at him.	6	1
Yes, they like that.	6	1
Hello.	6	1
Where you been?	6	1
I had some errands to run.	6	1
Well, I know what somebody's getting next Christmas.	6	1
Did you eat?	6	1
Chicken salad.	6	1
That's a relief, because my feet are frozen.	6	1
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	6	1
Morning. How are we today?	6	1
- Fine, thank you. - You're welcome.	6	1
Seeing as how you were under the weather,	6	1
I just wanted to remind you about Jules and Terry from Sheraton later.	6	1
Cancel.	6	1
Their bosses are coming back next week	6	1
and they just sent you on a very expensive trip.	6	1
Would you get Stan in here?	6	1
Oh, listen.	6	1
I got this by mistake. It belongs to some private.	6	1
See if you can find out some way to get it to his division.	6	1
I will. Do you want to enclose a note?	6	1
Nah. I found it on a barstool.	6	1
I mean, you've got to be on my side here, right?	6	1
First my ex-wife works the body with a brutal guilt attack	6	1
and then my daughter works the wallet like a speed bag.	6	1
You want me on your side?	6	1
- You have kids? - We're not talking about me.	6	1
You know, I used to jump off mountains.	6	1
It never occurred to me I had this invisible parachute.	6	1
My mother loved me in some completely pointless way	6	1
and it's gone. So there it is.	6	1
She gave me my last new experience.	6	1
And now I know that all I'm going to be doing	6	1
from here on is losing everything.	6	1
You feel loss.	6	1
Damn it, how many times do I have to say this?	6	1
I don't feel anything.	6	1
I'm just acknowledging that life,	6	1
unlike this analysis, will eventually end	6	1
and somebody else will get the bill.	6	1
- Good morning, Ken. - Good morning, Bob.	6	1
What are you doing out here?	6	1
You have a meeting with someone important?	6	1
No, but are you looking for me?	6	1
I'll drop everything. I just came out here to enjoy the light.	6	1
Oh, I thought maybe you were out here	6	1
greeting customers for your catering business.	6	1
- What are you talking about? - You know exactly.	6	1
I'm sorry, are you cross with me?	6	1
Someone sent a royal spread to Sterling's.	6	1
It had a card on it with your name.	6	1
Oh, that. It just seemed the thing to do.	6	1
Well, it was too much.	6	1
It was almost like you were invited, but you weren't.	6	1
I guess I was just remembering when my father died.	6	1
Any gesture meant something to me.	6	1
There wasn't supposed to be a card.	6	1
Okay.	6	1
Well, take your work and go back to your office.	6	1
Sitting out here makes people think you have nothing to do,	6	1
and I suspect you're hoping it's the opposite.	6	1
I guess it's time to catch up on my phone calls.	6	1
Look, we're sorry we had to squeeze in this meeting between the holidays.	6	1
We're obviously not expecting a full presentation.	6	1
Well, I can say with all honesty that Don	6	1
has not stopped talking about your incredible property.	6	1
I never stayed at the Royal, but I shipped out of Pearl in 1943	6	1
and, I've got to say, I can still smell the gardenias.	6	1
Thank you for that. Don?	6	1
So, Bob Grange and his delightful wife Patty	6	1
saw to our every need and also missed no opportunity	6	1
to expose us to the unique local flavor.	6	1
Lucky Bob. I tried to get that job,	6	1
but unfortunately I got promoted.	6	1
Well, I've just come back	6	1
and I'm not sure how much I've talked about it,	6	1
but there is a feeling that's stayed with me.	6	1
I've been in the winter.	6	1
It's quite a shock coming back.	6	1
Well put. But that could be any vacation.	6	1
This was very, very different.	6	1
I think we're not selling a geographical location.	6	1
We're selling an experience.	6	1
It's not just a different place,	6	1
you are different.	6	1
And you'd think there'd be an unsettling feeling	6	1
about something so drastically different, but there's something else.	6	1
You don't miss anything. You're not homesick.	6	1
It puts you in this state.	6	1
The air and the water	6	1
are all the same temperature as your body.	6	1
It's sensory-- the music, the fragrance,	6	1
the breeze, and the blue. Stan.	6	1
Ahem.	6	1
It's just a sketch.	6	1
Hawaiian legend has it that the soul	6	1
can go in and out of the body,	6	1
but that it usually leaves from a leeward point into the waves.	6	1
"""Hawaii. The jumping off point."""	6	1
So what happened to him?	6	1
He got off the plane, took a deep breath,	6	1
shed his skin, and jumped off.	6	1
I assume this is a photograph.	6	1
More color. That water is transparent.	6	1
Well, I suppose it reminds me a little of the cinema.	6	1
But mostly I see James Mason	6	1
- at the end of that movie walking into the sea. - What is that movie?	6	1
I'm not sure I know what you're taking about.	6	1
He's killing himself. I don't think they show it,	6	1
but he's going to swim out until he can't swim back.	6	1
That may be a personal association for you,	6	1
but that's not what this means.	6	1
We looked at this. None of us thought of that.	6	1
"""A Star is Born."""	6	1
The copy is all about the Hawaiian legend.	6	1
Aloha means hello and goodbye.	6	1
I'm sorry, but this is very poetic.	6	1
- Thank you. - Where's our hotel?	6	1
Where's the Pink Palace and Diamond Head?	6	1
You got to have Diamond Head in the shot.	6	1
Anyone can do that.	6	1
I don't agree.	6	1
Well, there's no reason we can't tilt the camera up 45 degrees	6	1
and see the husk of our city dweller on the sand	6	1
and an arm of the hotel and Diamond Head in the background.	6	1
So there would be a man in this photo	6	1
and he most likely would be naked?	6	1
Actually, my first thought is there is no man.	6	1
Just his footprints. What happened to him?	6	1
I think, and I think people might think,	6	1
that he died.	6	1
Maybe he did and he went to heaven.	6	1
Maybe that's what this feels like.	6	1
- It's a little morbid. - Well, heaven's a little morbid.	6	1
How do you get to heaven? Something terrible has to happen.	6	1
We don't want that in the ad.	6	1
Of course there's no doubt this concept itself	6	1
is merely a jumping off the point.	6	1
A picture of a hotel, even yours,	6	1
is easy to ignore.	6	1
This, or some version of this, demands your attention.	6	1
Well, you will continue to have our attention.	6	1
Make no mistake, we're not afraid of provocative.	6	1
So is there any time left for holiday plans for either of you?	6	1
- Happy New Year, everyone. - You as well.	6	1
What's the matter? You didn't get all your vomiting done	6	1
at my mother's funeral?	6	1
Roger, I apologize. I had a bug.	6	1
Yeah, well, you didn't miss anything.	6	1
Does that make you think of suicide?	6	1
Of course.	6	1
That's what's so great about it.	6	1
You know, we sold actual death	6	1
for 25 years with Lucky Strike.	6	1
You know how we did it? We ignored it.	6	1
Hold on.	6	1
Can I go to Becky's for New Year's Eve?	6	1
- Talk to your mother. - Can't you get a sitter?	6	1
Have your friend come here. You can bang pots and pans at midnight.	6	1
It's a party. They can't bring the whole party here.	6	1
I'll stay until 9:00. I'll put them to bed.	6	1
Hello.	6	1
Ask your mother. We're in here.	6	1
So?	6	1
Anything new?	6	1
I hate it. You're ugly.	6	1
What happened to you?	6	1
So?	6	1
Elizabeth Taylor,	6	1
what have you done with my wife?	6	1
You're free until lunch, but I have to tell you something.	6	1
Just a minute. What's that?	6	1
More bad news. Giorgio died.	6	1
His family sent over his shoeshine kit	6	1
because you were the only one who called about him.	6	1
What happened to him?	6	1
I didn't ask.	6	1
So the secret is to rub the pot with a clove of garlic	6	1
and then add twice the kirschwasser.	6	1
How wonderful that we can just stagger downstairs.	6	1
I might just get undressed in the elevator.	6	1
I don't know if I can make it to midnight,	6	1
but I do know we're not leaving here until those kids are in bed.	6	1
It's a beautiful fondue pot.	6	1
- Where'd you get it? - Bloomingdales.	6	1
The kitchen store. They have everything you could think of.	6	1
Not everything. Tell the story.	6	1
Well, there's a guy in my office.	6	1
He's very flamboyant and he got arrested there.	6	1
- Shoplifting? - No.	6	1
But he was caught red-handed.	6	1
Apparently the men's room	6	1
is a locale for a certain kind of assignation	6	1
and the store detective's always going in there and looking under the stall.	6	1
So, my regional sales manager	6	1
apparently takes two shopping bags,	6	1
puts his feet in them	6	1
while the love of his life sat on the john.	6	1
That is clever.	6	1
How the hell did he get caught?	6	1
How old are your children?	6	1
Um, 11 and seven.	6	1
Well, I might go kiss them good night.	6	1
Ours is a freshman at Michigan.	6	1
- He didn't even come home. - Oh, I'm not ready for that.	6	1
The house feels empty.	6	1
Then you get a phone bill.	6	1
Well, if everybody's had enough cheese,	6	1
I'm gonna switch to chocolate.	6	1
But first, because it looks like it's snowing,	6	1
I think it's time we all took a trip to Hawaii.	6	1
We're having such a good time.	6	1
It's all set up.	6	1
I want to go to Hawaii.	6	1
- Oh! - Ooh.	6	1
- Isn't it incredible? - Yeah.	6	1
Oh, let me explain.	6	1
I woke up in the morning and Don was at a wedding	6	1
giving away the bride.	6	1
That's romantic.	6	1
How did that happen?	6	1
So, of course, Kreutzer's yelling	6	1
"and Ginsberg says, ""I'm sorry, but what the hell do I know about ham?"""	6	1
How could they let him near clients? Haven't they learned?	6	1
Hey, do you think Joan and Roger are still sleeping together?	6	1
Because his mother croaked	6	1
and she completely ignored him.	6	1
I don't know. We don't even know if that really ever happened.	6	1
I've got pictures in my head.	6	1
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.	6	1
- You want some? - Very funny.	6	1
Hey, I'm not hanging up.	6	1
Happy New Year.	6	1
Ted. What are you doing here?	6	1
I heard there were four people in the office on New Year's Eve.	6	1
I figured I owed it to the team to at least stop by.	6	1
Oh, I'm just--	6	1
there's a-- did you get my message?	6	1
I received them all. And I apologize,	6	1
but it was sort of a retreat for my wife and I	6	1
and, well, apparently I work too much.	6	1
Well, you know the problem.	6	1
Yes. Any solutions?	6	1
There's one.	6	1
I found this thing.	6	1
- What is this? - It's an outtake.	6	1
He had his headset on and was clowning around.	6	1
There's two minutes of it.	6	1
Look at this guy. What a pain in the ass.	6	1
I was irritated about it on the day,	6	1
but now I'm a little excited.	6	1
I think you can show him making these faces,	6	1
with no music, and say something like,	6	1
"""Koss Headphones sound so sharp and clear,"	6	1
"you can actually see it."""	6	1
It always takes a crisis to sell work this good.	6	1
You think it's good?	6	1
Makes me smile more than the original.	6	1
- Do you want to see the new voice-over? - No.	6	1
Well, I hope I didn't ruin your evening.	6	1
Not mine, but there's people working out there, Peggy. It's New Year's Eve.	6	1
If you knew you had something, you should have let them go.	6	1
- They know they can go. - No, they don't.	6	1
Oh.	6	1
You're good in a crisis.	6	1
Thank you.	6	1
Happy New Year.	6	1
He likes you.	6	1
What did you hear?	6	1
All of it.	6	1
This is Galliano.	6	1
It's from Jonesy.	6	1
I'm glad he's giving presents to someone else.	6	1
I can't stand the constant bootlicking.	6	1
He's grateful.	6	1
- Cent'anni. - What does that mean?	6	1
It's Italian for l'chaim.	6	1
"It means ""100 years."""	6	1
What do you think Dave paid for their place?	6	1
Arnold, don't.	6	1
Fine. Don, what did you pay?	6	1
75.	6	1
Well, you're a floor higher than us.	6	1
Jesus. Syl, did you hear that?	6	1
Happy New Year.	6	1
We missed midnight. It's 1:00.	6	1
We missed it.	6	1
It's probably my mother.	6	1
Or Dave and Cathy.	6	1
Face down in the hall.	6	1
Hello?	6	1
Um, Arnie, it's the service.	6	1
Thank you.	6	1
Hello?	6	1
Okay.	6	1
All right, tell them I'm on my way.	6	1
I've got to go.	6	1
I need cigarettes. I'll walk you down.	6	1
It's 1:00 a.m. in a snowstorm	6	1
on a holiday on a Sunday.	6	1
You are never gonna get a cab.	6	1
Don't even try to talk him out of it.	6	1
- These them? - Yeah, you see the boots?	6	1
What is it like to have someone's life in your hands?	6	1
Well, it's a privilege and an honor	6	1
to be trusted with that responsibility.	6	1
There they are.	6	1
Look at that.	6	1
Time to quit smoking.	6	1
It's a good resolution.	6	1
Well...	6	1
that's one lucky patient.	6	1
Honestly, Don, the whole life-and-death thing,	6	1
it doesn't bother me. It never has.	6	1
Guys like us, that's why we get paid.	6	1
- Us? - Fine.	6	1
You get paid to think about things they don't want to think about	6	1
and I get paid to not think about them.	6	1
People will do anything to alleviate their anxiety.	6	1
Did you read my Dante?	6	1
It made me think of you.	6	1
I don't know how to take that.	6	1
It's beautiful.	6	1
What do you want for this year?	6	1
I want to stop doing this.	6	1
I know.	6	1

Sorry to wake you when you're finally sleeping...	6	2
but I waited as long as I could.	6	2
What time is it?	6	2
They called me and they want me to work today.	6	2
I told them about the funeral, but they can't move it to tomorrow...	6	2
because they'll need me then too.	6	2
In fact, they need me for the rest of the week.	6	2
That's good, isn't it?	6	2
I called Jeff Hunter, but I think his service won't wake him.	6	2
Isn't an agent supposed to call you?	6	2
 Good news will keep.	6	2
I feel awful about the funeral.	6	2
Will you please give Roger my condolences?	6	2
Of course.	6	2
You should get some sleep.	6	2
How can I? My wife's a big TV star.	6	2
Get some sleep.	6	2
Break a leg.	6	2
- [Sighs] - [Door Closes]	6	2
[Sighs]	6	2
Why are you eating? Sandy's coming over for lunch.	6	2
First of all, I don't know why you're counting my meals.	6	2
And second of all, Sandy's not coming over.	6	2
Oh. That's a shame.	6	2
 Is she sick?	6	2
Sick of being here.	6	2
She went to Juilliard early.	6	2
She did?	6	2
When?	6	2
Did you want her to say a tearful good-bye to you?	6	2
Well, frankly, yes.	6	2
Consider yourself lucky.	6	2
She was so stuck-up.	6	2
She kept saying how she really was going...	6	2
"to ""look back on this time fondly."""	6	2
I can't believe she did that.	6	2
She acts like she's 25 because she uses tampons.	6	2
Sally, please.	6	2
Did she give you her address?	6	2
Can you drive Jackie and me to the movies?	6	2
This is a great vacation.	6	2
- [Whirring] - [TV playing, Indistinct]	6	2
- By the way, that, uh... [Indistinct] - [Whirring Continues]	6	2
You know, she was like a sister to me.	6	2
A much older sister.	6	2
How she could have a boy your age, I don't know.	6	2
- You could be her grandson. - [Doorbell Rings]	6	2
[Chuckles] You need to get your eyes checked.	6	2
- These are stunning rooms. - Thank you.	6	2
He is so handsome.	6	2
I swear you have not aged a day.	6	2
Oh, Jane, darling.	6	2
- Thank you for coming. - I thought I should.	6	2
Excuse me. Excuse me. I would like to speak first.	6	2
I think you just did.	6	2
No, the eulogies. The remarks. I wish to go first.	6	2
Of course. Of course.	6	2
If you need to speak to me, I understand.	6	2
Thank you for rescuing me.	6	2
- From your admirers? - You look wonderful.	6	2
I don't know if you remember, but I have her ring. I don't know if you want it back.	6	2
What am I gonna do with it?	6	2
- For Margaret or... - [Doorbell Rings]	6	2
I don't know, to bury her in it.	6	2
We already burned her up. They steal that stuff anyway. Just keep it. She liked you.	6	2
You always paid your rent on time.	6	2
Do you want the victuals in the parlor?	6	2
What?	6	2
Hold on, I didn't order any of this.	6	2
It's supposed to be tea and petits fours.	6	2
Oh, hell, put it in the dining room.	6	2
- I'm really sorry for your loss. - She was a great lady.	6	2
"""Bob Benson, S.C.D.P."" Who the hell is that?"	6	2
That's from us.	6	2
Daddy, I think it's time.	6	2
What's the rush?	6	2
Thank you for coming.	6	2
- God, she is all kinds of trouble, isn't she? - [Doorbell Rings]	6	2
Everything turns you on, doesn't it?	6	2
Is your mother still alive?	6	2
- Did I miss anything? - You're just in time.	6	2
How many funerals have you been to today?	6	2
- Excuse me? - He wants to know where you got the drink.	6	2
Give my regards to Megan.	6	2
Rumor has it they're gonna move her to four days a week.	6	2
Legend has it.	6	2
So, is she alive?	6	2
Yes, she is.	6	2
Don, what about your mother? Still with us?	6	2
I'm gonna watch from over there.	6	2
If I could get your attention.	6	2
I'd like to thank everyone for coming.	6	2
I apologize for the dry atmosphere...	6	2
but as I've been reminded many times today...	6	2
Mother did not approve of libations.	6	2
Excuse me, but I have a few words to say.	6	2
- I insist. - [Doorbell Rings]	6	2
Of course. Why don't you roll on over here?	6	2
Can everyone forget what I've said so far...	6	2
so that Mrs. Hazel Tinsley, who graciously flew up from Palm Beach...	6	2
can have the honor of going first?	6	2
Stay here.	6	2
I want to say something, if I may...	6	2
at this informal moment...	6	2
because I do not believe in speaking graveside.	6	2
This is where she lived, and this is where she died.	6	2
"""This woman spent 90 years on the Earth..."""	6	2
"""of noble birth and of some advantage..."""	6	2
"""devoting herself to one man, but loving another."""	6	2
"""That man was Roger."" That's you."	6	2
"""When Roger Sterling Sr.'s brief time was over..."""	6	2
"""it was this Roger who filled her days."""	6	2
"""One could not talk to her without hearing about his achievements..."""	6	2
"""his wit, his kindness."""	6	2
"We all said, ""Mimsy."""	6	2
"""Mims, you should find another man. Life is long."""	6	2
"She said, ""I don't need anyone."""	6	2
"""My heart is full because my son is my sunshine.'"""	6	2
[Gags]	6	2
[Gasping]	6	2
Get him out of here.	6	2
Sorry. I'm sorry.	6	2
Where were you?	6	2
I'm sorry, but is that man all right?	6	2
- What's he doing here? - What?	6	2
- You heard me. - Can we get someone in here to clean up?	6	2
- Let Bruce Pike clean it up. - Roger.	6	2
I just wanted to pay my respects.	6	2
I think it would have been more respectful of you not to come.	6	2
- She didn't like you either. - I don't think I ever met your mother.	6	2
She wouldn't if she had. This is supposed to be just family.	6	2
- See how upset everybody is? - Roger, stop. Stop it this minute.	6	2
- You shouldn't have brought him. - Daddy, please.	6	2
This is my funeral!	6	2
You know what? Party's over. Everybody out.	6	2
Thank you very much. Out!	6	2
[Door Closes]	6	2
[Car Horn Honking]	6	2
Thank you.	6	2
Pardon me. I'm looking for someone. Could you help me?	6	2
Everybody's gone.	6	2
Not everybody, obviously.	6	2
I think they were overwhelmed by that touching tribute.	6	2
What do you want?	6	2
That man never tires of embarrassing himself.	6	2
You're the one who brought him.	6	2
I'm talking about Don.	6	2
Oh. He was just saying what everybody else was thinking.	6	2
You shouldn't have brought him.	6	2
You're right.	6	2
Now you have one on me. Do you feel better?	6	2
My mother's dead.	6	2
I know, Roger.	6	2
Must be very hard for you.	6	2
I don't feel anything.	6	2
You certainly seem emotional.	6	2
Because I need a drink.	6	2
She lived a long time.	6	2
And she knew that you loved her.	6	2
So maybe there's nothing to drink about.	6	2
I feel like she always wanted to spend time with me and I never did.	6	2
That may be something to consider.	6	2
You have a family.	6	2
[Scoffs] Are you kidding me? I looked out at that crowd...	6	2
and all I saw was a bunch more women I've disappointed.	6	2
Roger Sterling, no matter what you do, everyone loves you.	6	2
What you're seeing is them worried about how you feel about them.	6	2
So, you miss me?	6	2
I know your daughter does.	6	2
Don't you wonder what Margaret will say at your funeral?	6	2
You had to bring that up.	6	2
I did.	6	2
You should spend more time with her.	6	2
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	6	2
Remember the last time this bed was covered in furs?	6	2
We rolled around all over them.	6	2
- What are you doing? - I don't know.	6	2
You look great.	6	2
It would be soothing.	6	2
Soothe yourself.	6	2
I'm gonna clean up.	6	2
[Door Closes]	6	2
[Sighs]	6	2
Jonesy.	6	2
Mr. Draper, are you all right?	6	2
- He's not feeling well. - Hey, Jonesy.	6	2
Jonesy, what did you see?	6	2
I didn't see nothing, Mr. Draper.	6	2
No, no, when you died, what did you see?	6	2
- Don, let's get you upstairs. - Wait, I want to know. I want to know.	6	2
What did you see when you died?	6	2
I don't know. Doc said I wasn't really dead.	6	2
I saw it. You were dead. He died right there.	6	2
What did you see?	6	2
I don't like to think about it.	6	2
- You must have seen something. - I guess there was a light.	6	2
- Was it like hot, tropical sunshine? - I don't know.	6	2
- Did you hear the ocean? - Mr. Draper, you should go upstairs.	6	2
- Is he all right? - He'll be fine.	6	2
- Excuse me. - Yeah?	6	2
- Is that St. Mark's Place? - Yup.	6	2
I'm sorry, I'm looking for someone. A girl.	6	2
- Which one? - This one.	6	2
There's lots of chicks that come in and out of here.	6	2
I've been in the buildings across the street. Are you sure you haven't seen her?	6	2
Look, lady, it's cold as a witch's tit. We're going inside.	6	2
May I?	6	2
Door's always open, man.	6	2

Sandy?	6	2
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.	6	2
I'm sorry to bother you again...	6	2
but this violin, this belongs to the girl I was talking about.	6	2
Are you sure you haven't seen her?	6	2
Look, lady, I don't want to have to lay the regular rap on you...	6	2
but I am exhausted from telling people like you I haven't seen people like her.	6	2
- But she was here. - I haven't seen your daughter.	6	2
She's not my daughter.	6	2
So, what are you, some kind of social worker?	6	2

Shit. What's her name?	6	2
Sandy.	6	2
Hey, anybody seen Sandy?	6	2
Do you know how to make goulash?	6	2
'Cause I've got pork butt, two onions, and lentils...	6	2
which I think is what's in it.	6	2
Hey, Moon, turn around.	6	2
And paprika. I know that's in it. [Chuckles]	6	2
Well, for one thing, you'll need a pot.	6	2
We got a pot.	6	2
You'll have to wash it out.	6	2
There's no water.	6	2
Really?	6	2
We used to use the hose at the Episcopal church...	6	2
but now the pipes are frozen.	6	2
It was great here all summer. It was hot.	6	2
So much rather be hot than cold.	6	2
I'll go on the roof and get a chunk of snow.	6	2
Oh, you'll get sick.	6	2
We do it all the time.	6	2
My mom makes great goulash.	6	2
- Where are you from? - Everywhere.	6	2
Hold on.	6	2
I think there's an army knife by the bed.	6	2
[Roger] Hello?	6	2
Your mother still here?	6	2
No. She left.	6	2
I'm just waiting for them to wrap up the deli.	6	2
Where's Skeezix?	6	2
Brooks took him bike riding.	6	2
It's kind of cold out there.	6	2
He can't tell the difference.	6	2
The other day he walked in singing...	6	2
and I looked and his nose was bleeding.	6	2
He didn't know how he did it.	6	2
So he's tough.	6	2
Listen, I want you to have something.	6	2
This was your grandmother's.	6	2
My dad brought it back for her.	6	2
He went everywhere.	6	2
- What is it? - It's water from the River Jordan.	6	2
I was baptized with it. So were you.	6	2
We would have used it on Ellery, but I guess she forgot.	6	2
Hope she didn't put her teeth in it.	6	2
[Laughs] Well, thank you. It's lovely.	6	2
Did Nana Mimsy leave me anything else?	6	2
I'm afraid she left everything to the zoo.	6	2
She's making them name the animals.	6	2
I'm sorry.	6	2
That doesn't seem funny to me.	6	2
It does to me.	6	2
Her will looked like the manifest from Noah's ark. [Laughs]	6	2
Well, it's different for you.	6	2
Brooks didn't start off where you did.	6	2
- He'll get there. - Oh, I know he will.	6	2
It's just that there's...	6	2
Well, Daddy, there's this opportunity.	6	2
I don't know, I...	6	2
I told Nana about it, but obviously she didn't understand.	6	2
Were you this specific?	6	2
Daddy, don't. It's not good for you.	6	2
I worry.	6	2
Refrigeration.	6	2
It's the wave of the future, Daddy.	6	2
They can transport fruit all the way from California...	6	2
in just four days and it doesn't go bad.	6	2
Some of these trucks can carry 20 tons.	6	2
And, of course, you're buying the technology...	6	2
for the refrigerated trucks, so it doesn't matter what they get used for.	6	2
It's really not Brooks' problem.	6	2
Well, I guess you should have Brooks talk to me about it.	6	2
Of course.	6	2
I know he'd like to make it on his own, but...	6	2
I'd have to see something on paper.	6	2
Oh, he's got that, believe me.	6	2
Well, good.	6	2
And I'm glad we had this little chat.	6	2
Oh, Daddy.	6	2
I'm going to go see if they're done in the kitchen.	6	2
[Megan] Don?	6	2
Don?	6	2
Did you make it to the memorial?	6	2
Except for the mess, you're exactly where I left you.	6	2
I put in an appearance. I should have had lunch.	6	2
Aspirin?	6	2
I'm better now. You?	6	2
Well, I pushed Derek's mother down the stairs.	6	2
- Did you? - I did.	6	2
They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes...	6	2
but I don't know how close the camera was...	6	2
because it was a stuntman in a dress.	6	2
Don't worry. I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.	6	2
I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.	6	2
Yes, they will.	6	2
So you'll still love me even if I'm a lying, cheating whore?	6	2
But I'm gonna walk behind you on the stairs.	6	2
[Laughs]	6	2
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make you dinner.	6	2
Oh, Rosa found this in the garbage.	6	2
I think she was afraid you'd think she was stealing.	6	2
Sleep. I'll come get you.	6	2
[Door Closes]	6	2
[Moon] Hey, Danny, where'd you take that joint?	6	2
There's three fucking rooms. Where do you think I am?	6	2
No, thank you.	6	2
- Is marijuana expensive? - Do I have to stir it again?	6	2
- Is it boiling? - No.	6	2
- My coat smells like onions. - Man: Yoo-hoo.	6	2
You better tell him you did the cooking, man. It's your job.	6	2
It's my bag.	6	2
- It smells good. - I made goulash.	6	2
- Did you get Wonder Bread? - We got batteries.	6	2
Hey, Zal, did you make any friends today?	6	2
Did you run into this chick? What's her name?	6	2
I'm sorry. This violin belongs to my friend Sandy. Do you know when she'll be back?	6	2
Sorry, Blondie, but that violin belongs to me.	6	2
No, I know the girl who plays this violin and I'm looking for her.	6	2
Yeah, no, I saw her. She sold it to me.	6	2
She's trying to get enough bread to go to California. Says it's too cold.	6	2
So where is she now?	6	2
- Does she owe you money? - No.	6	2
Well, your daughter's long gone, Blondie, so why don't you run along?	6	2
- Come on, Zal. - Why are you being so rude?	6	2
Why can't you leave her be? Kills you to be out of control.	6	2
Well, someone needs to control this mess.	6	2
Lady, we have to take everything the Establishment throws away. That's all that's left.	6	2
What you can't grok is that we are your garbage.	6	2
You don't want this house, you don't want us.	6	2
You're not allowed to ask anybody to leave.	6	2
The bylaws say if someone is a nuisance or a narc, that shall not be observed.	6	2
I'm obviously not the people you're talking about.	6	2
I came here because I'm looking for someone that I do want.	6	2
I did not throw her away.	6	2
Yeah, you're a goody. I can tell.	6	2
Look at this. She's got 80 bucks.	6	2
- Can I have it? - No. That's all they care about.	6	2
Well, Miss Elizabeth Hofstadt Francis of Rye, New York...	6	2
eyes blue, hair bottled...	6	2
we don't like your life any more than you do.	6	2
You have bad manners.	6	2
You deserve to live in the street of this pigsty...	6	2
and I hope you get tetanus or crabs or whatever else is crawling around here.	6	2
Hey, that's my violin.	6	2
She sold it? I don't believe you.	6	2
You want it? I'll give it to you for 10.	6	2
- What are you going to do with a violin? - Gonna learn how to play it.	6	2
Because it's so easy.	6	2
[Fabric Rips]	6	2
[Door Opens]	6	2
[Door Closes]	6	2
[Typing]	6	2
There's a meatball, which is probably cold by now...	6	2
and an Italian, which is probably even colder.	6	2
You're typing a lot. You got a new way to go?	6	2
No, I'm doing this thing Don used to do.	6	2
I'm writing a letter to a fictitious acquaintance...	6	2
telling her how great my new headphones are.	6	2
Well, I hate that it gives you extra work...	6	2
but I think it's about time...	6	2
this unjust war is finally having an impact on commerce.	6	2
Meatball.	6	2
- Did we order dinner? - No.	6	2
- Oh. - I can share.	6	2
Try the headphones again. Try and think of some words.	6	2
- What have you got? - We have three very different angles.	6	2
If you dip the audio in the wide shot...	6	2
Mark Antony is just, you know...	6	2
"mouthing the ""lend me your ears"" part."	6	2
You hear the announcer say one of these things...	6	2
"One: ""Are you ready for the sound for the ages?"""	6	2
"Two: ""Koss knows that good sound is timeless."""	6	2
"Or ""Ladies and gentlemen..."""	6	2
"""this is not your old-fashioned sound."""	6	2
What's the next one?	6	2
- The next one or the second one? - You said you had three.	6	2
Those were three. Didn't I read all of them?	6	2
Those are three different versions of the same idea.	6	2
If you can't tell the difference between which part's the idea...	6	2
and which part's the execution of the idea, you're of no use to me.	6	2
I know what you're doing. I've been you.	6	2
You're hoping this sparks my imagination...	6	2
"and then you can say, ""Wow, she's a genius..."""	6	2
or say anything because you want to go home.	6	2
I think they're very different from each other.	6	2
Well, I'm sorry to point it out, but you're walking over the same ground.	6	2
When you bring me something like this, it looks like cowardice.	6	2
Here, you can split this 'cause you're not going home.	6	2
What do you think?	6	2
What?	6	2
- How do they sound? - Scared. You were a little rough.	6	2
No, the headphones. Don't worry about them.	6	2
Some workers don't respond to that.	6	2
Look, Abe, I don't need another negative voice.	6	2
"And those, quote, ""workers"" aren't surprised that I'm frustrated..."	6	2
because they know that they're lazy.	6	2
Sorry. I didn't know what kind of abuse was required to get into the frat.	6	2
Listen to your music, kid.	6	2
Because you laughed at him.	6	2
Yes, they like that.	6	2
Hello.	6	2
[Mouths]	6	2
Where you been?	6	2
I had some errands to run.	6	2
Well, I know what somebody's getting next Christmas.	6	2
Did you eat?	6	2
Chicken salad.	6	2
That's a relief, because my feet are frozen.	6	2
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	6	2
Morning. How are we today?	6	2
- Fine, thank you. - You're welcome.	6	2
Seeing as how you were under the weather...	6	2
I just wanted to remind you about Jules and Terry from Sheraton later.	6	2
Cancel.	6	2
Their bosses are coming back next week...	6	2
and they just sent you on a very expensive trip.	6	2
Would you get Stan in here?	6	2
Oh, listen.	6	2
I got this by mistake. It belongs to some private.	6	2
See if you can find out some way to get it to his division.	6	2
I will. Do you want to enclose a note?	6	2
Nah. I found it on a barstool.	6	2
I mean, you've got to be on my side here, right?	6	2
First my ex-wife works the body with a brutal guilt attack...	6	2
and then my daughter works the wallet like a speed bag.	6	2
[Doctor] You want me on your side?	6	2
- You have kids? - We're not talking about me.	6	2
You know, I used to jump off mountains.	6	2
It never occurred to me I had this invisible parachute.	6	2
My mother loved me in some completely pointless way and it's gone.	6	2
So there it is. She gave me my last new experience.	6	2
And now I know that all I'm going to be doing...	6	2
from here on is losing everything.	6	2
You feel loss.	6	2
Damn it, how many times do I have to say this? I don't feel anything.	6	2
I'm just acknowledging that life, unlike this analysis...	6	2
will eventually end and somebody else will get the bill.	6	2
- Good morning, Ken. - Good morning, Bob.	6	2
What are you doing out here?	6	2
You have a meeting with someone important?	6	2
[Laughs] No, but are you looking for me?	6	2
I'll drop everything. I just came out here to enjoy the light.	6	2
Oh, I thought maybe you were out here greeting customers for your catering business.	6	2
What are you talking about?	6	2
You know exactly.	6	2
I'm sorry, are you cross with me?	6	2
Someone sent a royal spread to Sterling's.	6	2
It had a card on it with your name.	6	2
Oh, that. It just seemed the thing to do.	6	2
Well, it was too much.	6	2
It was almost like you were invited, but you weren't.	6	2
I guess I was just remembering when my father died.	6	2
Any gesture meant something to me.	6	2
There wasn't supposed to be a card.	6	2
Okay. Well, take your work and go back to your office.	6	2
Sitting out here makes people think you have nothing to do...	6	2
and I suspect you're hoping it's the opposite.	6	2
I guess it's time to catch up on my phone calls.	6	2
Look, we're sorry we had to squeeze in this meeting between the holidays.	6	2
We're obviously not expecting a full presentation.	6	2
Well, I can say with all honesty...	6	2
that Don has not stopped talking about your incredible property.	6	2
I never stayed at the Royal, but I shipped out of Pearl in 1943...	6	2
and, I've got to say, I can still smell the gardenias.	6	2
Thank you for that. Don?	6	2
So, Bob Grange and his delightful wife Patty...	6	2
saw to our every need and also missed no opportunity...	6	2
to expose us to the unique local flavor.	6	2
Lucky Bob. I tried to get that job...	6	2
but unfortunately I got promoted.	6	2
[All Laughing]	6	2
Well, I've just come back...	6	2
and I'm not sure how much I've talked about it...	6	2
but there is a feeling that's stayed with me.	6	2
I've been in the winter.	6	2
It's quite a shock coming back.	6	2
Well put. But that could be any vacation.	6	2
This was very, very different.	6	2
I think we're not selling a geographical location. We're selling an experience.	6	2
It's not just a different place, you are different.	6	2
And you'd think there'd be an unsettling feeling...	6	2
about something so drastically different, but there's something else.	6	2
You don't miss anything. You're not homesick.	6	2
It puts you in this state.	6	2
The air and the water are all the same temperature as your body.	6	2
It's sensory... the music, the fragrance...	6	2
the breeze, and the blue. Stan.	6	2
[Clears Throat]	6	2
It's just a sketch.	6	2
[Don] Hawaiian legend has it that the soul...	6	2
can go in and out of the body...	6	2
but that it usually leaves from a leeward point into the waves.	6	2
"""Hawaii. The jumping off point."""	6	2
So what happened to him?	6	2
He got off the plane, took a deep breath...	6	2
shed his skin, and jumped off.	6	2
I assume this is a photograph.	6	2
Four-color. That water is transparent.	6	2
Well, I suppose it reminds me a little of the cinema.	6	2
But mostly I see James Mason at the end of that movie walking into the sea.	6	2
What is that movie?	6	2
I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.	6	2
He's killing himself. I don't think they show it...	6	2
but he's going to swim out until he can't swim back.	6	2
That may be a personal association for you...	6	2
but that's not what this means.	6	2
We looked at this. None of us thought of that.	6	2
A Star is Born.	6	2
The copy is all about the Hawaiian legend.	6	2
Aloha means hello and good-bye.	6	2
I'm sorry, but this is very poetic.	6	2
- Thank you. - Where's our hotel?	6	2
Where's the Pink Palace and Diamond Head?	6	2
You got to have Diamond Head in the shot.	6	2
Anyone can do that.	6	2
I don't agree.	6	2
Well, there's no reason we can't tilt the camera up 45 degrees...	6	2
and see the husk of our city dweller on the sand...	6	2
and an arm of the hotel and Diamond Head in the background.	6	2
So there would be a man in this photo...	6	2
and he most likely would be naked?	6	2
Actually, my first thought is there is no man.	6	2
Just his footprints. What happened to him?	6	2
I think, and I think people might think, that he died.	6	2
Maybe he did and he went to heaven.	6	2
Maybe that's what this feels like.	6	2
- It's a little morbid. - Well, heaven's a little morbid.	6	2
How do you get to heaven? Something terrible has to happen.	6	2
We don't want that in the ad.	6	2
[Chuckles] Of course there's no doubt this concept itself...	6	2
is merely a jumping off point.	6	2
A picture of a hotel, even yours, is easy to ignore.	6	2
This, or some version of this, demands your attention.	6	2
Well, you will continue to have our attention.	6	2
Make no mistake, we're not afraid of provocative.	6	2
So is there any time left for holiday plans for either of you?	6	2
- Happy New Year, everyone. - You as well.	6	2
What's the matter?	6	2
You didn't get all your vomiting done at my mother's funeral?	6	2
Roger, I apologize. I had a bug.	6	2
Yeah, well, you didn't miss anything.	6	2
Does that make you think of suicide?	6	2
Of course. That's what's so great about it.	6	2
You know, we sold actual death...	6	2
for 25 years with Lucky Strike.	6	2
You know how we did it? We ignored it.	6	2
Hold on.	6	2
Can I go to Becky's for New Year's Eve?	6	2
- Talk to your mother. - Can't you get a sitter?	6	2
Have your friend come here. You can bang pots and pans at midnight.	6	2
It's a party. They can't bring the whole party here.	6	2
I'll stay until 9:00. I'll put them to bed.	6	2
- [Door Closes] - [Betty] Hello.	6	2
Ask your mother. We're in here.	6	2
So?	6	2
Anything new?	6	2
I hate it. You're ugly.	6	2
What happened to you?	6	2
So?	6	2
Elizabeth Taylor...	6	2
what have you done with my wife?	6	2
[Laughs]	6	2
You're free until lunch, but I have to tell you something.	6	2
Just a minute. What's that?	6	2
More bad news. Giorgio died.	6	2
His family sent over his shoeshine kit...	6	2
because you were the only one who called about him.	6	2
- What happened to him? - I didn't ask.	6	2
[Sobbing]	6	2
So the secret is to rub the pot with a clove of garlic...	6	2
and then add twice the kirschwasser.	6	2
How wonderful that we can just stagger downstairs.	6	2
I might just get undressed in the elevator.	6	2
I don't know if I can make it to midnight...	6	2
but I do know we're not leaving here until those kids are in bed.	6	2
It's a beautiful fondue pot. Where'd you get it?	6	2
Bloomingdale's.	6	2
The kitchen store. They have everything you could think of.	6	2
Not everything. Tell the story.	6	2
Well, there's a guy in my office.	6	2
He's very flamboyant and he got arrested there.	6	2
- Shoplifting? - No.	6	2
But he was caught red-handed.	6	2
- [Laughs] - Apparently the men's room...	6	2
is a locale for a certain kind of assignation...	6	2
and the store detective's always going in there and looking under the stall.	6	2
So, my regional sales manager...	6	2
apparently takes two shopping bags, puts his feet in them...	6	2
while the love of his life sat on the john.	6	2
That is clever.	6	2
How the hell did he get caught?	6	2
How old are your children?	6	2
Um, 11 and seven.	6	2
Well, I might go kiss them good night.	6	2
Ours is a freshman at Michigan.	6	2
- He didn't even come home. - Oh, I'm not ready for that.	6	2
The house feels empty. Then you get a phone bill.	6	2
[Laughter]	6	2
Well, if everybody's had enough cheese...	6	2
I'm gonna switch to chocolate.	6	2
But first, because it looks like it's snowing...	6	2
I think it's time we all took a trip to Hawaii.	6	2
[Sighs] We're having such a good time.	6	2
It's all set up.	6	2
I want to go to Hawaii.	6	2
[Chuckles]	6	2
- Oh! - Ooh.	6	2
- Isn't it incredible? - Yeah.	6	2
[Light Laughter]	6	2
[Megan] Oh, let me explain.	6	2
I woke up in the morning and Don was at a wedding giving away the bride.	6	2
That's romantic.	6	2
How did that happen?	6	2
So, of course, Kreutzer's yelling...	6	2
"and Ginsberg says, ""I'm sorry, but what the hell do I know about ham?"""	6	2
[Laughs]	6	2
How could they let him near clients? Haven't they learned?	6	2
Hey, do you think Joan and Roger are still sleeping together?	6	2
Because his mother croaked and she completely ignored him.	6	2
I don't know. We don't even know if that really ever happened.	6	2
I've got pictures in my head.	6	2
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.	6	2
- You want some? - Very funny.	6	2
Hey, I'm not hanging up.	6	2
[Ted] Happy New Year.	6	2
Ted. What are you doing here?	6	2
I heard there were four people in the office on New Year's Eve.	6	2
I figured I owed it to the team to at least stop by.	6	2
Oh, I'm just...	6	2
There's a... Did you get my message?	6	2
I received them all. And I apologize...	6	2
but it was sort of a retreat for my wife and I...	6	2
and, well, apparently I work too much.	6	2
Well, you know the problem.	6	2
Yes. Any solutions?	6	2
There's one.	6	2
I found this thing.	6	2
- What is this? - It's an outtake.	6	2
He had his headset on and was clowning around.	6	2
There's two minutes of it.	6	2
Look at this guy. What a pain in the ass.	6	2
I was irritated about it on the day...	6	2
but now I'm a little excited.	6	2
I think you can show him making these faces...	6	2
with no music, and say something like...	6	2
"""Koss Headphones... sound so sharp and clear, you can actually see it."""	6	2
It always takes a crisis to sell work this good.	6	2
You think it's good?	6	2
Makes me smile more than the original.	6	2
- Do you want to see the new voice-over? - No.	6	2
Well, I hope I didn't ruin your evening.	6	2
Not mine, but there's people working out there, Peggy. It's New Year's Eve.	6	2
If you knew you had something, you should have let them go.	6	2
- They know they can go. - No, they don't.	6	2
Oh.	6	2
You're good in a crisis.	6	2
Thank you.	6	2
Happy New Year.	6	2
[Stan] He likes you.	6	2
- [Chuckles] - What did you hear?	6	2
All of it.	6	2
[Stan Chuckles]	6	2
This is Galliano.	6	2
It's from Jonesy.	6	2
I'm glad he's giving presents to someone else.	6	2
I can't stand the constant boot-licking.	6	2
He's grateful.	6	2
- Cent'anni. - What does that mean?	6	2
It's Italian for l'chaim.	6	2
"It means ""100 years."""	6	2
What do you think Dave paid for their place?	6	2
Arnold, don't.	6	2
Fine. Don, what did you pay?	6	2
75.	6	2
Well, you're a floor higher than us.	6	2
Jesus. Syl, did you hear that?	6	2
Happy New Year.	6	2
- [Megan Laughs] - [Phone Ringing]	6	2
- We missed midnight. It's 1:00. - [Rings]	6	2
We missed it.	6	2
- [Rings] - It's probably my mother.	6	2
Or Dave and Cathy.	6	2
- Face down in the hall. - [Laughs]	6	2
Hello?	6	2
Um, Arnie, it's the service.	6	2
Thank you.	6	2
Hello?	6	2
Okay.	6	2
All right, tell them I'm on my way.	6	2
I've got to go.	6	2
[Kiss]	6	2
I need cigarettes. I'll walk you down.	6	2
It's 1:00 a.m. in a snowstorm on a holiday on a Sunday.	6	2
You are never gonna get a cab.	6	2
Don't even try to talk him out of it.	6	2
- These them? - Yeah, you see the boots?	6	2
What is it like to have someone's life in your hands?	6	2
Well, it's a privilege and an honor...	6	2
to be trusted with that responsibility.	6	2
There they are.	6	2
Look at that.	6	2
Time to quit smoking.	6	2
It's a good resolution.	6	2
Well...	6	2
that's one lucky patient.	6	2
Honestly, Don, the whole life-and-death thing...	6	2
it doesn't bother me. It never has.	6	2
Guys like us, that's why we get paid.	6	2
- Us? - Fine.	6	2
You get paid to think about things they don't want to think about...	6	2
and I get paid to not think about them.	6	2
People will do anything to alleviate their anxiety.	6	2
[Taps Softly]	6	2
Did you read my Dante?	6	2
It made me think of you.	6	2
I don't know how to take that.	6	2
It's beautiful.	6	2
What do you want for this year?	6	2
I want to stop doing this.	6	2
I know.	6	2

Previously on Mad Men...	6	3
Heinz beans. Some things never change.	6	3
Oh, it's clever.	6	3
We're going to lose Jaguar unless	6	3
an arrangement is made, and	6	3
it involves you and her.	6	3
You look radiant, Joan.	6	3
You must have heard some terrible things about me from Don Draper.	6	3
Now, why would you want to play for the other team?	6	3
It's not a game.	6	3
You don't get another chance at what you have.	6	3
 I have it all.	6	3
Here we go.	6	3
The one with the fur.	6	3
You know, I might just take you up on those theater tickets.	6	3
"- You must see ""Hair."" - Oh, you like that?"	6	3
- Who doesn't? - What is it?	6	3
Oh, it's just filled with profanity,	6	3
marijuana smoking, and simulated sexual acts.	6	3
Simulated?	6	3
And a few songs.	6	3
The two holiday chairmanships that remain	6	3
are the 4th of July block party,	6	3
which really consists of calling the fire department,	6	3
or the Labor Day Soap Box Derby,	6	3
 which consists of calling the hospital.	6	3
Which one do you do?	6	3
Our family has claimed the Easter egg hunt.	6	3
Do you dress as a bunny?	6	3
Maybe a little cottontail?	6	3
It's very wholesome.	6	3
Mm-hmm.	6	3
I'd like to surprise Doug for his birthday.	6	3
Maybe you could get me the tickets in secret.	6	3
Arrangements could be made.	6	3
Just pick a date and ring me up.	6	3
I have to warn you, I'm from a small town	6	3
and all of my forays into Manhattan have been a disaster.	6	3
We'll make a deal.	6	3
Brave your way to Grand Central	6	3
and I'll hand off the tickets and throw in a hot dog.	6	3
You have another one of those?	6	3
"But you've already seen ""Hair."""	6	3
Maybe I want to see it again.	6	3
Oh, there you are.	6	3
Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure.	6	3
Thank you both for your hospitality.	6	3
- Thank you again. - It was lovely.	6	3
Consider what I said about the pool.	6	3
That is the end of the welcome wagon.	6	3
We'll basically have to move to get someone to make dinner for us.	6	3
What was that about the pool?	6	3
He's insistent we all go skinny-dipping.	6	3
Ha! Let him get his own pool.	6	3
Turn it off.	6	3
I need to put it in the mail today and the tailor.	6	3
Sylvia, sweetheart--	6	3
- Good morning. - Morning.	6	3
Morning.	6	3
- Honey. - Oh, I'm sorry.	6	3
I'll swing by the bank at lunch.	6	3
I give her cash every month,	6	3
but I think she's secretly sending it all to our kid.	6	3
You don't have to explain anything.	6	3
You're lucky your wife works.	6	3
She doesn't earn much.	6	3
Not yet.	6	3
I forgot my cigarettes.	6	3
You got to stop that nonsense.	6	3
Listen, don't worry about dinner Wednesday. We'll have money by then.	6	3
Looking forward to it.	6	3
I knew it'd be you.	6	3
"""I've Got Five Dollars"" playing in background"	6	3
It wasn't all bad. I got me some memories.	6	3
And the boy.	6	3
Don't know what it is yet.	6	3
I mean Dick here.	6	3
Well, hello there.	6	3
This is Mack. He's with me, so he's your uncle.	6	3
We thank the Lord for opening your rooms to us.	6	3
"All I said was, ""My sister's coming with her boy."""	6	3
Mack's the one that brung ya.	6	3
I'd do the same for mine.	6	3
And, of course, Ernestine told you	6	3
we could always use a little help around here.	6	3
Let's get you off your feet.	6	3
Dick, you help Mack with the bags.	6	3
You keep your eyes down and mind your own business here.	6	3
Good-looking kid. He yours?	6	3
Not that I know.	6	3
Little boy, find your own sins.	6	3
Stay away from Mack's.	6	3
Afternoon, Charlotte.	6	3
Hey, kid, you were raised on a farm, am I right?	6	3
Yes, sir.	6	3
Well, I'm the rooster around here, understand?	6	3
You help all the hens?	6	3
And I'll bring on the day.	6	3
I feel bad.	6	3
You should. I have to go to work.	6	3
You get to sleep.	6	3
No, about dinner.	6	3
I thought there was no smoking.	6	3
I just found out the maid smokes.	6	3
She doesn't sleep in here, does she?	6	3
You don't mind sitting across the table	6	3
from your wife and my husband?	6	3
I don't think about it.	6	3
They're both good company.	6	3
They are.	6	3
I suppose that has nothing to do with this.	6	3
This didn't happen.	6	3
Just in here.	6	3
You're right.	6	3
I only said yes because Arnold wants to impress you.	6	3
I only said yes because Megan keeps asking.	6	3
- She likes you. - And I like her.	6	3
It's 9:00. I have to go.	6	3
You love to go.	6	3
Well, it's nice to know that no matter what	6	3
we got something done today.	6	3
You found it in the cookie jar.	6	3
I have money, I just never have money.	6	3
Mr. Mathis and Mr. Gifford are waiting outside.	6	3
Why didn't you tell me?	6	3
Because they don't want to come in.	6	3
Look, Phyllis, I've had their job.	6	3
I know. And you've had my job, too.	6	3
So you know it wouldn't hurt if you were to act like--	6	3
if you were as encouraging to them as you are to me.	6	3
Why don't you just get me whatever book you read	6	3
and save me these little lectures?	6	3
More coffee?	6	3
She's ready for you.	6	3
Have a seat.	6	3
- No, don't. - What's wrong with them?	6	3
The strategy is Clearasil stops blemishes	6	3
that keep you from having fun.	6	3
That means no one should be having fun.	6	3
Okay.	6	3
So we'll just start over.	6	3
Just a minute.	6	3
I don't want you to think that just because	6	3
I have high standards	6	3
that means I'm not happy with you.	6	3
Especially, you know, the way you are.	6	3
The way you are has nothing to do	6	3
with the fact that the work needs work.	6	3
Thank you, Coach. We'll try our best.	6	3
There you go.	6	3
Please, dear, don't linger in the hallway.	6	3
Your coat?	6	3
Can I get you something to eat?	6	3
I think I have some peanuts and some cheese crackers.	6	3
No, thank you.	6	3
Perhaps something to drink?	6	3
I have bourbon, vodka,	6	3
gin, champagne.	6	3
I shouldn't. I started on the train.	6	3
What kind of music do you like?	6	3
None for me.	6	3
Is the temperature okay?	6	3
Yes.	6	3
Hmm.	6	3
It's been known to get hot.	6	3
I'm fine.	6	3
That's a pretty shade of lipstick.	6	3
Thank you.	6	3
I'm glad you came.	6	3
Come with me.	6	3
DDB managed to get me on the 50-yard line	6	3
for the Giants game last November.	6	3
If we'd done it, the Steelers would have won.	6	3
We'd do anything to make you happy.	6	3
I'm not unhappy with DDB.	6	3
No notes.	6	3
When I presented the numbers for my division,	6	3
"Timmy came up to me and said, ""How the hell did you do that?"""	6	3
So I figured he's in town,	6	3
why not take him to the horse's mouth?	6	3
The past few years,	6	3
I've overseen ketchup to great success.	6	3
But how long before we're old news?	6	3
And, hell, when I saw baked beans have a sales spike like that...	6	3
Raymond has demanded our best work.	6	3
So then the question is what can we do for you?	6	3
What can we do for ketchup?	6	3
Let me know.	6	3
A pleasure to meet you, Timmy.	6	3
This isn't an official visit.	6	3
I'm just dropping by.	6	3
Ken, Don and I have a little beans housekeeping, if you don't mind.	6	3
I'd love to walk you out.	6	3
Raymond, we're grateful for this opportunity	6	3
and consider it quite a vote of confidence.	6	3
It is, but I don't want you to waste your time.	6	3
Well, then if nothing else, we appreciate the introduction.	6	3
I'm not winking here.	6	3
There is to be no further communication	6	3
with Timmy or his division.	6	3
I'm sorry, Raymond. Did we do something to upset you?	6	3
You guys are doing a bang-up job.	6	3
And now that polished Polack wants the same.	6	3
I'll take that drink.	6	3
No one's paid attention to me in nine years at the company.	6	3
They gave me a suicide mission.	6	3
Vinegar, sauces, and baked beans.	6	3
And then in my moment of triumph, he comes up to me	6	3
"and he didn't say, ""How did you do that?"""	6	3
"He said, ""How did you do that?"""	6	3
Smug bastard.	6	3
I taught him everything he knows.	6	3
- We understand, Raymond. - No, forget it.	6	3
I know ketchup's the gold standard,	6	3
but after all we've been through, I'm sure I don't need to tell you	6	3
that if you so much as send him a ham at Christmas,	6	3
well, I'd rather retire	6	3
than watch that guy screw my girlfriend.	6	3
- Let me walk you out. - No.	6	3
If he lingered at all,	6	3
I'm gonna pretend I'm on my way to the men's room.	6	3
I'm sorry. What a waste of time.	6	3
I don't know. We met Timmy.	6	3
- He's certainly going places. - Raymond's so weak.	6	3
But he brought his business here when we were barely standing.	6	3
It's Heinz Ketchup, Don.	6	3
It's the Coca-Cola of condiments.	6	3
I know.	6	3
But sometimes you've got to dance with the one that brung ya.	6	3
I'm afraid that's the end of your toilet paper.	6	3
This place could really use a woman's touch.	6	3
You think so?	6	3
I might come to town Friday.	6	3
There's always a sale at Macy's.	6	3
We'll see.	6	3
Okay, I'll call you.	6	3
If I let the phone ring once and hang up, then you'll know it's me.	6	3
Don't do that.	6	3
Well, I'm going to park my car	6	3
in front of the driveway instead of in the driveway.	6	3
Then you'll know I'm thinking of you.	6	3
That's sweet.	6	3
I really have to get back.	6	3
Can you move it along a little?	6	3
You told me you were washing these by hand.	6	3
- No wonder the elastic is shot. - I forgot.	6	3
And you forgot you left the vacuum on the terrace.	6	3
I was changing the bag.	6	3
And you forgot not to use S.O.S on the Teflon.	6	3
I mean, I leave for work every day	6	3
and I wonder what you're going to ruin in my house.	6	3
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Draper.	6	3
I don't know how to do this, but you're fired.	6	3
I'll get my things.	6	3
- I'm sorry. - No.	6	3
I am. I walked in on it and then I didn't want to pretend.	6	3
Are you okay, honey?	6	3
No.	6	3
Come on. Let's go upstairs.	6	3
I don't wanna go up until she's gone.	6	3
Let her alone with your silverware?	6	3
So, after weeks, I finally showed him the picture of my mother...	6	3
but that's not enough, because her name has been changed in the will.	6	3
That is quite a story line.	6	3
Well, you asked.	6	3
- It's meaty, isn't it? - It is.	6	3
I just wish watching TV during the day	6	3
didn't make me feel so guilty.	6	3
I had a miscarriage.	6	3
All right. I will watch.	6	3
No, in real life.	6	3
Two days ago.	6	3
I'm so sorry to hear that.	6	3
I'm sorry. I shouldn't burden you with this.	6	3
No, you obviously need to talk.	6	3
I was sloppy in Hawaii--	6	3
the time difference, vacation.	6	3
Now I feel so guilty.	6	3
May I?	6	3
What do you have to feel guilty about?	6	3
What did Don say?	6	3
I didn't tell him.	6	3
It's been a hard couple of weeks.	6	3
Oh.	6	3
I don't know why.	6	3
I mean, I do.	6	3
You were raised the same way I was.	6	3
I keep hearing Sister Eugenie in my head.	6	3
I'm such a horrible person.	6	3
You're not a horrible person.	6	3
No, I am.	6	3
I mean,	6	3
to be pregnant now	6	3
at this moment?	6	3
I didn't know what I wanted to do	6	3
and I was so relieved that I didn't have to do anything.	6	3
I see.	6	3
Has this ever happened to you?	6	3
About a year after I had Mitchell.	6	3
So I certainly understand some of what you're feeling.	6	3
But the rest of it,	6	3
no.	6	3
I'm sorry.	6	3
Really?	6	3
Because I was raised the same way,	6	3
so I would never even consider that my decision.	6	3
You really believe that?	6	3
I do.	6	3
And I think you do, too,	6	3
or you wouldn't feel this way.	6	3
I just feel so shitty.	6	3
I'm sorry I brought it up.	6	3
Hello.	6	3
Hello.	6	3
- Sylvia's here. - I see that.	6	3
Hello.	6	3
I should be going.	6	3
You don't have to rush off.	6	3
- Have a drink. - No, I'll leave you two alone.	6	3
- I fired the maid today. - Good riddance.	6	3
Good night, both of you.	6	3
See you tomorrow.	6	3
- Excuse me? - For dinner.	6	3
Oh, of course.	6	3
Yes.	6	3
So send her in.	6	3
Sorry to bother you, but this was on my desk.	6	3
Is it new?	6	3
There's usually a memo for everything around here.	6	3
- What is it? - It's Quest.	6	3
Feminine hygiene powder.	6	3
"- Did I miss a meeting? - ""Proof points--"	6	3
has baking soda, makes you nicer if you're stinky,	6	3
"kills overly critical bacteria."""	6	3
"""Target-- professional women and other Olsons."""	6	3
Just give it to me.	6	3
Calm down.	6	3
I think this is somebody's idea of a joke.	6	3
Of course, when you want them to be funny they're useless.	6	3
Hello, gorgeous.	6	3
Hello, Herb.	6	3
Did you get all gussied up for me?	6	3
No.	6	3
I had no idea you'd be darkening my doorway.	6	3
When are you gonna come out to the lot?	6	3
I told you, I'll let you have a Jaguar for as long as you like.	6	3
I take the bus.	6	3
I know there's a part of you that's glad to see me.	6	3
And I know there's a part of you you haven't seen in years.	6	3
Herb! There you are.	6	3
How are you today?	6	3
Toodle-oo.	6	3
Mrs. Harris is here to see you.	6	3
He's here.	6	3
Thank you.	6	3
- Who are you? - I'm Bob Benson.	6	3
We've met before. I'm part of the team.	6	3
Doesn't the elevator go up to this floor?	6	3
Herb.	6	3
What brings you by?	6	3
I had some thoughts, the complexity of which	6	3
could not be expressed over a telephone.	6	3
What is it you want?	6	3
Well, you guys are gonna make some fancy-schmancy	6	3
Michelangelo TV spot and the dealers	6	3
are gonna foot most of the bill for running it.	6	3
That's how it works.	6	3
Well, I'm the only guy actually out there selling hamburgers	6	3
and I want people to know there's a hamburger store in Englewood,	6	3
not England or in your mind.	6	3
I don't want another thing with some shmuck sitting on his lawn mower	6	3
fantasizing that he's gonna win the Grand Prix driving a Jaguar.	6	3
I need foot traffic.	6	3
Get 'em in the door so I can move metal.	6	3
Well, you, along with the factory guys,	6	3
have already signed off on the work as well as the buy.	6	3
I just think there should be retail radio as well.	6	3
"You know? ""Does your car sound like this?"""	6	3
"Voom voom! ""Does your wife sound like this?"""	6	3
"""Ooh, I love your car."""	6	3
And then you say the phone number twice.	6	3
Wonderful.	6	3
We'd love to increase the exposure of the campaign.	6	3
How much more would you like to buy?	6	3
There's no increase. Just adjust the proportions.	6	3
I think we should spend 60% of the money	6	3
on local dealership ads instead of national.	6	3
Herb, that would really take a bite out of the national campaign.	6	3
Well, if you say so.	6	3
Unfortunately, it's not up to me,	6	3
so I am suggesting	6	3
that you recommend this plan to all of us.	6	3
Why don't you recommend it? It's your idea.	6	3
Because it's an idea you had yourself.	6	3
And Lord knows you're so damn persuasive.	6	3
We understand, Herb.	6	3
See how easy that was, Bob?	6	3
Bob, why don't you show me the sights?	6	3
You must be like a kid in a candy store around here.	6	3
- You can't shake his hand? - He didn't seem interested.	6	3
In fact, the only thing he seemed interested in was gutting our national campaign.	6	3
You do realize that defeats the purpose of having Jaguar?	6	3
So he's demanding and unreasonable.	6	3
How does that make him different from the other people who walk through that door?	6	3
I wish you would handle the clients as well as you're handling me.	6	3
Jimmy's Condom Warehouse	6	3
where the rubber meets the road. Jimmy speaking.	6	3
You want a drink?	6	3
No, thank you. I'm quite comfortable.	6	3
How was your day, honey?	6	3
Okay.	6	3
Okay? What happened to Shangri-La?	6	3
Chaough quit crapping out snow cones?	6	3
Everyone hates me here.	6	3
Well, that was bound to happen.	6	3
You worked for me and you like me.	6	3
- I worked with you. - I was tough but fair.	6	3
Oh, speaking of people who hate you,	6	3
Raymond J. Beans came in today and pulled a real boner.	6	3
Go on.	6	3
He brought in the head of ketchup.	6	3
He's obsessed with that man.	6	3
Yeah, he should be. I met him.	6	3
So Raymond makes the introduction	6	3
and then, according to Ken, ketchup leaves, but Raymond lingers	6	3
and he says he's gonna kill the account and himself	6	3
if they even talk to ketchup again.	6	3
Why'd he bring him in?	6	3
Because he's Raymond. He's a fraidycat.	6	3
And-- here's the part that's gonna make you happy--	6	3
Kenny spent two weeks telling everybody	6	3
how he was getting ketchup.	6	3
Okay, Tuesday morning is perfect.	6	3
What? Oh, yep.	6	3
We'll have your wig ready then, ma'am.	6	3
You're allowed to make personal calls after 5:00,	6	3
especially if they make you laugh.	6	3
My friend Stan was telling me a funny story	6	3
- about one of our old clients. - What happened?	6	3
Oh, it's complicated, but basically the guy from Heinz Baked Beans	6	3
hates the guy at Heinz Ketchup.	6	3
Of course he does.	6	3
Well, surprisingly, beans brought ketchup in	6	3
for a meeting at the agency and everyone got excited,	6	3
and then unsurprisingly he sent ketchup out of the room	6	3
and told everyone it was just for show.	6	3
So he's unhappy?	6	3
He's not going anywhere.	6	3
Probably misses you.	6	3
No.	6	3
I assure you, he doesn't.	6	3
There's nothing like things going badly when you leave, is there?	6	3
Sorry I'm late.	6	3
3rd Avenue was a parking lot.	6	3
I'm not feeling well.	6	3
That's not where it hurts.	6	3
Oh. Did you cancel?	6	3
No, I thought I'd feel better by the time you got home.	6	3
We're supposed to be there in 15 minutes.	6	3
They're probably already there.	6	3
I know, but I don't want to pretend	6	3
like I'm having a good time and it's too late to cancel.	6	3
- They'll survive. - I want you to go.	6	3
I want you to have fun.	6	3
Okay.	6	3
But you go right to bed.	6	3
Yes, sir.	6	3
Go away!	6	3
Somebody help me!	6	3
What on earth is that?	6	3
Somebody, please!	6	3
Somebody help!	6	3
- Oh, my goodness! - What happened to you?	6	3
Hey, Campbell, she's your problem now.	6	3
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.	6	3
- He was chasing me. - Close the door.	6	3
Hold this to your nose.	6	3
What the hell happened?	6	3
I'm so embarrassed.	6	3
We had a terrible fight.	6	3
- I'm going to call the authorities. - No, please.	6	3
Well, then I'm taking you to the hospital.	6	3
- I'll be fine. - No, what do you think you're doing?	6	3
You're not going back there. Peter, go to Tammy's bathroom.	6	3
There's some cotton wool.	6	3
I'll be right back.	6	3
I hope you haven't been waiting long.	6	3
Oh, don't worry about it. I was late, too.	6	3
They already gave us a hard time.	6	3
- Where's your wife? - She sends her regrets. She wasn't feeling well.	6	3
- That's too bad. - You look lovely.	6	3
Let's get you a drink.	6	3
We'll get the waiter to do the whole show again.	6	3
I'm afraid there's only going to be three of us.	6	3
- Don? - Old-fashioned, please.	6	3
Subito.	6	3
Well, the North Koreans really took that ship.	6	3
And the Vietcong, did you see them storming the embassy?	6	3
I haven't followed it today.	6	3
- We got it back. - Still...	6	3
these two little pissant countries handing our head to us.	6	3
Well, I don't know about the ship,	6	3
but from what I've read, the embassy was an ambush that broke the cease-fire.	6	3
We gave them peace for their sacred holiday.	6	3
Next thing we know, they cut us to ribbons.	6	3
Reminds me of Cuba.	6	3
No one took Fidel Castro seriously.	6	3
We thought he was Señor Wences.	6	3
Turns out he was George Washington.	6	3
And they say surgeons are arrogant.	6	3
Who says that?	6	3
You know we're losing the war.	6	3
Wouldn't know it from looking around here.	6	3
Yeah, it's something, right?	6	3
- You are Dr. Rosen? - You see this service?	6	3
Yes. We'd like to hear the spiel again.	6	3
Uh, scusi. There is a telephone call.	6	3
Really?	6	3
I'll be right back.	6	3
I'm gonna take this as an opportunity to powder my nose.	6	3
There's no answer.	6	3
Is there anyone else? Family?	6	3
My sister's back in Oneonta.	6	3
My mother's in Boca Raton.	6	3
Well, you can't go home. We should find a hotel.	6	3
Let's try some ice.	6	3
What did you say to him?	6	3
Hello? Yes.	6	3
Do you have any vacancies this evening?	6	3
Take me to the city. I want to be with you.	6	3
Absolutely not.	6	3
Very good. Thank you.	6	3
The Old Greenwich has rooms.	6	3
- Can you take me there? - We'll get you a taxi.	6	3
Nonsense. I'll drive you.	6	3
I don't know what I was thinking. I'll run you over.	6	3
Brenda, dear, let's go. It's best this way.	6	3
Emergency averted?	6	3
Unfortunately, no.	6	3
Sylvia and you are having dinner.	6	3
- This is silly. - We can do this another time.	6	3
I'm not taking my foot out of the door of this restaurant.	6	3
Order for four or they'll punish me.	6	3
Good luck.	6	3
What are you having?	6	3
I don't know that I'm that hungry.	6	3
You want another glass of wine? Should we get a bottle?	6	3
You're drinking something else.	6	3
I don't want you to have wine if you don't drink wine.	6	3
I'm not gonna drink a whole bottle, obviously.	6	3
I don't know how obvious that is.	6	3
Another glass is fine.	6	3
So what looks good here?	6	3
Depends what you want.	6	3
Well, I'm hungry, I'm in a good mood,	6	3
and I'd like some guidance on the Italian menu from my favorite Italian.	6	3
I didn't cook it, so I can't speak to its quality.	6	3
You think I'd like eggplant rollatinis?	6	3
For the lovely signora?	6	3
- We're not ready yet. - Yes, we are.	6	3
Can she have another glass of wine	6	3
and could you give us a minute?	6	3
Certo.	6	3
What's wrong?	6	3
How could I possibly know what you like to eat?	6	3
I thought you were looking forward to this.	6	3
I don't know what we're doing.	6	3
We're having dinner together.	6	3
And I'm sorry, but I guess it was a stupid idea to think	6	3
we could spend time together outside of your maid's room.	6	3
Just because they cleared their place settings	6	3
doesn't mean we're alone.	6	3
Is that what's bothering you?	6	3
That everything worked out perfectly?	6	3
And you enjoy how foolish they both look.	6	3
Now I understand.	6	3
You want to feel shitty	6	3
right up until the point where I take your dress off.	6	3
Because I'm going to do that.	6	3
You want to skip dinner? Fine. But don't pretend.	6	3
"""Casta Diva - Norma 1st Act"" playing"	6	3
And what if she had come?	6	3
The evening would be just the same,	6	3
only it would be someone else's dress?	6	3
What are you talking about?	6	3
Weren't you the one who told me you were drifting apart?	6	3
Isn't that what this was about?	6	3
I want you.	6	3
I want you all the time.	6	3
But if you've suddenly decided you want something more than that,	6	3
well, then, that's news, isn't it?	6	3
So, have you decided?	6	3
I don't know. Have you?	6	3
He'll have the steak diavolo	6	3
and I'll have the branzino.	6	3
Anything to start?	6	3
No. We're in a bit of a hurry.	6	3
I'm sorry.	6	3
I'm so sorry.	6	3
I have no right to be jealous.	6	3
This is just us here tonight.	6	3
We have to be careful. We can't fall in love.	6	3
It won't be so French anymore.	6	3
Hi, this is Johnny Carson. As you know,	6	3
"this is the usual starting time for ""The Tonight Show."""	6	3
And tonight my guest is the New Orleans district attorney Mr. Jim Garrison,	6	3
who is with us to discuss, as he puts it,	6	3
some new and vital information concerning the Kennedy assassination.	6	3
But because of the critical war situation in Vietnam,	6	3
especially around Saigon, NBC for the next 15 minutes	6	3
is going to bring you a special news program via satellite.	6	3
So stay with us. We'll return in 15 minutes	6	3
with our guest Mr. Garrison.	6	3
Did you have fun?	6	3
Arnold had an emergency,	6	3
so Sylvia and I had to eat enough	6	3
to keep him in good graces there.	6	3
Are you feeling better?	6	3
I need to talk to you.	6	3
What's wrong?	6	3
Um...	6	3
Well, I had a miscarriage	6	3
a few days ago.	6	3
Are you okay?	6	3
Did you go to the doctor?	6	3
Yes.	6	3
How far along were you?	6	3
Six weeks.	6	3
I wish you would have told me.	6	3
I guess I didn't know how you'd feel.	6	3
I didn't know what you'd want.	6	3
Megan, you have to know I'd want what you want.	6	3
Is that what you want?	6	3
Of course it is.	6	3
But I don't know that it's even	6	3
the right time to have a conversation about it.	6	3
And I guess that's why I didn't tell you.	6	3
But I should have.	6	3
Yes, you should have.	6	3
Do you want to have that conversation?	6	3
Whatever you want.	6	3
Now I can go to sleep.	6	3
Good morning.	6	3
- Where's Tammy? - Leticia took her to the park.	6	3
Oh.	6	3
Well, I'm off.	6	3
Couldn't you just pretend?	6	3
I let you have that apartment.	6	3
Somehow I thought that there was some dignity	6	3
in granting permission.	6	3
All I wanted was for you to be discreet.	6	3
She lives on our block!	6	3
Trudy, don't jump to conclusions.	6	3
There's no way for me to escape.	6	3
To not be an object of pity	6	3
while you get to do whatever you feel like.	6	3
I have never said no to you.	6	3
That is not true. What are we doing out here?	6	3
We're done, Peter. This is over.	6	3
You want a divorce?	6	3
I refuse to be a failure.	6	3
I don't care what you want anymore.	6	3
This is how it's going to work.	6	3
You will be here only when I tell you to be here.	6	3
I'm drawing a 50-mile radius around this house	6	3
and if you so much as open your fly to urinate, I will destroy you.	6	3
Do you understand?	6	3
You know what?	6	3
You're going to go to bed alone tonight	6	3
and you're going to realize you don't know anything for sure.	6	3
I'll live with that.	6	3
- Good morning. - Good morning.	6	3
So far this is all we have,	6	3
but I want you to find out everything you can on Heinz Ketchup.	6	3
What?	6	3
And this is not a joke.	6	3
No. I can't do that.	6	3
Why not?	6	3
It's a little bit of a secret,	6	3
but it turns out they're taking meetings.	6	3
I told you that secret and I shouldn't have.	6	3
Look, everybody's gonna know. We just know a little sooner.	6	3
My friend told me that in confidence.	6	3
He's not your friend.	6	3
- He's the enemy. - Well, he doesn't know that.	6	3
Maybe you need a friend more than you need a job.	6	3
I didn't know that. I'm in advertising.	6	3
It's not that.	6	3
It's just that it was a private conversation.	6	3
What are you, his priest? This is how wars are won.	6	3
Your friend's mistake was underestimating you.	6	3
I hope ketchup makes the same mistake so you can blow their mind.	6	3
So, correct me if I'm wrong, Pete.	6	3
I certainly will.	6	3
You're suggesting that we forego	6	3
this sparkling national ad campaign	6	3
in favor of hard-driving sales ads at the local dealer level?	6	3
Not exactly. We will still have a national presence	6	3
with the sophisticated work that Don presented and you loved,	6	3
but we will increase sales with a surgical	6	3
and financial focus on local media.	6	3
Well, that sounds good to me. Of course, I'm a little bit biased.	6	3
Why would we do that?	6	3
We feel it's best to have a plan that creates customers,	6	3
not just aficionados.	6	3
Don, are you really in favor	6	3
of throwing our emphasis into radio?	6	3
Well, it's hard to argue	6	3
with a more direct appeal to customers.	6	3
I mean, we can artsy up the image of Jaguar,	6	3
make it look romantic and stylish,	6	3
but isn't it better to tell people	6	3
who are actually in the market for a car	6	3
that a Jaguar is available?	6	3
I think it's an exciting new angle	6	3
to use direct sales on a luxury vehicle.	6	3
I mean, forget about radio.	6	3
How about a mailer	6	3
or a circular in the Sunday paper?	6	3
I don't know if that's what we had in mind.	6	3
So this is your recommendation?	6	3
I think it's better to	6	3
think about someone in New Jersey	6	3
driving in their current car	6	3
and hearing that right around the corner	6	3
there's a Jaguar to buy at a low, low price.	6	3
I bet the numbers would support that don't they, Harry?	6	3
That...	6	3
is really a statistics game.	6	3
You know what? I will have to double-check.	6	3
Look, why are you limiting yourself?	6	3
Wouldn't you rather cast a wide net	6	3
so you can sell Jaguar to the average guy?	6	3
You know, truck drivers, housewives.	6	3
I was under the impression from the work you showed us	6	3
that this would be a more elegant approach	6	3
that made the Jaguar seem rare because, let's face it,	6	3
the gentleman who buys our car needs to be of some means.	6	3
I am 100% positive	6	3
that this approach moves cars.	6	3
And not just Jaguars. This is proven to move all kinds of cars.	6	3
Hell, even used cars. Am I wrong, Herb?	6	3
No, he's right. It moves cars.	6	3
Gentlemen, we appreciate the recommendation,	6	3
but we believe we should stay with the proposal	6	3
as first discussed.	6	3
And as persuasive as these arguments were,	6	3
that is how we will continue to proceed.	6	3
Let's not be too hasty. Maybe we should listen to them.	6	3
At least give it some thought.	6	3
Herb's right.	6	3
We still believe this is our best chance for success.	6	3
Fellas, this is gonna work.	6	3
I'm sorry, but this is our final decision.	6	3
Thank you very much.	6	3
What the hell was that?	6	3
Herb, we couldn't have pushed any harder.	6	3
You pushed, then you let Don talk.	6	3
You should know better. The guy's not a salesman.	6	3
That was the deftest self-immolation I've ever seen.	6	3
I don't know what you're talking about.	6	3
I didn't know you were capable of being that bad.	6	3
- What was that in there? - I wasn't feeling well.	6	3
Something about that guy makes me sick.	6	3
Don't be cute. I still have his spit in my hair.	6	3
Why can't you just follow the rules?	6	3
I did. I did exactly what he asked for.	6	3
Not in spirit. You know damn well that is not what he wanted.	6	3
Why do we care what that guy wants?	6	3
- Because he's a client. - Our client.	6	3
And so we just keep saying yes no matter what	6	3
because we didn't say no to begin with?	6	3
You know what this is? It's Munich.	6	3
You guys are always talking about Munich.	6	3
What the hell does that mean anyway?	6	3
It means we gave the Germans whatever they wanted	6	3
to make them happy, but it just made them want more.	6	3
Well, who the hell won the war?	6	3
As my mother used to say,	6	3
your options were dishonor or war.	6	3
You chose dishonor, you might still get war.	6	3
That was Churchill.	6	3
First one in, last one out.	6	3
I don't know how you do it.	6	3
Me either.	6	3
Well, it can't be that bad when you're doing something that you love.	6	3
I'm glad it looks like that to you.	6	3
I spent a year in finance	6	3
watching identical men in identical suits	6	3
sneak drinks out of a desk drawer	6	3
while counting other people's money.	6	3
What house?	6	3
My family's been at Brown Brothers Harriman	6	3
for three generations.	6	3
You make this look a lot better.	6	3
It's all about what it looks like, isn't it?	6	3
I'm going down to the deli.	6	3
Can I get you something?	6	3
No, thank you.	6	3
Bob.	6	3
My wife asked me and I seem to have forgotten.	6	3
Could you pick me up some toilet paper?	6	3
I got it, chief.	6	3
Good evening.	6	3
He's home. You can't knock on the door like that.	6	3
I was taking the trash out and you left it open.	6	3
Tomorrow morning.	6	3

So you haven't officially told anyone	6	4
you're looking to change your life?	6	4
Yes.	6	4
Why put Doyle Dane into hysterics	6	4
when all I want to do is have what NASA calls	6	4
"an ""exploratory mission"" with your agency?"	6	4
Still, Timmy, Don has some anxiety about--	6	4
well, obviously about Raymond.	6	4
Heinz Baked Beans has given us	6	4
national recognition and Raymond's a friend.	6	4
I'm not used to telling people what my account is worth.	6	4
 Not just in billings,	6	4
but in the prestige that comes with ketchup.	6	4
Don knows that or he wouldn't be here.	6	4
He's not that polite.	6	4
Just relax.	6	4
If you do the work and I like it,	6	4
I guarantee that Raymond will fall in line.	6	4
I have that power.	6	4
And if you don't like our work?	6	4
Raymond never has to know.	6	4
I don't know if that solves my problem.	6	4
Look, I understand your risk.	6	4
Or we could have met in your office again.	6	4
In fact, we can have the presentation here, too.	6	4
 No, we'll get a hotel.	6	4
I am supposed to be meeting someone in about 20 minutes	6	4
and she likes me to wait for her.	6	4
Well, take your time.	6	4
And remember,	6	4
I don't need much of an excuse to come to Manhattan.	6	4
When I say a small team, I mean Stan.	6	4
Just the three of us.	6	4
We bill it under Project K.	6	4
Nice place.	6	4
Well, it's available to you.	6	4
You know, if you ever have to spend the night in the city.	6	4
I live here, Pete.	6	4
It's been 7:00 for 20 minutes.	6	4
I'm starving.	6	4
I'm sorry I'm late, but I have a job.	6	4
You know what, Dawn? You have another job,	6	4
which is being my maid of honor.	6	4
Well, I can't lose that one, can I?	6	4
Well, I have some bad news.	6	4
Al called me	6	4
and he said both the caterer and your date fell through.	6	4
William? What happened?	6	4
Al doesn't think he's ready to settle down.	6	4
And he didn't want you to spend the night defending yourself.	6	4
You tell Al to keep looking	6	4
because I'm never gonna meet someone at that office.	6	4
Al and I met at church.	6	4
Church is impossible.	6	4
You can't stand out in that crowd of harlots.	6	4
You stand out.	6	4
You must run into somebody downtown.	6	4
I get on the train and it's just us...	6	4
and then it gets thinner and thinner until about 72nd.	6	4
Sometimes it's just me and this old shoeshine--	6	4
and he won't even look at me.	6	4
Bea Carter says her son Anthony ran into you.	6	4
But that's what you don't understand.	6	4
We were walking through the plaza	6	4
and we passed each other and we just nodded.	6	4
Someone told me he said that,	6	4
but he didn't talk to me.	6	4
And I didn't talk to him, either.	6	4
Well, I'll keep looking.	6	4
That might be too much blush.	6	4
If you look a little rusty, it's 'cause I'm a little rusty.	6	4
I need all the help I can get.	6	4
The makeup's not the important part.	6	4
Mary Kay always says it's really about making yourself feel better,	6	4
and that starts with doing something for you.	6	4
Well, that'll be a first.	6	4
- Kate! - Shh, I just put the baby down.	6	4
- You have not changed. - Well, you have.	6	4
How did you suddenly get younger than me?	6	4
Because she's in the beauty business.	6	4
What do you think?	6	4
- How much did she spend? - It's free.	6	4
This is my old stuff. I'm a sales director now.	6	4
- How are your boys? - Good.	6	4
- Did you see Kevin? - She looked in.	6	4
Why don't we let him sleep while we eat dinner?	6	4
I made a pork roast.	6	4
And I made reservations at Le Cirque for two.	6	4
Well, I want to catch up. And, more importantly,	6	4
Kate has a job interview tomorrow and I don't want her tying one on.	6	4
- Who are you meeting with? - The competition.	6	4
Can we take a raincheck?	6	4
Splendid.	6	4
She hasn't changed.	6	4
Why are you getting on the elevator going up?	6	4
Because the door opened and you were standing there.	6	4
I pressed down.	6	4
Where have you been?	6	4
I missed you.	6	4
Working all the time. Don't tell anyone.	6	4
Like who?	6	4
Arnie's on call Thursday or Friday.	6	4
I'll leave a penny under the mat when he's flown the coop.	6	4
I have to go.	6	4
Can you be more specific?	6	4
Nope.	6	4
Good night.	6	4
Dennis must be doing well.	6	4
- That's from the company. - My goodness.	6	4
What do you have to do to get this?	6	4
Just have a lot of my recruits sell a lot of Mary Kay.	6	4
How much? Those are diamonds.	6	4
Just has to be the most.	6	4
They know what they're doing.	6	4
I know. They do.	6	4
But there's no way for me to move up there.	6	4
So is that why you're going to Avon?	6	4
There's women above me at Mary Kay,	6	4
It's just working out of Spokane,	6	4
there's only so far I can go.	6	4
Well, Joanie's a partner and I don't know if anyone	6	4
would want all that extra responsibility.	6	4
You should visit more often.	6	4
Turns out someone's proud of me.	6	4
I'm a monster.	6	4
"Believe it or not, ""My daughter is a partner"	6	4
"at a Madison Avenue advertising firm"""	6	4
is something I enjoy saying.	6	4
It does sound pretty good.	6	4
Well, so much for keeping my wits about me.	6	4
I should be getting back to the Waldorf.	6	4
Well, I wish you the best of luck tomorrow.	6	4
But if worse come to worse,	6	4
you're appreciated somewhere.	6	4
"What are the ""Life"" magazine closing dates for Birds Eye?"	6	4
Ken, it's Monday.	6	4
I got a perfect cup of coffee and a Danish on the way.	6	4
"You want to start with ""Good morning? How was your weekend?"""	6	4
I spent it with my in-laws listening to Ed complain	6	4
about how much the world hates Dow Chemical.	6	4
And I know that every gripe he has is directed at me and this company.	6	4
Is it possible that this has turned Ken Cosgrove into a neurotic?	6	4
If he wants people to stop hating him,	6	4
he should stop dropping napalm on children.	6	4
I know you just came here to complain,	6	4
but I actually think that I can help you.	6	4
God, that's really true.	6	4
I just came in here to complain.	6	4
How hard would it be to meet with Ed, just you and me?	6	4
If I have a good reason?	6	4
I'm sorry, Mr. Cosgrove, but it's the last one.	6	4
- Did you find your keys? - I did.	6	4
Can you get Pierre Cossette on the line?	6	4
I have an idea. Let's see what happens.	6	4
Harry has great ideas.	6	4
I saw this thing on a spy show.	6	4
It's a clock with a tiny camera in it.	6	4
All we have to do is get it in there.	6	4
If you can get in, you don't need a clock.	6	4
I would guess it's a military account.	6	4
And I would guess they picked Stan	6	4
because he has no conscience.	6	4
So Project K stands for what?	6	4
Project Kill Machine!	6	4
That's not what it stands for.	6	4
So what does it stand for, Bobby?	6	4
I don't know what it is.	6	4
Are you saying that because you do know what it is?	6	4
No.	6	4
- Stan come through? - Stan who?	6	4
I know one thing-- he's not in a room with tinfoil on the windows.	6	4
How are things, Don?	6	4
There's nothing in here.	6	4
'Cause you're gonna fill it with work.	6	4
- If you don't fall asleep. - Mmm.	6	4
I'm telling you, it clears the cobwebs.	6	4
I think a hot dog and a hamburger are too similar.	6	4
Plus, a hot dog cries out for mustard.	6	4
No, I think a hot dog cries out for ketchup.	6	4
A squiggly line.	6	4
Hmm.	6	4
I think we should order lunch.	6	4
Mmm.	6	4
My goodness. Someone's having a party and didn't invite us.	6	4
I don't know what you're talking about.	6	4
Is Clara's birthday today?	6	4
It's tomorrow and it's $2 a head.	6	4
And, actually, I don't know what I'm going to get.	6	4
- Do you want to come? - I can't.	6	4
Mr. Draper always needs me.	6	4
Could you punch me out when you leave?	6	4
Really?	6	4
How long are you going to be gone?	6	4
Well, if you punch me out...	6	4
Okay.	6	4
I heard Mr. Draper's in there.	6	4
No.	6	4
- Did you get the pages? - No.	6	4
Are you two rehearsing already?	6	4
Call me when you see them.	6	4
Arlene, are you sad it's not you?	6	4
You know Mel is my husband.	6	4
I could have him write you into a hospital bed	6	4
or a grave.	6	4
I'm sorry.	6	4
What's going on?	6	4
Well, you're going to have a love scene with Rod.	6	4
And between you, me, and soon a national audience,	6	4
it's more of a love affair.	6	4
Oh, my goodness.	6	4
That's so exciting.	6	4
Thank you for telling me.	6	4
Oh, I did more than tell you.	6	4
Mel's been on the fence,	6	4
but I think he really believes in you.	6	4
Now, don't embarrass me.	6	4
You've done this before, haven't you?	6	4
Um, well, of course.	6	4
Does a high school play count?	6	4
No.	6	4
It's gonna be exciting at first	6	4
and then it'll be part of the job.	6	4
It's pretty exciting.	6	4
"The hard part is how ""James Garner"" there will deal with it."	6	4
Some people think it's better to wait till after it's happened	6	4
or not tell them at all, but I think it's best to be up front.	6	4
Well, obviously he's not going to like it.	6	4
Would you be upset if he did?	6	4
I don't know.	6	4
Why don't Mel and I take you two out to dinner?	6	4
You know, to make him comfortable.	6	4
And, honestly, all of us should be better acquainted.	6	4
I mean, Mel has big plans for you.	6	4
I'm gonna leave you alone with these.	6	4
- Did you send Scarlett somewhere? - No, Meredith.	6	4
Well, it's just I can't find her or Mr. Crane	6	4
and there's someone to see him.	6	4
I'm dying for you to meet Ken.	6	4
How are you?	6	4
Busy.	6	4
Have Scarlett see me when you find her.	6	4
Oh, good. You're home on time.	6	4
I am. It's only because I have a lot of work	6	4
and I don't want to do it in a windowless room.	6	4
So why don't you have a seat?	6	4
I'm gonna get you a drink.	6	4
And then I'm gonna stuff you with coq au vin.	6	4
I know you're very busy,	6	4
but I want us to have, I don't know--	6	4
I want us to be able to talk about things other than work.	6	4
Megan, what happened?	6	4
Just once I'd like to be that wife	6	4
that lays a trap and has her husband walk right into it.	6	4
Okay, first of all, Arlene,	6	4
you know, she plays Penelope Aldridge.	6	4
"She basically owns ""Berkshire Falls."""	6	4
She's married to Mel the head writer	6	4
and they want to have dinner with us.	6	4
Does it get worse?	6	4
Well, my storyline is getting more developed	6	4
and that means	6	4
I'm gonna have a series of love scenes.	6	4
- With whom? - With Rod Holly.	6	4
He plays Rafe Jackson. He's Arlene's nephew.	6	4
Megan, I don't care.	6	4
"What's a ""love scene"" consist of?"	6	4
It's just kissing and hugging.	6	4
It's TV. We can't really do anything.	6	4
What am I supposed to say?	6	4
That you trust me.	6	4
And that you know it's part of my job.	6	4
And maybe that it was bound to happen if things went well.	6	4
Keep going. I'm dying to hear what I say next.	6	4
Should I have hidden it from you?	6	4
I don't know, Megan. I need to think about it.	6	4
Look, I know I wouldn't like it,	6	4
but I'd look on the bright side.	6	4
Okay, I guess if I wasn't your husband,	6	4
I would be happy for you.	6	4
It does mean they like you.	6	4
Do you like me?	6	4
Honey, I can tolerate this, but I can't encourage it.	6	4
You're perfect.	6	4
And, honestly, Ed, it's not just Ken who's been losing sleep about this.	6	4
I mean, last week when half of Colombia got into your lobby--	6	4
It was 15 people.	6	4
Look, you've been in the news every other day	6	4
and a couple of articles placed in business journals	6	4
are not going to make that stop.	6	4
They acted like they were storming the Bastille.	6	4
This is their country, too.	6	4
What exactly is your point?	6	4
Pierre.	6	4
A one-hour prime-time TV special sponsored by Dow,	6	4
starring Joe Namath and 15 or so of his best friends	6	4
putting on a show drawing from America's most beloved musicals.	6	4
"""Broadway Joe on Broadway."""	6	4
Joe Namath sings?	6	4
Don't you want to watch it just to find out?	6	4
"And who are his ""friends""?"	6	4
I have access to the greatest talent available.	6	4
There'll be sex appeal. Joey Heatherton, for example.	6	4
Pipes, Julie Andrews. And punch.	6	4
"How about John Wayne in a sketch version of ""Camelot""?"	6	4
We're mostly household products.	6	4
Women don't like football.	6	4
Have you ever asked them about Joe Namath?	6	4
Forget demographics.	6	4
How would you like Dow to be responsible for making people smile?	6	4
And is there anything that makes people smile	6	4
more than Broadway and football?	6	4
"""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" and the Notre Dame fight song"	6	4
playing at the same time.	6	4
♪ I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy... ♪	6	4
♪ Yankee Doddle, do or die... ♪	6	4
Okay, okay.	6	4
Kenny, did you tell them I went to Notre Dame?	6	4
No, I told them about Joey Heatherton.	6	4
So it's tailor-made for us?	6	4
What's our commitment?	6	4
Well, you'd be a corner tenant.	6	4
There's six minutes of commercials in the hour,	6	4
you'd get three and then two 10-second billboards	6	4
at the beginning and end of the show.	6	4
"""Brought to you by Dow Chemical,"	6	4
"family products for the American family."""	6	4
Just imagine Joe Namath in a straw hat.	6	4
I'm sorry to bother you, Scarlett,	6	4
but is Mr. Crane in?	6	4
Okay. No, he's in a meeting.	6	4
Is there something I can help you with?	6	4
Well, if he's expecting any special guests,	6	4
you should let us know because he had someone come yesterday and you weren't here.	6	4
I must have been in the ladies' room.	6	4
No, and it's strange because you didn't leave until 6:47.	6	4
Oh, Joan, it's Clara's birthday today	6	4
and I tried to go at lunch, but I got stuck at my desk.	6	4
So I left Mr. Crane on his own	6	4
while I attended to this company business.	6	4
We got her a Givenchy scarf from Gimbels.	6	4
I have the card here for you to sign.	6	4
But you never came back and you had Dawn punch your time card.	6	4
No, Dawn and I were working together.	6	4
But we were all over the place.	6	4
But mostly in accounting.	6	4
Thank you for clearing that up.	6	4
Dawn.	6	4
Have you spoken to Scarlett this morning?	6	4
We're missing the big hole punch and I think you were the last one to see her.	6	4
The hole punch is in the creative lounge.	6	4
Dawn, Scarlett told me everything.	6	4
Scarlett, you're fired.	6	4
Joan, please. It won't happen again.	6	4
Not here it won't. Go get your things.	6	4
Dawn, could you get Stan in here	6	4
- before the partners meeting? - I'll deal with you later.	6	4
Girls do it all the time.	6	4
Just go before you really embarrass yourself.	6	4
I hope you realize this means now you're on Ed's radar.	6	4
So will I be invited to Sunday dinner?	6	4
Something like that.	6	4
I don't know where you're going, but I want you to bring back champagne.	6	4
Oh, Harry, I'm not coming back.	6	4
What are you talking about?	6	4
Joan, you owe Scarlett an apology.	6	4
Harry, please don't involve yourself in this.	6	4
I'm tired of your petty dictatorship.	6	4
So whatever capital crime or treason she committed, she's in my department.	6	4
I didn't realize you were that attached to Scarlett.	6	4
- We're not attached. - We are attached!	6	4
I have something more important to do.	6	4
I would hope you do, too.	6	4
Scarlett, do whatever you think is best.	6	4
You are to do whatever I think is best.	6	4
Let's go. Back to work.	6	4
Everything's fine.	6	4
I understand the confidentiality,	6	4
but I need to know how to bill Project K.	6	4
Don't.	6	4
Meredith, why don't you step out?	6	4
I don't know what she said because I'm not privy to these conversations,	6	4
but I would like the chance to defend myself.	6	4
- Mr. Crane, I haven't-- - No, please.	6	4
Let him go on.	6	4
Well, it's this simple-- Scarlett works for me and Joan tried to fire her.	6	4
She left work early and had Dawn punch her time card.	6	4
It's pay for a minimum of five hours of work	6	4
that she didn't do that we are paying for.	6	4
Well, it's either me or her.	6	4
- Joan? - Scarlett.	6	4
"I think you mean, ""If she goes, I go."""	6	4
"""Broadway Joe on Broadway."""	6	4
Is there anybody in here who thought of that?	6	4
- I did. - What the hell is that?	6	4
It's $150,000 worth of incremental business	6	4
I generated while solving a problem. For what?	6	4
So I can stand outside that glass and watch you all in here?	6	4
- What did Dawn do? - Well, I'm almost positive--	6	4
Just keep talking to her because she's a partner.	6	4
You know what?	6	4
I'm sorry my accomplishments happened in broad daylight	6	4
and I can't be given the same rewards.	6	4
What is that supposed to mean?	6	4
You know damn well.	6	4
The next time this group is called to order,	6	4
I expect to be sitting at this table.	6	4
I've actually earned it.	6	4
Don't worry, dear. That's not going to happen.	6	4
Joan, I don't want to put myself in the same camp as Harry,	6	4
but I might remind you and everyone	6	4
the Commission on Human Rights is continuing to investigate	6	4
our industry regarding the employment of Negroes.	6	4
She's a good secretary.	6	4
Of course.	6	4
What about Scarlett?	6	4
I think this humiliation will suffice.	6	4
Can we continue with the billings?	6	4
Yes.	6	4
Where were we?	6	4
"""Meredith, why don't you step out?"""	6	4
Well?	6	4
Oh.	6	4
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave.	6	4
I don't care as long as you brought those bridal magazines.	6	4
What is wrong with you?	6	4
I had a day today that pushed your stupid wedding	6	4
to the bottom of the list.	6	4
- Did you get fired? - No.	6	4
I don't think so.	6	4
Who can tell at that place?	6	4
What happened?	6	4
One of the girls asked me to punch out	6	4
her time card and we got caught.	6	4
I told you, those girls aren't your friends.	6	4
Yes, they are. She got in more trouble than me.	6	4
Why do you think she asked you?	6	4
You can't say no 'cause you're too scared.	6	4
"All they see is, ""Yes, sir."""	6	4
Everybody's scared there.	6	4
Women crying in the ladies' room.	6	4
Men crying in the elevator.	6	4
It sounds like New Year's Eve when they empty the garbage,	6	4
there are so many bottles.	6	4
And I told you about that poor man hanging himself in his office.	6	4
Oh, they got it so bad,	6	4
they must all be jealous of you.	6	4
What am I gonna do? Throw a brick through their window?	6	4
I want to keep my job,	6	4
so I'm gonna keep my head down.	6	4
Well, I couldn't do it.	6	4
Well, you don't have to.	6	4
You're getting married.	6	4
And dinner.	6	4
I should have brought Dennis.	6	4
You're not even listening to me.	6	4
I'm sorry. I need a drink	6	4
and this place is a soda fountain.	6	4
I feel like I'm in high school right down to the clientele.	6	4
Hello?	6	4
We're sitting here waiting for a phone to ring.	6	4
This actually is high school.	6	4
So what do you do to have fun?	6	4
I don't look in a guidebook.	6	4
This wasn't in a guidebook, okay?	6	4
My friend told me about it.	6	4
Is she a nun or just the right age for this place?	6	4
Apparently there are quite a few men here	6	4
who go for a certain type.	6	4
Oh.	6	4
Joanie, don't judge me. I'm in New York.	6	4
Good evening, ladies.	6	4
If there's anything you need, I'll be over there.	6	4
Catherine's got a lot of tables, so don't hesitate.	6	4
I'm Leo.	6	4
I'm Kate. And this is Joan.	6	4
Actually, I don't think our phone is working.	6	4
- Can you test it? - I'll see what I can do.	6	4
How many girls come in here and complain that their phones are broken?	6	4
He's cute. Reminds me of Scotty.	6	4
Well, don't marry him.	6	4
That was the worst six months of my life.	6	4
You always did everything first.	6	4
But you did everything smart.	6	4
Well, tonight we're just a couple of young secretaries.	6	4
Answer it.	6	4
Ahem. Hello?	6	4
How did you do that?	6	4
I didn't do anything. He likes you.	6	4
What?	6	4
Oh.	6	4
Just a minute. Let me ask my girlfriend.	6	4
He wants us to meet him after his shift.	6	4
Well, tell him you know a place.	6	4
But I don't. Do you?	6	4
- Should I invite him to my room? - No.	6	4
We were just trying to think of a place.	6	4
Tell him to think of a place.	6	4
Do you know of a place?	6	4
Oh, good.	6	4
- Hang up. - Till then.	6	4
Okay, now I need a drink.	6	4
Do you honestly believe a few jokes	6	4
"on the ""Smothers Brothers"" are really upsetting people?"	6	4
I think it's the sponsors and the network	6	4
don't want to have a conversation about the war.	6	4
I'd like to have an evening without a conversation about the war.	6	4
Darling, you shouldn't smoke so much.	6	4
The weight you lose isn't worth the wrinkles.	6	4
See, I think the sponsors are for the war.	6	4
They don't want to have any dissent.	6	4
Don, you're a writer. You know this is censorship.	6	4
I am a writer and I'm against the war,	6	4
but when you buy a commercial,	6	4
you're hoping that the consumer	6	4
is in a good mood when they hear your message.	6	4
So if you agree on a wholesome variety show	6	4
and all of a sudden it's filled with satire--	6	4
the most threatening humor there is--	6	4
you're worried about people hating what you're selling.	6	4
Megan, let's talk about you	6	4
and how you found this man.	6	4
I could cast you, you know that.	6	4
Yes, I'm sure he is a man who plays many roles.	6	4
Luckily you don't have to worry about censorship	6	4
with the show because it's so tame.	6	4
Of course it's for daytime entertainment.	6	4
It's for housewives.	6	4
It has to be a little titillating.	6	4
We have our own standards.	6	4
Although they've been very liberal with us.	6	4
But, you know,	6	4
when we do things on the show,	6	4
it's all very tasteful.	6	4
Well, it's not real life.	6	4
Why don't you let me get the check?	6	4
We go back to our pad, smoke some grass,	6	4
and... see what happens.	6	4
Sounds like fun.	6	4
I don't know. It's late.	6	4
It's not.	6	4
Look, if you don't smoke grass, that's fine.	6	4
It's not everything we had in mind.	6	4
I'm not sure if I understand.	6	4
We like Megan.	6	4
And we like you.	6	4
And we'd like to be friends.	6	4
Us, too.	6	4
Well, then...	6	4
I guess it's not impossible under the right circumstances	6	4
for us to become better acquainted.	6	4
Hey, it may not work. It's a chemistry experiment.	6	4
I have a big day tomorrow. You both know that.	6	4
That's work. This is play.	6	4
I have to get up very early.	6	4
That's what black coffee is for.	6	4
I make it delicious.	6	4
Uh...	6	4
maybe another time.	6	4
"Arlene, we've heard ""no"" before."	6	4
I guess there's no reason to skip dessert.	6	4
What?	6	4
This is the best seat.	6	4
St. Marks between 2nd and 3rd, please.	6	4
Have you been to the Electric Circus?	6	4
- All the time. - We're from out of town.	6	4
Let's see who kisses better.	6	4
I'm not playing this game.	6	4
Because she'll lose.	6	4
What the hell was that?	6	4
What? They like you and they like me.	6	4
They'd like us to be friends.	6	4
They were so out in the open.	6	4
It was a good strategy. I kept thinking	6	4
he was going to ask me for a job directing commercials.	6	4
Maybe he was waiting for tomorrow morning	6	4
- when we were basking in the afterglow. - Don't.	6	4
Just a pile of arms and legs.	6	4
I don't know whether to laugh or be sick	6	4
because now I think	6	4
that's the reason they gave me the scene.	6	4
I'm sure they've tried that	6	4
with plenty of people who haven't gotten scenes.	6	4
Don, I have to go back to work with them.	6	4
It'll be better than ever. How long have they been married?	6	4
18 years.	6	4
I'm busy.	6	4
Come up for air.	6	4
Oh, hey.	6	4
Would you mind?	6	4
This is my friend.	6	4
I'm Johnny.	6	4
Joan. Pleased to meet you.	6	4
Johnny and Joan.	6	4
Bonnie and Clyde.	6	4
- Do you want a drink? - I have one.	6	4
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪	6	4
What'd I say?	6	4
What did he say?	6	4
He said I'd want you.	6	4
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪	6	4
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪	6	4
Well, war or no war,	6	4
Nixon doesn't think he's running against Johnson.	6	4
He thinks he's running against the ghost of Kennedy.	6	4
So does Johnson.	6	4
I don't know where Helen is.	6	4
How are you both this morning?	6	4
Frankly, we're a little embarrassed.	6	4
Well, if that has anything to do with me, I apologize. That was not my intention.	6	4
How are Jennifer, Bea, and the twins?	6	4
It's Nathan and Steven, right?	6	4
Yes.	6	4
They're well, thank you.	6	4
That display yesterday of--	6	4
well, of initiative	6	4
really caught our attention.	6	4
This is a check for $23,500.	6	4
"That's the full commission on ""Broadway Joe."""	6	4
Well, thank you.	6	4
That's a lot of money.	6	4
So, anything else to say?	6	4
I'm puzzled. What do you make a year, Mr. Crane?	6	4
22. So what about the partnership?	6	4
You want some of the spoils. Well, there you go.	6	4
We have to get bigger before we get bigger.	6	4
What a load of crap.	6	4
- You know, Joan's not even in yet. - Leave her out of this.	6	4
Bert, you know how important I am	6	4
to this company. You were me.	6	4
I was different than you, Mr. Crane, in every way.	6	4
- So you don't want the money? - No, I've earned the money.	6	4
But I've also earned a partnership.	6	4
I really hope some other firm doesn't figure that out first.	6	4
That was the most impressive thing he's done.	6	4
Should we fire him before he cashes that check?	6	4
- Aren't you gonna be late? - Aren't you?	6	4
I love you.	6	4
Wish me luck.	6	4
Good luck.	6	4
I'm really waking you this time.	6	4
Kate.	6	4
Honey, wake up.	6	4
Now you two layabouts have to bathe him.	6	4
I have an appointment.	6	4
Mom, I'm still going to work.	6	4
Do you need to throw up?	6	4
Mother, can you give us a minute?	6	4
Why did I do that?	6	4
You had some fun.	6	4
I just wanted to try it.	6	4
Now you'll go home and you'll find everything right where it belongs.	6	4
I'm really not you, am I?	6	4
Why would you want to be?	6	4
Are you kidding?	6	4
Look what you did.	6	4
You came out here,	6	4
you staked this out on your own.	6	4
I always had Dennis to fall back on.	6	4
Even when I went to Mary Kay.	6	4
You didn't.	6	4
And I never will.	6	4
How'd that happen?	6	4
The whole reason I even talked to Avon	6	4
is because I wanted...	6	4
I don't know,	6	4
what you have.	6	4
It's not what you think.	6	4
You're an executive.	6	4
It's a title.	6	4
And money.	6	4
I've been working there for 15 years	6	4
and they still treat me like a secretary.	6	4
What's it have to do with them?	6	4
You're there, Joan.	6	4
And from where I'm sitting, it's damn impressive.	6	4
I don't care how they make you feel,	6	4
it's right in front of you for the taking.	6	4
I'll be back in an hour.	6	4
There you go.	6	4
Oh.	6	4
Okay, I'll draw the bath.	6	4
It's clean, it's simple,	6	4
and it's tantalizingly incomplete.	6	4
What's missing? One thing.	6	4
"""Pass the Heinz."""	6	4
You mean the Heinz Ketchup.	6	4
It's Heinz. It only means one thing.	6	4
It feels like half an ad.	6	4
The greatest thing you have working for you	6	4
is not the photo you take or the picture you paint.	6	4
It's the imagination of the consumer.	6	4
They have no budget. They have no time limit.	6	4
And if you can get into that space,	6	4
your ad can run all day.	6	4
Well, Pete, you said I'd say it.	6	4
It's pretty bold work.	6	4
I think I still want to see our bottle.	6	4
I thought that at first, too, but--	6	4
We will test it both ways.	6	4
It's a testament to ketchup	6	4
that there can be no confusion.	6	4
Let me chew on it, fellas.	6	4
You're going to be thinking of ketchup all day	6	4
and you didn't even see it.	6	4
Thank you.	6	4
We'll be in touch.	6	4
Well, hello.	6	4
Hello.	6	4
Ted, you want to come in?	6	4
I hope you left us something.	6	4
Good to see you.	6	4
It's a bake-off? Since when?	6	4
- Come on, Don. - Go wait by the elevator.	6	4
Peggy.	6	4
So, what's the difference between ketchup and catsup?	6	4
Well, catsup has more tomatoes,	6	4
comes in a bigger bottle,	6	4
is cheaper, but tastes just like ketchup.	6	4
Now, we know that's not true,	6	4
but that's what your competitors are saying.	6	4
Over and over.	6	4
And they're selling their watered-down, flavorless sauce	6	4
by pretending that they're you.	6	4
Makes you angry, doesn't it?	6	4
Me, too.	6	4
But I always say	6	4
if you don't like what they're saying,	6	4
change the conversation.	6	4
"""Heinz. The only ketchup."""	6	4
Imagine this 40 feet tall	6	4
in Times Square.	6	4
Ketchup versus catsup--	6	4
end of conversation.	6	4
- Good morning. - Good afternoon.	6	4
Thank you.	6	4
Joan, may I have a word?	6	4
I'm sorry I was not more forthright with you.	6	4
I think it would only be fair if you docked my pay	6	4
to cover the hours Scarlett did not work.	6	4
Fair to whom? Scarlett?	6	4
I don't know. Fair to the company?	6	4
This is the key to the supply closet	6	4
and this is the key to the time cards.	6	4
You will be responsible for monitoring both.	6	4
What?	6	4
Okay.	6	4
- Thank you. - Don't thank me.	6	4
You don't understand that this is punishment.	6	4
Well, I don't care if everybody hates me here	6	4
as long as you don't.	6	4
We'll see.	6	4
So there's two of us.	6	4
We're both the same size agency.	6	4
You're not afraid of a little heads-up baseball.	6	4
I only did it because no one else was supposed to know.	6	4
I think everything should be done in secret.	6	4
Lock me in that Project K room, I'll work on anything, Don.	6	4
I miss it already.	6	4
Mind if we join the Lonely Hearts Club?	6	4
Who says we're not celebrating?	6	4
J. Walter Thompson. They bought it in the room.	6	4
Are you kidding me? We paid for that room.	6	4
What do you know?	6	4
The biggest agency in the world.	6	4
Oh, I'm glad you're here.	6	4
See, I just got off the phone with Raymond Geiger	6	4
and he said that you were at the Roosevelt	6	4
giving a presentation to the ketchup brand manager.	6	4
But I said that was impossible because how could that happen	6	4
at my firm without me knowing?	6	4
Because no one was supposed to know.	6	4
Let me get a rye rocks and an Old Spanish.	6	4
I'm sorry, Ken. Damn it.	6	4
I'll call him. I'll work it out.	6	4
Don't bother.	6	4
He doesn't even want to give us 90 days.	6	4
There's nothing better than being known for your loyalty.	6	4
You hear that, Ted?	6	4
Vinegars, sauces, and beans is available.	6	4
Help yourself. It's a gold mine.	6	4
They'd love that.	6	4
There's a pie and they slice it into pieces	6	4
and they throw the tiniest piece into the yard	6	4
and let all the small agencies fight over it.	6	4
Speak for yourself.	6	4
It was worth the risk.	6	4
I think I see a friend.	6	4
Please, Rafe, you have a family.	6	4
I have a family that ignores me,	6	4
that treats me like I've never been there.	6	4
But you, you make me feel new again.	6	4
I work for you.	6	4
And for her.	6	4
She's good to me.	6	4
Stop fighting.	6	4
I don't know how much longer I can take this.	6	4
This is your bed you share with her.	6	4
I can't.	6	4
Rafe, we can't.	6	4
Corinne, don't deny this, what's between us.	6	4
Don't deny me when I know you feel it too.	6	4
I do.	6	4
Rafe.	6	4
You like to watch, do you?	6	4
Oh, Rafe.	6	4
And we're clear.	6	4
Everyone to the conservatory set.	6	4
- Very nice, everyone. - You did great.	6	4
Thank you.	6	4
Megan, your agent's here.	6	4
That was steamy.	6	4
So I should go change and we can go.	6	4
I'll keep you company.	6	4
What are you doing here?	6	4
Because you didn't want me to see that?	6	4
No, and I don't understand why you'd do that to yourself.	6	4
It's a hell of a lot better than letting my imagination run wild.	6	4
The first time you come to set is for this?	6	4
I've been here for months. What did you think was going to happen?	6	4
I didn't expect you to enjoy it.	6	4
It's acting, Don.	6	4
Were you gonna brush your teeth at least before you came home?	6	4
I'm sick of tiptoeing around you every time something good happens to me.	6	4
This is my job. No, my career.	6	4
You kiss people for money. You know who does that?	6	4
You couldn't stop it, so I guess ruining it was enough for you.	6	4
Would you rather have not known?	6	4
You never watch the show. It'd be like it never happened.	6	4
Why don't you have dinner with Arlene and Mel tonight?	6	4
They're much more open-minded.	6	4
That's been out there all day.	6	4
Was it going to be out there all night?	6	4
Yes.	6	4
- Take that off. - Why?	6	4
It doesn't mean anything to you.	6	4
It does to you.	6	4
It does.	6	4
So what do you do when I leave here?	6	4
Get on your knees and pray for absolution?	6	4
I pray for you.	6	4
For me to come back?	6	4
No.	6	4
For you to find peace.	6	4
( theme music playing )	6	5
Woman: 1,290 square feet.	6	5
Let's call it 13 with the balcony.	6	5
One and a half bathrooms.	6	5
That means it's a full bath and a powder room.	6	5
Two bedrooms, 11th floor,	6	5
One parking spot with an option for a second.	6	5
And at $28,000,	6	5
I do believe that was everything on your list.	6	5
It's a little farther east than I wanted.	6	5
In fact, it's about as far east as you could go.	6	5
 You can see the highway from the corner.	6	5
You can see the river.	6	5
And who needs central park	6	5
When you can smell the ocean and the hungarian bakeries?	6	5
Believe me, when they finish the second avenue subway,	6	5
This apartment will quadruple in value.	6	5
- ( doorbell rings ) - oh, that's barbara.	6	5
You let me do the talking.	6	5
Sorry I'm late.	6	5
It's quite a hike between first and york.	6	5
It's got to be longer than a normal block.	6	5
I don't think so.	6	5
We just got started.	6	5
What do you think?	6	5
 I think no one's gonna catch that doorman napping.	6	5
I left your name.	6	5
It's got a doorman.	6	5
I was telling peggy that an offer is coming in at asking price.	6	5
We'd have to beat it.	6	5
So it's in your best interest to be decisive	6	5
And take this property seriously.	6	5
Well, okay, but it's not my decision.	6	5
Ginny, we are taking this seriously.	6	5
- What abe means is-- - I'm more her trusted advisor.	6	5
An interested party.	6	5
Oh. I see.	6	5
I, uh, misunderstood.	6	5
I'm going to flush that toilet again.	6	5
She didn't know I wasn't the buyer?	6	5
So all this time she was just being rude.	6	5
( laughs ) forget about her.	6	5
Is it too far east?	6	5
Betty: Dinner.	6	5
Bobby, sally, let's go.	6	5
( elevator bell dings )	6	5
Look at you two. Heading to the track?	6	5
( laughs )	6	5
- Where are you going? - Dc, if jonesy can find a cab.	6	5
- Hope you're not in a rush. - We have a car coming.	6	5
6:30? We should have done that.	6	5
We're not going to miss the train.	6	5
Where are you going?	6	5
They said dc.	6	5
I mean, why are you going?	6	5
Arnie was invited last minute to give a keynote address.	6	5
Did you have to tell him it was last minute?	6	5
I guess the point is somebody more important fell out.	6	5
It's a very distinguished group.	6	5
And you must have been at least as important.	6	5
Either way, it sounds like a good excuse for a weekend in washington.	6	5
Yes. Come Monday morning, it'll all be a dream.	6	5
We should really go away.	6	5
Looks like you're going somewhere fun now.	6	5
We are. Megan's up for an award.	6	5
Good for you. Maybe tomorrow	6	5
You'll be calling the producers and asking for a raise.	6	5
No, it's for advertising.	6	5
The ad club of new york.	6	5
- Paul newman's coming. - My goodness.	6	5
You're really good at everything.	6	5
I was just a name on the team.	6	5
There's the car.	6	5
Well, break a leg.	6	5
You, too.	6	5
Oh, and, don...	6	5
We're going to dc.	6	5
( laughs )	6	5
Hey, pop, I--	6	5
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?	6	5
We were waiting for you.	6	5
Look, miss, whatever he told you we were interested in,	6	5
- We're not. - See how funny he is?	6	5
Now, don't be rude. This is beverly farber.	6	5
She is chaim farber's daughter.	6	5
I'm-- our dads, they play chess together.	6	5
Oh, uh...	6	5
Well, I... It's nice to meet you.	6	5
And now that you're home from a busy day	6	5
On madison avenue,	6	5
I think you should go out and have some dinner.	6	5
What?	6	5
Maybe we should do this another time.	6	5
Nonsense. There's no time like the present.	6	5
You both should have some fun.	6	5
She's a schoolteacher. She works all the time.	6	5
I need to shave, change my clothes, prepare.	6	5
I mean, look at her. She had a jump on me.	6	5
( laughs ) I did.	6	5
I was led to believe that you knew about this.	6	5
- Why did you tell her that? - What's the difference?	6	5
Look at her. I'm obviously doing you a disservice.	6	5
At least we're close to the kitchen.	6	5
It's not fair that all the big agencies are up front.	6	5
Closer to their trophies.	6	5
But at least we're gonna eat before them.	6	5
Oh, I see peggy back there. We should go say hello.	6	5
- I'm gonna wait for the group. - You can't avoid her forever.	6	5
I'm not.	6	5
Tell her that no matter what,	6	5
Her laxative radio spot is the sentimental favorite.	6	5
Megan: Hello, stranger.	6	5
I was hoping I'd see you.	6	5
You know, other than on tv.	6	5
- You don't watch. - My mother and sister do.	6	5
Really? Do they hate me?	6	5
Oh, just a minute.	6	5
Megan, I want you to meet jim cutler.	6	5
He's the president of cgc.	6	5
This is megan draper. She's also a finalist.	6	5
You must be don's wife.	6	5
When I started out, they didn't make	6	5
Copywriters like you.	6	5
Good luck.	6	5
He's the head of accounts.	6	5
He's like roger with bad breath.	6	5
So he knows who you are. It must be going well.	6	5
If I survive tonight.	6	5
Cgc has no other finalists.	6	5
Other-- they have none.	6	5
I only came because it seemed important to don.	6	5
I bet it is. We're the only finalists from scdp	6	5
And neither of us work there anymore.	6	5
My work was for beans	6	5
And they aren't even a client anymore.	6	5
I don't want to talk about this.	6	5
I want to talk about my apartment.	6	5
I made an offer today. I think we're gonna be neighbors.	6	5
- 84th and york. - You're buying a place?	6	5
Well, I paid off my debts and helped out my mother	6	5
And it turns out I still have this tax problem.	6	5
Don't apologize, peggy. You deserve it.	6	5
Thank you.	6	5
I should get back.	6	5
I have to walk all the way down to the front.	6	5
You're terrible.	6	5
Joan: These are the worst seats in the room.	6	5
- Don draper, this is randall walsh. - A pleasure to meet you.	6	5
Randy here is in insurance and he wants to come in for an official visit.	6	5
Look, man, it's not like we're not supposed to talk about business here.	6	5
You want a presentation right now?	6	5
I don't think we'll interrupt the proceedings, wherever they are.	6	5
- I just thought you two should meet. - We've already met.	6	5
In fact, I'm pretty sure we've had this meeting already, too.	6	5
- And it went well. - So where's our check?	6	5
- He's solid. - Okay, randy.	6	5
Go get back in your cage.	6	5
- What was that? - Don't worry about it.	6	5
Have no fear. They're gonna fire off a cannon	6	5
- When the atrocities begin. - ( laughter )	6	5
Hello all. You remember my wife nan.	6	5
Hello, everyone. Good luck.	6	5
I told you, nan, peggy's the only one competing.	6	5
Well, I didn't know what else to say.	6	5
So you probably figured out by now that you didn't win.	6	5
- Ted. - But it doesn't matter, because next year you will.	6	5
- Ted. - And the year after. Just a second, honey.	6	5
- Hey, man, sorry. - Oh, I'm in your seat.	6	5
Nan, you wanted to see paul newman.	6	5
Here he is.	6	5
- Here you go. - Thank you.	6	5
Emcee: Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to welcome you	6	5
To the advertising club of new york's	6	5
Fourth annual andy awards for excellence in advertising.	6	5
( applause )	6	5
So you like kids?	6	5
Excuse me?	6	5
I was asking because you're a teacher,	6	5
But I realize how that could sound like something else.	6	5
I'm a student teacher.	6	5
I'm getting my master's at hunter.	6	5
And, yes, I like kids. Some kids.	6	5
I just really can't believe he brought you to the apartment.	6	5
Stop saying that. You don't know where I live.	6	5
Well, it's kind of early to find out, isn't it?	6	5
Yes, I suppose it is.	6	5
I don't know what you're expecting.	6	5
I mean, a couple of alter kockers arrange a little meeting like this,	6	5
It sounds very old world. But it doesn't feel like it.	6	5
I mean, you're a sexy girl and you smell great.	6	5
You don't need to be set up.	6	5
And I sure as hell didn't arrange this.	6	5
I'm sure my father told you what a lothario I am,	6	5
But I'm not. I'm very anxious about it.	6	5
I've never had sex, not even once.	6	5
( laughs ) okay.	6	5
What am I doing? I ordered soup, I just said that.	6	5
Michael...	6	5
I'm just doing a favor for my parents.	6	5
Tonight will not be the night.	6	5
And I saw a picture of you	6	5
And, honestly, you're very handsome.	6	5
And I'm obviously very shallow.	6	5
- I am? - You must have heard that before.	6	5
So...	6	5
Do you make a lot of money teaching?	6	5
( laughs ) no.	6	5
Emcee: Ladies and gentlemen, paul newman.	6	5
Newman: Good evening. I am paul newman.	6	5
The advertising club of new york	6	5
Has been kind enough to let me say a few words here tonight.	6	5
And I want to make one thing clear from the very start.	6	5
- I need binoculars. - Shh.	6	5
Newman: I'm not here because I'm an actor.	6	5
We invited him because he's an actor.	6	5
Newman: I'm here because I've got six kids and I'm worried about...	6	5
That's not an actor, that's a speck.	6	5
Gene mccarthy stood up to lyndon johnson	6	5
Before bobby kennedy.	6	5
The others backed into the election	6	5
With their fingers to the wind,	6	5
Thinking of their own career when the nation	6	5
Was in critical need of a hero.	6	5
I know bobby kennedy,	6	5
But I'm supporting gene mccarthy	6	5
For president of the United States.	6	5
( applause )	6	5
Man: Mr. Newman, sir.	6	5
Do you know, mr. Newman, sir, that martin luther king is dead?	6	5
- What have you to say? - ( crowd murmuring )	6	5
No, that can't be.	6	5
Who the hell said that?	6	5
Woman: How awful.	6	5
Emcee: If I could have your attention for a moment, please.	6	5
A moment of your attention.	6	5
Not wanting to interrupt the festivities,	6	5
We hoped to keep this news until the end of the event.	6	5
As it stands, let's take 10 minutes	6	5
To talk out this terrible event	6	5
And then resume the program.	6	5
What do you think happened?	6	5
- What do you think? - Come on.	6	5
I guess puerto rico.	6	5
But who has time?	6	5
Your father says you've even written some billboards.	6	5
That must be exciting.	6	5
You'd think so, but they usually change it so much	6	5
By the time they put it up there, it just makes you angry every time you walk by.	6	5
- ( laughs ) - man on radio: ...In memphis, tennessee,	6	5
After being shot in the face by an unknown assailant	6	5
On the balcony in front of a downtown hotel a short while ago.	6	5
- ( plate shatters ) - associated press says assistant police chief	6	5
Henry lux of memphis confirmed dr. King's death.	6	5
- Reverend dr. King, winner of the nobel peace prize... - Oh, my god.	6	5
- ...Was 39 years old. - They had to do it.	6	5
He was in memphis to lead demonstrations	6	5
In sympathy with a prolonged strike	6	5
By municipal garbage men, most of them negro.	6	5
Police at last report were still looking	6	5
For a young white male who was seen running	6	5
From the scene of the shooting	6	5
And reportedly dropped the weapon in flight.	6	5
What are you doing in here? Thought you'd be by the set.	6	5
- She won't let us watch. - Because who knows what they're going to show?	6	5
You don't have to go.	6	5
Betty, they're gonna burn down the city.	6	5
Everything's fine. I have to go help the mayor.	6	5
Please be careful.	6	5
- And call me. - Man on radio: We repeat,	6	5
Dr. Martin luther king, america's nonviolent civil rights...	6	5
What is taking so long?	6	5
There are other people here who need to make calls.	6	5
They shot him in the face in memphis.	6	5
Do they know who?	6	5
Come on, they didn't catch him yet, but you know who.	6	5
Listen, jimmy says they can get me a photographer if I can get uptown.	6	5
No, it's not a good idea.	6	5
"It's the ""new york times."""	6	5
- And what? - It's a huge story.	6	5
( sirens wailing )	6	5
- Don't do anything stupid. - Peggy, it's too late.	6	5
I'm going to harlem in a tuxedo.	6	5
I can't believe this.	6	5
Abe just went uptown for work.	6	5
I'm sick and I don't even know how I'm gonna get home.	6	5
We'll give you a ride.	6	5
I'm tired of waiting for a phone. I'm going home.	6	5
What are we doing? They're really still having the awards?	6	5
What else are we gonna do?	6	5
Look, I'm sure it's hard to sleep.	6	5
What is that?	6	5
What are you doing?	6	5
I didn't do it. It peeled off.	6	5
Why are you destroying this house?	6	5
( sighs ) you can't do this.	6	5
I didn't do anything.	6	5
I don't want to talk about it now.	6	5
Please just go to sleep.	6	5
( door closes )	6	5
...The civil rights movement	6	5
Has been shot to death in memphis, tennessee.	6	5
Police have issued an all-points bulletin...	6	5
It's me.	6	5
Oh.	6	5
How are you?	6	5
Not good.	6	5
I don't know why I'm so surprised.	6	5
It's shameful.	6	5
Listen, I...	6	5
( sirens wailing )	6	5
I don't want you and tammy to be alone.	6	5
I could come out and sleep there tonight if you want.	6	5
No, I--	6	5
We'll be fine.	6	5
Well, I want to see tammy.	6	5
Is she all right?	6	5
She doesn't know what's going on.	6	5
No, of course.	6	5
I'll see you on Saturday.	6	5
No, I'll just tell my parents	6	5
You couldn't get out of the city.	6	5
Or I'll just cancel it altogether.	6	5
Trudy.	6	5
What?	6	5
I don't want you to be worried.	6	5
Okay.	6	5
Man on tv: In a nationwide television address,	6	5
President johnson expressed the nation's shock.	6	5
Good night, peter.	6	5
Good night.	6	5
Johnson: ...Of dr. Martin luther king.	6	5
I ask every citizen	6	5
To reject the blind violence	6	5
That has struck dr. King,	6	5
Who lived by nonviolence.	6	5
Pop, wake up.	6	5
What time is it?	6	5
What are you doing home so early?	6	5
We cut it short.	6	5
Martin luther king got killed.	6	5
( sirens wailing )	6	5
Reporter: ...Try and cool things down.	6	5
In boston, according to police reports,	6	5
A large crowd of negroes stoned six police cruisers	6	5
Near a negro housing project in the roxbury section.	6	5
And there was a clash between police and young negroes	6	5
In raleigh's main downtown streets tonight.	6	5
The latest report of trouble comes from washington, dc,	6	5
Where stores along a six-block area	6	5
Were broken into late this evening.	6	5
- ( speaking french ) - president johnson went on nationwide television	6	5
To express his shock and personal grief at the tragedy.	6	5
( speaking french )	6	5
...Looking subdued and grim at the thought	6	5
Of what this act could mean in a country	6	5
Already taut with racial tension.	6	5
He said he applauded the escalation of decay.	6	5
So sick of that marxist bull_ó_.	6	5
So far it's only looting in harlem,	6	5
But a lot of places are on fire.	6	5
Well, it's raining.	6	5
Do you think your secretary is okay?	6	5
Sylvia and arnold are in dc.	6	5
My father just hides behind his intellect.	6	5
He doesn't want to feel any emotions.	6	5
Let's watch inside.	6	5
Maybe we can fall asleep.	6	5
( tv turns off )	6	5
( phones ringing )	6	5
- ( knocks ) - am I disturbing you?	6	5
No. I'm not gonna judge you if you want a drink.	6	5
The man knew how to talk.	6	5
I don't know why, but I thought that would save him.	6	5
I thought it would solve the whole thing.	6	5
Oh, I don't know if he just wants to hold hands,	6	5
But my insurance friend from last night, he called.	6	5
He wants to come in at 3:00.	6	5
I'll have caroline remind you since you're on your own.	6	5
Could you get the door?	6	5
Yes, actually, I'm trying to reach dr. Rosen.	6	5
No, I'm not a patient.	6	5
I just know that he's in washington and--	6	5
Well, I was concerned.	6	5
I'm his neighbor.	6	5
Oh, well, if you do reach him,	6	5
Just say...	6	5
Actually, no message.	6	5
I'll try later.	6	5
( radio playing )	6	5
Oh, you're here.	6	5
I'm sorry. There's no reception out there.	6	5
No, I just-- I didn't expect you to come in.	6	5
I kept calling and no one answered.	6	5
We went out to my aunt's in newark.	6	5
Why would you do that?	6	5
My mother wanted to be with her sister.	6	5
Abe said it could have been a lot worse.	6	5
I'm so sorry.	6	5
I knew it was going to happen.	6	5
He knew it was going to happen.	6	5
But it's not gonna stop anything.	6	5
And these fools running in the streets--	6	5
It's exactly what he didn't want.	6	5
You should go home.	6	5
In fact, none of us should be working.	6	5
Thank you.	6	5
Is this really what happened?	6	5
You didn't tell me anything.	6	5
They got it right, except that it was terrifying.	6	5
Walking into that angry, crazy crowd	6	5
And lindsay smiling like he was going to a pancake breakfast.	6	5
The only lives his honor seemed worried about protecting	6	5
Were the photographers'.	6	5
- But it worked. - I'll tell you what worked.	6	5
Cutting deals with all the militants last year.	6	5
Well, I'm glad you were there.	6	5
Me, too. And I got to go back in.	6	5
I want you to eat something first.	6	5
- ( phone ringing ) - clara.	6	5
Have you seen scarlett?	6	5
Where's my girl?	6	5
They must all be watching tv somewhere.	6	5
- Not in my office. - I barely slept last night.	6	5
I just thought working might take my mind off things.	6	5
Good luck. Been on the phone all morning.	6	5
They're worried about last night, obviously,	6	5
But they're worried about tonight, they're worried about the weekend.	6	5
- Who? - The clients.	6	5
They won't take make-goods. They want money back.	6	5
- That's disgusting. - I don't know.	6	5
It's enough of this crap already.	6	5
All these special broadcasts preempting the prime-time schedule.	6	5
"""bewitched,"" merv, dean martin."	6	5
You know they might cancel the stanley cup?	6	5
How dare you?	6	5
This cannot be made good.	6	5
It's shameful.	6	5
It's a shameful, shameful day!	6	5
Don't you scream at me.	6	5
You don't think I'm upset about that man being shot?	6	5
Only because it's costing you, you pig!	6	5
It's costing all of us.	6	5
Until they turn the most beautiful city in the world into a s_ó_ hole.	6	5
- Gentlemen, stop it. Stop it this minute. - In a second, bert.	6	5
Did you know we were in the presence of a bona fide racist?	6	5
That's the latest thing, isn't it? Everybody's a racist.	6	5
Gentlemen!	6	5
I urge you to shake hands in the spirit of erasing these remarks.	6	5
I'm sorry.	6	5
I suppose that my comments were inappropriate.	6	5
I mistook this for a workday.	6	5
Don't worry. I'm sure you can make your money back	6	5
On some movie of the week next fall	6	5
About the death of a great man.	6	5
That is not what I meant.	6	5
Let me put this in terms you'll understand.	6	5
That man had a wife and four children.	6	5
( doors slam )	6	5
( knocks )	6	5
I'm sorry I'm late.	6	5
Would you like coffee?	6	5
Dawn, I'm just glad you're okay.	6	5
Joan was trying to reach you.	6	5
The phone was out for a little bit last night	6	5
And, well, it took some time to get here.	6	5
I don't think you should work today.	6	5
I couldn't reach you. I assumed you weren't coming in.	6	5
My mother told me I should.	6	5
Well, mr. Cooper just announced that out of respect	6	5
We're going to close the office early.	6	5
- Oh. - That's probably a good idea.	6	5
- Mr. Sterling still wants to have the 3:00 meeting. - Are we closed or not?	6	5
Stan and ginsberg will also be joining. Do you want to cancel it?	6	5
- If you're gonna stay, I'll stay. - No, you go.	6	5
I'd really rather be here today.	6	5
Okay.	6	5
We're all so sorry.	6	5
Do you want anything?	6	5
No.	6	5
( phone rings )	6	5
- Hello? - Peggy olson, please.	6	5
- This is peggy. - Oh.	6	5
I was about to send over your offer and it occurred to me--	6	5
Oh, my offer. I completely forgot about that.	6	5
- You haven't sent it? - No, I haven't.	6	5
Well, no one's gonna want to look at that today.	6	5
May I speak?	6	5
I thought the same thing, but then I realized	6	5
There's trouble 10 blocks away.	6	5
They're probably on pins and needles.	6	5
So am I. Do I want to live up there?	6	5
Get ahold of yourself. The other buyer never came in.	6	5
Why don't we come in at 5,000 under asking	6	5
And give them 24 hours to respond?	6	5
We'll let the tv news do the rest.	6	5
- I don't know. - This is the only apartment for you.	6	5
You don't want to be kicking yourself next week.	6	5
And, of course, I'll wait until tomorrow to present.	6	5
Good girl.	6	5
Randall walsh, you remember don.	6	5
This is stan rizzo and michael ginsberg.	6	5
Randall, would you like a drink?	6	5
Never. I really don't even want to talk.	6	5
I was trying to communicate without words, but it's not working.	6	5
Randy, it never works.	6	5
Randall has an idea and the ad director won't take a chance.	6	5
You're in the property insurance business.	6	5
I'll bet you're about to get hit pretty hard.	6	5
Forget about that.	6	5
This is about a no bull_ó_ approach	6	5
To why I got into this business.	6	5
People say they care.	6	5
I really care.	6	5
We're waiting for you, randall.	6	5
All I see when I close my eyes	6	5
Is our name and a molotov cocktail	6	5
Being lit with a match.	6	5
And then a coupon at the bottom.	6	5
The ad sales guy didn't like that?	6	5
I know what it looks like-- fearmongering.	6	5
But this is the opposite.	6	5
This is a coded message that came to me	6	5
When I was visited by the spirit	6	5
Of dr. King last night.	6	5
He said that I should question the whole property thing, man.	6	5
It makes you happy, right?	6	5
( stifled laugh )	6	5
No, I think it was	6	5
His end will always be in poor taste.	6	5
'cause you'd rather not think about it.	6	5
But there is a tear, and in that tear	6	5
Are all the tears in the world,	6	5
All the animals crying.	6	5
You're right-- I don't want to think about it.	6	5
What don's saying is despite what we believe	6	5
To be good intentions,	6	5
You're allowing the emotions of the day,	6	5
And whatever else you got in your system, to influence your judgment.	6	5
Are you forgetting what tecumseh said?	6	5
Heya howa howa hoya.	6	5
- Heya howa howa. - I had forgotten that.	6	5
We'll think about it.	6	5
This is an opportunity.	6	5
The heavens are telling us to change.	6	5
You talked to dr. King's ghost?	6	5
Make sure randy doesn't get lost.	6	5
- I had to wait around for that? - I don't know.	6	5
He was very emotional. He talked me off a roof once.	6	5
I kind of owed him. You want a drink?	6	5
I just want to go home.	6	5
Someone's gonna do that idea, you know.	6	5
Not us.	6	5
Reporter: Three deaths have been reported	6	5
In the washington rioting so far.	6	5
There are no details yet on the circumstances surrounding them.	6	5
More than 350 persons have been treated for injuries.	6	5
- Among them, several policemen and firemen. - ( phone ringing )	6	5
Firefighting was hampered if for no other reason	6	5
By the sheer volume of the alarms.	6	5
But still, some persons were injured and...	6	5
Megan: It's betty. You're supposed to pick up the kids.	6	5
Oh, s_ó_.	6	5
Got it. Hello.	6	5
I knew you would forget.	6	5
You really want them down here?	6	5
I know you don't. You get out of every opportunity to see them.	6	5
You don't even know how strange they're acting.	6	5
The news is very upsetting.	6	5
I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact	6	5
That their father forgot about them.	6	5
You want me to come up there and get them,	6	5
Drive right through everything after dark?	6	5
Well, of course, henry thinks it's fine,	6	5
But he's not as concerned about their safety as you are.	6	5
Well, henry would know.	6	5
I guarantee you'd go to canada on your knees	6	5
To pick up your girlfriend.	6	5
I don't believe this.	6	5
I'm going to get the kids.	6	5
...Relatively little interference during the afternoon.	6	5
Really?	6	5
They called in the troops in washington,	6	5
But henry says we're fine here.	6	5
She's a piece of work.	6	5
Looting spread to the downtown shopping section of the city	6	5
And as darkness fell, arrests increased.	6	5
( sirens wailing )	6	5
You finished with that? You can walk me to work.	6	5
I'm already at work.	6	5
Since when are you going in on Saturday?	6	5
Since I don't want to be in front of the tv set.	6	5
Good as new.	6	5
This?	6	5
This is a mess.	6	5
You can't sew, you can't cook, you can't clean.	6	5
You don't think there's a reason you have all these flaws?	6	5
You need a girl.	6	5
But maybe you don't like 'em.	6	5
I like girls, dad.	6	5
If that was true, you'd be in bed with her right now.	6	5
I don't think anybody's in the mood.	6	5
It's quite the opposite.	6	5
Now's the time when a man and a woman	6	5
Need to be together the most.	6	5
In a catastrophe.	6	5
In the flood, the animals went two by two.	6	5
You, you're gonna get on the ark with your father.	6	5
I can find my own girls, okay?	6	5
Okay.	6	5
I'll bring you a sandwich.	6	5
( tv playing )	6	5
( sighs )	6	5
I'm glad you finally slept.	6	5
What's going on?	6	5
We're going to a vigil in the park.	6	5
- You're not supposed to be watching tv. - I'm not.	6	5
You are, and mom said you can't.	6	5
Sally, stop it.	6	5
Troy and bridget called. They're gonna meet us there.	6	5
We'll be back in a couple of hours.	6	5
I don't feel well.	6	5
You go on ahead. I'll watch him.	6	5
Come on.	6	5
Look, I just can't sit around in the apartment anymore.	6	5
I feel like I have to do something.	6	5
I understand.	6	5
I knew you wouldn't go.	6	5
You want some aspirin?	6	5
Hey. Turn it off.	6	5
( tv turns off )	6	5
Tell me exactly what your mother said.	6	5
I'm not allowed to watch tv for a week.	6	5
Dr. Zaius: Man has no understanding.	6	5
He can be taught a few simple tricks, nothing more.	6	5
Dr. Zira: I'm afraid I must disagree.	6	5
According to my experiments--	6	5
Dr. Zira, I must caution you.	6	5
I guess your stomach is feeling better.	6	5
Why are you being punished?	6	5
I don't know.	6	5
Come on.	6	5
Because the wallpaper didn't line up.	6	5
...The simian nature from a study of man	6	5
Is sheer nonsense,	6	5
Because man is a nuisance.	6	5
He eats up his food supplies in the forest...	6	5
You maniacs!	6	5
You blew it up!	6	5
Oh, damn you!	6	5
God d_ó_ you all to hell!	6	5
The humans blew up new york?	6	5
All of america.	6	5
So he came back to here?	6	5
In the future.	6	5
Jesus.	6	5
You want to see it again?	6	5
Can we?	6	5
- ( typewriter clacking ) - ( phone ringing )	6	5
I need another half hour.	6	5
Oh, yeah. Just a minute.	6	5
It's for you. It's the real estate agent.	6	5
- Hello, ginny. - Well, we didn't get it.	6	5
Wh-- what happened?	6	5
Someone came in a little bit higher.	6	5
But you know what? It wasn't meant to be.	6	5
( sighs ) how much higher?	6	5
It was still under asking, peggy. It wasn't meant to be.	6	5
There's no other way to think about it. Try, try again.	6	5
( hangs up )	6	5
Someone else got the apartment.	6	5
What are you gonna do?	6	5
- That's it? - What do you want me to say?	6	5
That you give a damn.	6	5
Peggy, this is an emotional story.	6	5
Stop being such a martyr. You're having the time of your life.	6	5
- Why are you so mad? - Because I'm alone in this.	6	5
That's not cool.	6	5
I don't mean financially.	6	5
I mean, don't you care where we live?	6	5
Look, I don't feel right expressing an opinion.	6	5
Now is your chance.	6	5
I don't want to live on the upper east side.	6	5
Fine. Why?	6	5
I don't know.	6	5
I saw us raising our kids in a place	6	5
With more different kinds of people.	6	5
This photographer trailing me the other night,	6	5
He lives in the west 80s.	6	5
Isn't it dangerous?	6	5
No, it's more rundown.	6	5
But that's why it's so cheap.	6	5
Get some lumber, a coat of paint-- people are doing it.	6	5
I didn't know you felt that way.	6	5
About the upper east side.	6	5
I do.	6	5
I'm sorry.	6	5
I just felt it wasn't my money.	6	5
How much of a say do I have?	6	5
You're in my life.	6	5
You're a part of my life.	6	5
Peggy, I've got to finish this.	6	5
( typewriter clacking )	6	5
- Did you see this movie? - Not yet.	6	5
Do you get to see it for free?	6	5
- I do. - It's really good.	6	5
- We're seeing it again. - You enjoy yourself.	6	5
Everybody likes to go to the movies when they're sad.	6	5
I was looking for you. You left the tv on.	6	5
I don't feel right turning it off,	6	5
But I don't want to watch it.	6	5
He doesn't even want me to come in.	6	5
Everything has settled down.	6	5
For the time being.	6	5
No, I think this is the end of it.	6	5
Good.	6	5
Betty, I hope you know you'll never have to worry about money.	6	5
Why would you bring that up?	6	5
Nothing.	6	5
I just keep asking myself,	6	5
"- ""what am I doing?"" - about what?"	6	5
I keep thinking about walking through harlem,	6	5
Lindsay a few paces ahead, grinning like he always does,	6	5
The rest of us following behind.	6	5
- Wasn't that frightening? - It was exhilarating.	6	5
But what was the cost of avoiding that riot?	6	5
Police corruption, disrespect for authority,	6	5
Negotiating with hoodlums.	6	5
You can't say that to the mayor.	6	5
He's never been more popular.	6	5
It's just, betty,	6	5
I keep thinking I would do it differently.	6	5
I want to do it differently.	6	5
And, well, they approached me	6	5
Like they always do when somebody dies	6	5
And they offered me a seat in the state senate.	6	5
Do you want to run?	6	5
Run? It's a republican seat.	6	5
It's basically unopposed.	6	5
- You'd have to quit the mayor's office. - He'll understand.	6	5
You think I'm the first guy sick of being in a flank?	6	5
I feel like I've been asking you to do this since I met you.	6	5
Well, I finally heard you.	6	5
It's a stepping stone to state attorney general.	6	5
- And-- - and who knows what else?	6	5
Easy, partner.	6	5
This is what I've wanted for you.	6	5
Us.	6	5
I can't wait for people to meet you.	6	5
You know? Really meet you.	6	5
Everyone's in bed.	6	5
Gene finally climbed in with sally.	6	5
( sighs )	6	5
I felt better, but now I don't.	6	5
- Why? - Because who knows what you're feeling?	6	5
I didn't know what to say to her	6	5
"Except, ""I'd tell you to ask your father,"	6	5
"But he's at the movies."""	6	5
"I should have said, ""he's just drunk."""	6	5
You're better with them.	6	5
You don't understand.	6	5
I do.	6	5
You don't have marx, you've got a bottle.	6	5
Is this what you really want to be to them	6	5
When they need you?	6	5
No.	6	5
( sighs )	6	5
I don't think I ever wanted to be the man who loves children.	6	5
But from the moment they're born...	6	5
That baby comes out	6	5
And you act proud and excited	6	5
And hand out cigars...	6	5
But you don't feel anything.	6	5
Especially if you had a difficult childhood.	6	5
You want to love them, but you don't.	6	5
And the fact that you're...	6	5
Faking that feeling	6	5
Makes you wonder	6	5
If your own father had the same problem.	6	5
Then one day they get older...	6	5
And you see them do something...	6	5
And you feel...	6	5
That feeling	6	5
That you were pretending to have.	6	5
And it feels like your heart is going to explode.	6	5
That was faster than I expected.	6	5
Are things calmer out there?	6	5
Well, then...	6	5
Have a good night.	6	5
Hey.	6	5
- You need to go to sleep. - I can't.	6	5
So why can't you sleep?	6	5
I'm scared.	6	5
Don't make me sorry for taking you to the movies.	6	5
No.	6	5
I just keep thinking...	6	5
What if somebody shoots henry?	6	5
No one's gonna do that.	6	5
- But they could. - But they won't.	6	5
Henry's not that important.	6	5
Go to sleep.	6	5
( sirens wailing )	6	5
"""love is blue"" playing"	6	5
Previously on Mad Men...	6	6
He is not your friend, he is the enemy.	6	6
You let Don talk, you should know better.	6	6
The guy's not a salesman.	6	6
- Why do we care what that guy wants? - Because he's a client.	6	6
I don't want to live on the Upper East side.	6	6
I saw us raising our kids in a place with more different kinds of people.	6	6
I don't know what to say.	6	6
Say you're gonna be the first American to complete a successful heart transplant.	6	6
I could come up and stay there tonight, if you want.	6	6
We'll be fine.	6	6
 Are you sure you don't want me to order in some food?	6	6
- Chinese? - I'm sorry this is taking so long.	6	6
It's a common mistake to not ask questions	6	6
when you want something because you're afraid of the answers.	6	6
So you want something?	6	6
I'm interested.	6	6
And considering the precedent for small agencies,	6	6
this is how we might take you public.	6	6
With one and a half million shares outstanding	6	6
before the offering, we'd sell 400,000 additional shares	6	6
to the public at $9 a share.	6	6
- 12 a share. - It's not an insult.	6	6
Our valuation of your company was made after careful analysis.	6	6
Of papers you spent 20 minutes with?	6	6
 I can't take this to the rest of my partners,	6	6
but I can take it to other underwriters.	6	6
I'll need these documents for 24 hours.	6	6
These papers are spotless. My compliments to the chef.	6	6
Shall we?	6	6
You don't think Cooper pushed that poor banker too hard, do you?	6	6
We don't want to lose him.	6	6
Certainly not.	6	6
It's a marvel.	6	6
Everyone wants you, don't they?	6	6
Pete, no.	6	6
No, I believe our primary hurdle has been cleared.	6	6
And our secondary one?	6	6
Don't worry about Don. Even at nine a share,	6	6
your part of the company alone will be worth nearly $1 million.	6	6
My goodness.	6	6
You're flushed.	6	6
I drank too fast.	6	6
I don't think Don cares about money.	6	6
That may be true. God bless him.	6	6
But he's tired of playing in the bush leagues.	6	6
This capitalization will double our size	6	6
and that will turn his head.	6	6
You want another?	6	6
No. I can hardly walk and you know it.	6	6
I hope Clara reminded you tomorrow's Mother's Day.	6	6
Thank you, I'm aware.	6	6
Ow.	6	6
Just wanted to make sure you were still here.	6	6
I am, but not for long.	6	6
You don't even know what time it is.	6	6
I do.	6	6
Because I already got up and put on my face.	6	6
Is that what you do?	6	6
- I wondered. - I have to go.	6	6
Daisy, you're a tease.	6	6
What more could I give you?	6	6
Look, the first-class lounge would be a darker place without you,	6	6
but you're supposed to have your ear to the ground.	6	6
I feel like you only call me when you want to see me.	6	6
Am I going to see you tomorrow?	6	6
If there's a flight filled with P&G executives headed back to Cincinnati.	6	6
- How about tonight? - I have plans.	6	6
Some other boyfriend? The one you give all the leads to?	6	6
With my mother.	6	6
It's Mother's Day.	6	6
Don't go.	6	6
I have to.	6	6
But my mother just died.	6	6
What are you doing?	6	6
You told me you wanted me here Sunday morning.	6	6
I'm here.	6	6
Peter, don't.	6	6
So we'll just maintain every other aspect of this marriage	6	6
except the one that matters.	6	6
You mean Tammy?	6	6
Will you stop holding the axe over my neck?	6	6
So you'd rather I divorce you just so you know where things stand?	6	6
You don't care that I want you.	6	6
I've taken note of your efforts.	6	6
I'm going to get her.	6	6
Well...	6	6
you're gonna be sorry when this is over.	6	6
You've given up on me at exactly the wrong time.	6	6
I have big things coming.	6	6
You have no idea.	6	6
Well, I'll take note of that, too.	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
Could you get that?	6	6
- Arnold. Come in. - Hi.	6	6
I'm sorry to bother you. Do you have any wrapping paper?	6	6
It's an emergency.	6	6
Good morning.	6	6
Sorry, this is Megan's mother Marie.	6	6
We passed in the lobby. I thought you were Megan.	6	6
Dr. Arnold Rosen at your service.	6	6
- Enchanté. - Are you French?	6	6
My kid's going to Paris. Should I keep him home?	6	6
I am French, but I live in Montreal.	6	6
And, yes, I believe so.	6	6
I assume this isn't a medical emergency.	6	6
Mitchell-- that's my son--	6	6
he came home and surprised her for Mother's Day.	6	6
- How long is he staying? - Who knows?	6	6
I know he thinks a morning stroll in Central Park is a gift,	6	6
but Sylvia's gonna expect an actual gift.	6	6
Do you want my flowers? I'm quite done with them.	6	6
Thank you, Mother.	6	6
You're a lifesaver.	6	6
He's a surgeon. He's working on heart transplants.	6	6
Wealthy, talented, handsome--	6	6
I would not leave them alone.	6	6
I'm more worried about you.	6	6
There's poop on the stairs again.	6	6
Somebody's dog got in.	6	6
No, it's human.	6	6
I think it's from the tenant.	6	6
She wouldn't do that.	6	6
She's a junkie. She doesn't care.	6	6
I want her out.	6	6
We can't do that.	6	6
How is your mother?	6	6
I got curtains. She wants to come visit.	6	6
Ah! Ow! Ow.	6	6
Jesus.	6	6
We have to hire a handyman.	6	6
Why? It's a waste of money.	6	6
Because you have no idea what you're doing.	6	6
Herb Rennet called. He's canceling dinner tonight.	6	6
That's a relief.	6	6
We can still have dinner.	6	6
I'd love to discuss some things with you.	6	6
Let's enjoy our reprieve.	6	6
Of course.	6	6
Psst. Close the door.	6	6
Did he say your dinner with Jaguar is off?	6	6
Yes, unless it was the world's most boring dream.	6	6
Well, it's on, but Pete's not invited.	6	6
Herb Rennet wants a word alone to straighten things out.	6	6
Why can't you handle it?	6	6
This could be fatal. You're going.	6	6
And my plan is to pack it with spouses to limit the explosion.	6	6
Megan made plans with her mother.	6	6
She thought I had a business dinner.	6	6
Marie's in town? Fantastic.	6	6
Bring her along. That's perfect.	6	6
Tell her I insisted.	6	6
In attendance I have Jim Cutler,	6	6
Frank Gleason, and Ted Chaough.	6	6
Sweetheart, this is a creative meeting. What are you doing?	6	6
It's for the purposes of the memorandum.	6	6
Well, Ted, some men love women, some love memos.	6	6
I want to go over where we are on Chevrolet again	6	6
and devote our final days to overdoing it	6	6
on the artwork for the top three campaigns.	6	6
I cannot look at these again.	6	6
I told you, they're very keen on the rocket ship thing	6	6
with the astronaut anecdotes.	6	6
You told them about the astronauts?	6	6
I had to. It was too vague otherwise.	6	6
I don't want to draw any more rockets	6	6
and I don't want to stare at this work again.	6	6
We should have never resigned Alfa Romeo.	6	6
"What, is this mystery Chevy gonna be in ""The Graduate""?"	6	6
Those things are flying off the lot.	6	6
Frank, are you not on board with this?	6	6
I love what you're doing.	6	6
I'm tired of rockets, that's all.	6	6
Could you give us a moment? We'll continue this later.	6	6
What is that, Shalimar?	6	6
What's gotten into you?	6	6
You're supposed to be calming me down.	6	6
Ted, I've got cancer.	6	6
What?	6	6
In my pancreas.	6	6
I told Jim. I thought he told you	6	6
and you didn't want to embarrass me.	6	6
No.	6	6
Maybe it's more of a financial issue to him,	6	6
but I'm glad he can keep a secret.	6	6
Financial?	6	6
The minute I cash out, I cash in.	6	6
You two have to buy me out.	6	6
You have cancer.	6	6
See, if we still had Alfa, I wouldn't have to worry	6	6
about putting you out of business.	6	6
First of all,	6	6
stop talking about money.	6	6
Second, we are going to get Chevy	6	6
because you're going to do your best work.	6	6
Third, you're going to build a wing	6	6
at Sloan-Kettering and beat this thing.	6	6
Aye, aye.	6	6
Will you tell Jim you told me?	6	6
He'll see it on your face.	6	6
Everybody loves astronauts.	6	6
I've got to go lie down.	6	6
Well, hello there.	6	6
How are things in Glocca Morra?	6	6
Hello. Can you hear me?	6	6
I love it when you whisper like that. What are you wearing?	6	6
My uniform.	6	6
I have one and his flight's delayed.	6	6
Who is he? What's he do?	6	6
I'm not sure,	6	6
but he doesn't believe my name's really Daisy.	6	6
Use that.	6	6
Shit.	6	6
Do you mind?	6	6
17, please.	6	6
I'm sorry to bother you, but we love your show.	6	6
Oh, thank you.	6	6
Can we get an autograph?	6	6
I know you're not waving to me.	6	6
Makes the delay worthwhile, doesn't it?	6	6
- Headed to Detroit? - Eventually.	6	6
Should we try LaGuardia?	6	6
They already did. Forget it.	6	6
This is why I like to drive everywhere.	6	6
I'd live in my car if I could.	6	6
You know, with her in the backseat navigating.	6	6
I'm Roger.	6	6
- What's your name? - Mikey.	6	6
Well, Mikey, since we're gonna be cell mates,	6	6
I'm going to ask the screw for a couple of drinks.	6	6
Jim Beam.	6	6
I'll make her bring them over.	6	6
- Good idea. - I'm full of 'em.	6	6
I want a glass of water with an onion	6	6
and bring him a double Jim Beam.	6	6
And get me on that flight.	6	6
_	6	6
This is my day off. We had plans.	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
Well, you would rather spend the evening laughing at Roger Sterling's jokes.	6	6
I should return home. I've overstayed my welcome.	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
Well, I don't know what's happened.	6	6
I knew something was wrong.	6	6
We have not had a fight.	6	6
He's so far away	6	6
that sometimes when we're alone,	6	6
I feel like I'm making conversation.	6	6
Darling, you have confounded everyone's expectations.	6	6
And it is very hard to stand next to someone	6	6
giving an autograph.	6	6
- He doesn't even care. - Of course he does.	6	6
But he may think you belong more to other people than to him.	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
I love coming into the city.	6	6
It's 25 minutes, half hour give or take,	6	6
from Tenafly depending on the traffic.	6	6
I always think I'm gonna go to museums and stuff.	6	6
And there's some good ones. You've probably seen them.	6	6
But I always end up at Saks.	6	6
And I come home	6	6
and Herb always says the same thing.	6	6
How much damage did you do, Peaches?	6	6
We always do some shopping.	6	6
My daughter is very generous.	6	6
She even invited me along to this wonderful evening.	6	6
You get a hold of Silver Bells?	6	6
No. That doesn't mean he's not coming.	6	6
I'm pretty much done waiting.	6	6
Perhaps we should go.	6	6
What?	6	6
No, I think we're gonna order now.	6	6
Herb gets very peckish.	6	6
I skipped lunch.	6	6
Can I help you, Bert?	6	6
You've already done all you can do.	6	6
Snapped this place into shape,	6	6
expanded our business while keeping it lean.	6	6
Pending due diligence, we're done...	6	6
at $11 a share.	6	6
Really?	6	6
I believe I would like a drink.	6	6
What do you drink?	6	6
Do you have any brandy?	6	6
No.	6	6
Spirits of elderflower?	6	6
No. I don't have any laudanum either.	6	6
- Surprise me. - Night, chief.	6	6
Bob, could you get Joan?	6	6
- And some ice. - Absolutely.	6	6
When do we break the news?	6	6
Call the meeting for tomorrow.	6	6
Ahh.	6	6
So there she was in the garage	6	6
right among the-- you know, there's an oil stain	6	6
that Herb's been meaning to take care of--	6	6
there she is, our little puppy,	6	6
with a full litter.	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
_	6	6
You're right, Mother. They must have been adorable.	6	6
There's one yellow and one brown	6	6
and then three sort of mixed.	6	6
Each one at its own nipple.	6	6
I love puppies.	6	6
Not the way she does.	6	6
_	6	6
You know what? Why don't we let the men	6	6
discuss the business they're probably here to talk about	6	6
while we powder our noses?	6	6
Tall and tan and young and lovely.	6	6
So why are we here, Herb?	6	6
Oh, it's nothing serious. I just had an idea.	6	6
There's a kid who's been writing fliers for me	6	6
at a few of my lots	6	6
and I'm really getting results.	6	6
He's got a good turn of phrase.	6	6
I think you'd appreciate it.	6	6
Is he looking for a job?	6	6
No, he's got a job.	6	6
I just thought that it might help you and me	6	6
if he were to take a look at some of your work,	6	6
even at the formative stages,	6	6
just to get his take on it.	6	6
What's his name?	6	6
Fawcett.	6	6
Chris Fawcett.	6	6
Here you go.	6	6
- What is this? - It's the name of the guy	6	6
who's going to be handling your account from now on.	6	6
You never fail to overheat, do you?	6	6
You know the somersaults I'm doing 'cause you're so touchy?	6	6
Really? A man your size?	6	6
You know what?	6	6
Your whole company should be taken to the woodshed.	6	6
First Campbell gives me the sass.	6	6
Then Sterling, he didn't even show up.	6	6
And you-- huh, yeah-- my friend,	6	6
you're gonna be working for him.	6	6
And he could teach you something	6	6
like knowing where your bread is buttered.	6	6
Why don't you get this?	6	6
I want you to buy me one last meal.	6	6
I'm tired of taking it out of your account.	6	6
Okay.	6	6
And if you ever see Sterling again,	6	6
tell him you screwed up	6	6
'cause I'm done with all of youse.	6	6
Don't sit down. Dinner's over.	6	6
Are you okay?	6	6
Never felt better in my life.	6	6
Nice meeting you. See you soon.	6	6
My mother needs an aspirin.	6	6
I don't care.	6	6
- Hello? - Marie.	6	6
It's Roger. I'm so glad I got you.	6	6
If you are calling to apologize, don't bother.	6	6
- It's too late. Good night. - Hold on, hold on, don't hang up.	6	6
- Let me talk to Don. - Did you call to talk to Don?	6	6
Yes, but I was hoping you were there. You were next, I swear.	6	6
You dragged me out and made me sit	6	6
with that disgusting man with his disgusting wife.	6	6
She is the apple that goes in the pig's mouth.	6	6
Marie, I swear I wouldn't have missed it for the world.	6	6
It's just something came up,	6	6
something very important	6	6
that I need to talk to Don about.	6	6
You are speaking slowly so I will understand?	6	6
Forget... my... name.	6	6
Excuse me.	6	6
Is it possible for me to pay for my friend?	6	6
Yes, but it's too late for that.	6	6
What are you bugging him for?	6	6
Aren't I enough for you?	6	6
This is my friend. What was your fake name again?	6	6
Curious George?	6	6
You're a riot.	6	6
Hello.	6	6
Good night.	6	6
Isn't that guy a client?	6	6
Is he gone?	6	6
Yes.	6	6
I have a high-level accounts question.	6	6
A hypothetical.	6	6
So it doesn't involve anybody in this room?	6	6
Let's say you caught your father-in-law in a compromising position.	6	6
It's every Sunday night. The guy can't hold his liquor.	6	6
Last night I was celebrating at that party house up on Lex	6	6
and I saw my father-in-law exit the bedroom	6	6
with the biggest,	6	6
blackest prostitute you've ever seen.	6	6
Was there anyone else from Vicks there?	6	6
Not that I saw. But we spoke.	6	6
I mean, all I said was hello, but--	6	6
Okay, look, when I was in high school,	6	6
they had this picture come to the only movie theater in Cabot.	6	6
"It was called ""Making A Baby."""	6	6
They invited women and men separately,	6	6
but it was a delivery system for some filthy stuff.	6	6
So at the matinee, I look over	6	6
and Mr. Miller my science teacher is five seats away.	6	6
And he's not, you know, working the slide rule or anything,	6	6
but we see each other for sure.	6	6
But we both knew that neither of us should be there.	6	6
It was mutually assured destruction.	6	6
So he's not going to say anything?	6	6
He can't.	6	6
Mr. Cosgrove, I have a phone call.	6	6
Give me a second.	6	6
It's why I don't worry about the bomb.	6	6
It's urgent.	6	6
I have Hugh Hibbert and John Echolls from Jaguar.	6	6
Why are they calling you? Pick it up.	6	6
This is Ken.	6	6
Good morning.	6	6
Do you have any idea where Roger has been for the last 24 hours?	6	6
- I don't. - Draper!	6	6
What in the hell have you--	6	6
- What? - You have done it again.	6	6
What did you say to Herb Rennet last night?	6	6
Nothing that shouldn't have been said last Christmas.	6	6
As usual, you have acted impulsively	6	6
and harmed the company irreparably.	6	6
- Pete, calm down. - We'd already lost the account.	6	6
He was gonna bring in some kid to write copy.	6	6
That's because you screwed him last time.	6	6
You couldn't wait.	6	6
Pete, you've got to understand when it's over.	6	6
Do you know that we had a public offering underway?	6	6
And now it's ruined!	6	6
- What? - You don't care about the company.	6	6
- You're already rich. - Not here.	6	6
Inside.	6	6
- What is going on? - Why the hell didn't I know about this?	6	6
- We're going public? - Not anymore.	6	6
- When did that happen? - I was going to tell you this morning.	6	6
I tried to last night, but you'd rather have dinner with Herb Rennet.	6	6
Well, I have some good news and some bad news.	6	6
- Where the hell have you been? - Don fired Jaguar.	6	6
What?	6	6
Then I just have good news. We're giving a presentation	6	6
this Friday on Chevy's top secret new car.	6	6
- What? - Friday?	6	6
Come on, you've been thinking about Chevy your whole life.	6	6
- Are you serious? - And I have this check for $10,000	6	6
because I close, Pete. I close things.	6	6
Did I mention I was in Detroit	6	6
where my friend Mikey O'Brien-- look him up--	6	6
said he was looking for something cutting-edge,	6	6
but none of the agencies had it?	6	6
So he had a great idea. Bring us in.	6	6
We're not afraid of a deadline.	6	6
Holy crap. Chevy.	6	6
You want to go public?	6	6
How much better is it when we have Chevy?	6	6
Don't act like you had a plan.	6	6
You're Tarzan swinging from vine to vine.	6	6
Roger, I want to know everything. Pete, go box up Jaguar.	6	6
Make sure they have all their files today.	6	6
Joan, get the creatives in my office.	6	6
Get them yourself.	6	6
Don't you feel 300 pounds lighter?	6	6
I don't.	6	6
Honestly, Don, if I could deal with him, you could deal with him.	6	6
And what now?	6	6
I went through all of that for nothing?	6	6
Joan, don't worry. I will win this.	6	6
Just once	6	6
"I would like to hear you use the word ""we."""	6	6
Because we're all rooting for you from the sidelines,	6	6
hoping that you'll decide whatever you think is right for our lives.	6	6
In my office, all of you.	6	6
Should we go in there?	6	6
I don't care.	6	6
XP-887.	6	6
- So we get to name it? - Possibly.	6	6
For now it's all cloak-and-dagger.	6	6
They've got a room full of R&D on this.	6	6
But it boils down to Chevrolet's top brass	6	6
trying to build the perfect car.	6	6
- They designed it with a computer. - So they're scared.	6	6
They run another agency in at the one-yard line.	6	6
They're terrified.	6	6
So who else is in it?	6	6
Well, the guest list limping in	6	6
is as follows-- Campbell-Ewald.	6	6
Chevy's right arm. They got 200 people in Detroit.	6	6
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample	6	6
and Cutler Gleason and Chaough.	6	6
Ha, fantastic. Two steamships and a rowboat.	6	6
You had to write that down?	6	6
- There's no pictures. - It's a GM car.	6	6
It's got four wheels and an engine.	6	6
No, it's totally new.	6	6
I want you to go to the library	6	6
and get me everything you can on Mustang.	6	6
- And Chevy. - No, forget that.	6	6
They know there's been nothing before Mustang	6	6
and nothing after it, but they're hoping it's this.	6	6
No one and nothing leaves my office.	6	6
How about that?	6	6
How 'bout it?	6	6
Are you okay?	6	6
"I just wanted to watch ""Hazel,"""	6	6
but I can't get any reception.	6	6
I think you should go home.	6	6
I love how you work every account like it's make or break.	6	6
I need some of that right now.	6	6
You've been working plenty.	6	6
I have a new way to go.	6	6
I'd show it to you, but it's top secret and it may be terrible.	6	6
Maybe Frank's right.	6	6
We should have never dumped Alfa.	6	6
It's one thing to want something, it's another to need it.	6	6
This is your agency.	6	6
You're always going to need something.	6	6
Don't let Frank Gleason make you question it.	6	6
Well, it's Frank's agency, too, Peggy.	6	6
And I've been counting on his paintbrush and his negativity	6	6
to balance me out for 20 years.	6	6
Fine.	6	6
But I've spent a lot of time	6	6
working with pessimistic people	6	6
and I like the fact that you're--	6	6
Do not say I'm nice.	6	6
I hate it when people say I'm nice.	6	6
I was going to say strong.	6	6
I'm sorry.	6	6
I'm just grateful.	6	6
No, of course.	6	6
Good night, Peggy.	6	6
Yes.	6	6
Good night.	6	6
Hold that.	6	6
I got it.	6	6
You want to go celebrate? I just quit my job.	6	6
What? Really?	6	6
I had a heart and a kid who needed the heart	6	6
and now they're both dead.	6	6
I'm not gonna get the opportunity.	6	6
I'm tired of fighting.	6	6
Well, you're fighting God in a way.	6	6
Oh, bullshit.	6	6
You don't think God's in Houston?	6	6
My hospital chickened out	6	6
and now some asshole down there is taking my place	6	6
in history while I piss away my life in New York City.	6	6
You can't think that way.	6	6
Fate hasn't chosen me.	6	6
Look...	6	6
I don't cut people open. I don't believe in fate.	6	6
You make your own opportunities.	6	6
You sure you don't want to go for a drink?	6	6
I got work.	6	6
- How'd it go? - I don't know.	6	6
I was gonna sleep on it,	6	6
but now I think I'm just gonna shower and go back in.	6	6
I love you like this.	6	6
Desperate and scared?	6	6
Fearless.	6	6
And I want to do whatever I can	6	6
to make sure you do not fail.	6	6
Then you can jump from the balcony	6	6
and fly to work like Superman.	6	6
Will there be anything else?	6	6
No, thank you, Daisy.	6	6
Actually, can you get those lugs	6	6
from Dancer bumped off the flight?	6	6
Roger, I told you, I can't hurt the company.	6	6
They bought most of the seats.	6	6
Jesus, there's like eight of them.	6	6
Surprised to see you here.	6	6
Taking your kid to look at colleges?	6	6
No, taking him to pick out a car.	6	6
Oh. When did they add you guys to the mix?	6	6
When they saw your work.	6	6
I wish you the best of luck.	6	6
In fact, maybe we shouldn't even go.	6	6
What are the billings for Vicks?	6	6
Nine million? Someone's gonna pick that up.	6	6
Any of you have a cough drop?	6	6
I know they don't.	6	6
Get him on the phone right now or I'm coming over there.	6	6
I've got it, Clara.	6	6
Roger's calling from the airport.	6	6
He says something happened with Vick Chemical.	6	6
Tell my father-in-law I am not joking.	6	6
Believe me, you do not want me in your lobby.	6	6
Let me talk to Roger.	6	6
So it's true?	6	6
No, I'm gonna fix it.	6	6
Jesus, they don't need to hear this right now.	6	6
Roger will handle it.	6	6
- Well? - They're screwing with us.	6	6
Really?	6	6
Daisy's gonna lose their luggage.	6	6
Well, apparently you didn't get any of my calls.	6	6
So I came down here to your lair.	6	6
Spare me the outrage, Pete.	6	6
I'm tired of it.	6	6
Tom, what are you doing?	6	6
I know we're both emotional and vulnerable,	6	6
but I'm not the enemy here.	6	6
I'm an adult, as are you.	6	6
And if anything, our relationship	6	6
has shown over the last seven years	6	6
that I have a very short memory.	6	6
Now, what can I do	6	6
to bring you back to reality	6	6
in this obviously impulsive decision?	6	6
My daughter is a princess.	6	6
She could have had anyone.	6	6
I knew there was a reason you never wanted children.	6	6
You have no business being a father.	6	6
You just pressed the button, Tom.	6	6
You just blew everything up.	6	6
Well, it makes me sick thinking about the man I saw	6	6
being with my daughter and my granddaughter.	6	6
Why don't you look in the mirror?	6	6
You can walk out like a man	6	6
or I can have you thrown out like the lowlife you are.	6	6
If I have as low character as you say,	6	6
why would you push me like this?	6	6
You'll do the right thing.	6	6
The paint fumes are making me sick.	6	6
I got the windows open.	6	6
It'll be dry in a couple of days.	6	6
And when am I gonna be able to walk around	6	6
my apartment in bare feet?	6	6
Soon. We're fixing it up.	6	6
In here, yes. But out there?	6	6
Those kids are living on our stoop	6	6
lighting firecrackers and playing their music.	6	6
And you keep waving to them.	6	6
Look, the neighborhood is changing.	6	6
We're a part of that.	6	6
I don't like change.	6	6
I want everything to stay the way it was.	6	6
I don't think you understand, babe.	6	6
Everything's getting better. Johnson's gone.	6	6
The war is gonna end.	6	6
We're gonna have a new president no matter what.	6	6
Maybe McCarthy. Worst case, Kennedy.	6	6
I love Bobby Kennedy.	6	6
Fine.	6	6
If that's what you want.	6	6
I just want you to kiss me.	6	6
Damn it.	6	6
Hello to you, too.	6	6
What the hell are you doing in Detroit?	6	6
My doctor recommended an ocean voyage.	6	6
Can I get one of those?	6	6
I don't believe this.	6	6
I spent six weeks on this pipe dream	6	6
and it's gonna be over in two seconds.	6	6
Hell, I knew I was good,	6	6
but I didn't know all I had to do was show up.	6	6
You don't know what this means?	6	6
It's not my job to put you at ease,	6	6
but just because they brought us in	6	6
at the last second doesn't mean you're dead.	6	6
Me? We're both dead.	6	6
I've had enough psychological warfare today.	6	6
- Why don't you take a table? - Think about it.	6	6
When it's two top 10 agencies and me, I've got a chance.	6	6
Now that there's two little guys, we're DOA.	6	6
I'm not worried. I've got great work.	6	6
Of course you do. And mine's even better, I guarantee.	6	6
You know how this works. They're gonna take our creative	6	6
and give it to one of the big boys.	6	6
Second place, tied with last.	6	6
Come on, you know I'm right.	6	6
So they want a name brand.	6	6
- We had a car. - So did we.	6	6
It's not the same thing.	6	6
It's the size of the team.	6	6
It's opening an office in Detroit.	6	6
This is General Motors.	6	6
They fight the war with bodies on the ground.	6	6
I saw Dancer at the airport.	6	6
Looked like half my office.	6	6
This business is rigged.	6	6
Damn it.	6	6
That's what I said.	6	6
Sorry about that.	6	6
I'm tired of this crap.	6	6
I should just let Chevy buy my brain and put it in a jar.	6	6
Can I get another?	6	6
Brain in a jar.	6	6
Put it on your tombstone.	6	6
"""Here lies SCDP,"	6	6
"the little company with the big ideas."""	6	6
"""CGC, giving away creative one car at a time."""	6	6
So what did you go with?	6	6
What, I show you mine, you show me yours?	6	6
What's the difference at this point?	6	6
You first.	6	6
Okay, but I've got to stand up.	6	6
This is a car for the young and the young at heart.	6	6
Because today nobody knows where they're headed,	6	6
but they're not afraid of what's around the bend.	6	6
Power plus design equals adventure.	6	6
Throw the map out the window and hit the road, Jack.	6	6
Then I sing the song.	6	6
- That's good. - No kidding.	6	6
Just music. People's faces.	6	6
All kinds-- teenagers, dads, moms.	6	6
Different expressions of wonder.	6	6
What could this possibly be?	6	6
It's so new,	6	6
this combination of power,	6	6
technology, comfort, and price	6	6
that it's impossible to imagine.	6	6
But not at Chevy.	6	6
The future	6	6
is something you haven't even thought of yet.	6	6
You run that for a week,	6	6
then you finally show the car.	6	6
That's interesting.	6	6
Hooray.	6	6
So should we go home?	6	6
We--	6	6
that's interesting.	6	6
Why, you want to stay just so Chevy	6	6
can put a feather in your cap?	6	6
I have a better idea.	6	6
No, you don't. I just heard it.	6	6
This is why everyone hates you.	6	6
Think about it.	6	6
Both of us have the creative,	6	6
but neither of us have an agency to match.	6	6
Why would I do that?	6	6
Because we're dead.	6	6
Even if I were to consider that, Chevy calls the shots.	6	6
Hey, Lieutenant,	6	6
want to get into some trouble?	6	6
How would that even work?	6	6
Well, one of us, probably me,	6	6
will have to figure out a way to make Chevy	6	6
think it was their idea to combine our agencies.	6	6
And then the other one, let's say it was you,	6	6
will have to figure out what the hell we're going to present.	6	6
Well, we have partners.	6	6
Who aren't sitting in this bar.	6	6
Can I get another?	6	6
No, we're done.	6	6
We've got a long night.	6	6

I want to make it clear,	6	6
unless this works, I'm against it.	6	6
I was just saying the same thing.	6	6
Shall we?	6	6
After you.	6	6
You're not supposed to be here till the weekend.	6	6
I don't like you surprising me.	6	6
Sit down, Trudy.	6	6
Did you know your father pulled his business?	6	6
No.	6	6
And I don't care, Peter.	6	6
You understand that we were going to be very rich,	6	6
but he's ruined that.	6	6
He's done everything for you.	6	6
He's a hypocrite, Trudy.	6	6
Don't you dare criticize my father.	6	6
I guess it doesn't matter	6	6
that I caught him in a Midtown whorehouse.	6	6
Just stop it right now.	6	6
It's true. With a 200-pound Negro prostitute.	6	6
Ask him to his face.	6	6
You'll say anything to hurt me, won't you?	6	6
He wanted it this way.	6	6
He left me no other choice.	6	6
You had lots of choices, Peter.	6	6
We're done. Get your things.	6	6
Mr. Chaough wants to see you.	6	6
- He's back? - That's all I know.	6	6
So, how'd it go?	6	6
We got it. We won Chevy.	6	6
What are you doing here?	6	6
We went in together.	6	6
What?	6	6
What are you talking about?	6	6
They wanted our ideas and a big agency,	6	6
so we gave them both.	6	6
Just for Chevy?	6	6
No, we merged--	6	6
furniture, fixtures, everything.	6	6
I'm sorry, I don't understand.	6	6
I did this wrong once before,	6	6
so let me tell you how great it's going to be	6	6
and you can decide if you want to come along.	6	6
You are the copy chief	6	6
at one of the top 25 ad agencies in the country.	6	6
You're not even 30. I'm jealous.	6	6
I just bought an apartment.	6	6
Congratulations.	6	6
Are we moving?	6	6
We are, and we'd like you to write the press release.	6	6
For what?	6	6
We don't have a name yet,	6	6
but make it sound like the agency	6	6
you want to work for.	6	6
Who do I give it to?	6	6
Give it to Ted.	6	6
New York City,	6	6
May 17, 1968.	6	6

Ted.	6	7
First day of school. You nervous?	6	7
What do you think?	6	7
It seems silly to ask, but do you know where you're going?	6	7
I'll just follow you.	6	7
- Hello, everyone. - Hey!	6	7
Stan, Ginsberg, Ted Chaough.	6	7
This is Margie. Margie, Peggy. Margie, Ted.	6	7
 It's nice to put faces with names.	6	7
I saw you taking your little tour the other week	6	7
and you looked pretty tall.	6	7
But now I see you're about my height.	6	7
I hope you can still look up to me.	6	7
- That was quick. - Pleasure, Margie.	6	7
I've heard a lot about you. We're all very excited.	6	7
Nice knowing you.	6	7
John Mathis.	6	7
You're in the second office from reception.	6	7
Your secretary will be Connie.	6	7
You know my name, but I don't know yours.	6	7
Excuse me, Joan.	6	7
Are all the creatives in one office?	6	7
- It's temporary. - Well, it's going to be very crowded.	6	7
But that may change soon.	6	7
I know where all the bodies are buried.	6	7
- I need a copy of that. - They're just notes.	6	7
I need a copy for Mr. Chaough.	6	7
He's not going to change anything,	6	7
but he's going to be angry if I don't know what it is.	6	7
Good morning, Moira.	6	7
- Joan. - Good morning.	6	7
- Well, hello there. - Hello.	6	7
I'm sorry they didn't have your office ready yet.	6	7
I'll make do.	6	7
You know what, Moira?	6	7
I'll take care of Miss Olson.	6	7
Hopefully you can read my handwriting.	6	7
We're putting you in Harry's old office.	6	7
- Oh. - But you don't have to share it.	6	7
As long as I don't have to share Phyllis.	6	7
- ( gasps ) - Are you okay?	6	7
I don't know.	6	7
It could be moving boxes or it could be I slept funny.	6	7
Are you still in there?	6	7
Yes, everything keeps changing out here,	6	7
but everything's the same in there.	6	7
Except you're a partner.	6	7
And you're the copy chief. _	6	7
How's your little boy?	6	7
He's the man in my life.	6	7
- How's yours? - Oh, he's good.	6	7
We bought a building together to live in.	6	7
We bought a building to live in together.	6	7
I'm glad you're here.	6	7
Well, I'm glad you're here.	6	7
"""In addition to the dynamic press reception"	6	7
and renewed interest from Wall Street,	6	7
the union of these two agencies has already brought us victory.	6	7
Our congratulations to Mr. Chaough	6	7
and Mr. Gleason for their recent victory at the Clio Awards	6	7
for the one-minute television commercial 'Little Headaches'	6	7
"on behalf of St. Joseph's Children's 'Aspirine.'"""	6	7
( applause )	6	7
"""In closing..."""	6	7
Well, that's a beautiful message	6	7
to read to our employees,	6	7
but perhaps it's best to wait	6	7
until we've made all of the personnel changes.	6	7
And you need an ending.	6	7
We have a lot of writers out there.	6	7
I'm sorry. Someone commandeered Clara.	6	7
I need a seat.	6	7
Don took the last one.	6	7
That means you were here after Don.	6	7
Can you see if there's another chair?	6	7
Or you could have my seat.	6	7
Yes, thank you.	6	7
Moira, take my chair.	6	7
Now that we've dispensed with the gallantry,	6	7
Jim Cutler and I have, we believe, harvested	6	7
the gold dusting of the Clios	6	7
by arranging for an advanced introduction	6	7
to Fleischmann's Margarine.	6	7
They want to be Ted and Don's first love child.	6	7
That's new business.	6	7
Isn't there a section of this meeting called good news?	6	7
I never would have taken you for such a stickler.	6	7
Fleischmann's? Groovy. We'll get right on it.	6	7
Regarding ongoing business,	6	7
the following is a list of current accounts in ascending order.	6	7
That means smallest to largest,	6	7
Chevrolet being excluded for a separate meeting.	6	7
Topaz Pantyhose.	6	7
Ken Cosgrove and Burt Peterson.	6	7
- And they're thrilled. - Leica Camera.	6	7
Roger and I might have to go to Germany.	6	7
But that's only because we invited ourselves.	6	7
The New York State Thruway.	6	7
I just got off the phone	6	7
with Henry Lammott at Mohawk Airlines...	6	7
Mohawk's on the next page.	6	7
This is related to the Thruway.	6	7
Henry Lammott considers it a conflict,	6	7
car travel and air travel being mortal enemies.	6	7
So when Burt Peterson gets ahold of them, we should resign.	6	7
Did you tell Lammott that was a stretch?	6	7
It's a $250,000 media budget.	6	7
Mohawk is an airline.	6	7
Except, Ted, the client is New York State	6	7
and they gave us their media buy up front.	6	7
- And you already spent it. - Why didn't you tell us that?	6	7
Why didn't you tell us you lost Vicks for yourself and Clearasil for us?	6	7
Why didn't you tell us Frank Gleason was dying?	6	7
Frank's going to be fine.	6	7
I know Henry Lammott.	6	7
Pete and I will fly up there.	6	7
And Ted.	6	7
Of course.	6	7
What kind of plane do you have?	6	7
A Mohawk plane.	6	7
Ted's a pilot.	6	7
I'll take us up there.	6	7
We can land right outside his office.	6	7
- Even better. - I'm sorry to interrupt.	6	7
Mr. Campbell, there's an urgent phone call for you.	6	7
However we're going,	6	7
I recommend we go up tomorrow.	6	7
What's the next client?	6	7
Um, Koss Headphones.	6	7
Jim: Burt Peterson and Ken Cosgrove.	6	7
They sent Burt Peterson a case of champagne.	6	7
Billy?	6	7
Mr. Campbell, I didn't want to trouble you,	6	7
but she was...	6	7
she's right here. You want to talk to her?	6	7
What happened exactly?	6	7
Well, she was banging on the door pretty hard,	6	7
saying she needed to see your father.	6	7
I thought somebody was gonna call a cop.	6	7
May I speak with her?	6	7
Bill, you've been so decent, I hate to ask you another favor,	6	7
but could you get her a G and T with two ice cubes?	6	7
- Gin and tonic? - Yes, if you don't mind.	6	7
I don't know what's going on,	6	7
but I found this address on my nightstand	6	7
in some woman's handwriting	6	7
and I assumed your father was up to his old tricks.	6	7
Mother, he passed away.	6	7
You'd like that. No.	6	7
He hasn't been home for over a week	6	7
and his golf clubs are still at the house.	6	7
( ice cracks )	6	7
Mother, you sound confused.	6	7
What are you implying?	6	7
I want you to relax, watch the television,	6	7
and I will call Bud to come and get you.	6	7
He's going to send that girl Trudy.	6	7
Bud's wife is Judy, not Trudy.	6	7
Now I suppose I'm crazy for mixing those up.	6	7
Tell Billy you're fine on your own.	6	7
I am.	6	7
( sighs )	6	7
Hello there.	6	7
Nice to see you, Peggy.	6	7
Burt.	6	7
We're a long way from Sterling Cooper.	6	7
Looks like the worm has turned.	6	7
Well, it's nice to have the old team back together.	6	7
- ( phone ringing ) - Do you want me to get that?	6	7
Hello.	6	7
Oh, I was expecting a secretary.	6	7
There isn't one on the line, is there?	6	7
Hold on.	6	7
I've got to take this.	6	7
Well, we'll have plenty of time to catch up	6	7
on those flights to Detroit.	6	7
He's still a cold fish.	6	7
Hello.	6	7
Come over here now.	6	7
I can't.	6	7
I have too much going on in the office.	6	7
I need you	6	7
and nothing else will do.	6	7
Oh.	6	7
So?	6	7
12:30 at the Sherry-Netherland.	6	7
Call me with a room number.	6	7
Come on in, Burt.	6	7
Have a seat.	6	7
What is this, a bed?	6	7
Yeah, you might want to lie down	6	7
because here we are again.	6	7
Well, I haven't forgotten anything.	6	7
Not a damn thing.	6	7
A lot of times in life you get to do something	6	7
and you don't realize until it's over	6	7
how much you enjoyed it.	6	7
And you swear that the next time it comes around,	6	7
you're gonna remember that.	6	7
You're right.	6	7
And I think I can work with you, too.	6	7
Work?	6	7
No, Burt, I'm letting you go again.	6	7
What the hell? You... you can't do that.	6	7
Probably doesn't make a difference at this point, but no one fought for you.	6	7
Well, we'll see what the folks at Chevy have to say about this.	6	7
Remember Ken Cosgrove?	6	7
Like a six-foot version of Alan Ladd?	6	7
He's touring the plant right now.	6	7
You bastard.	6	7
I've got four million in billings.	6	7
- What have you got? - I was thinking you would feel that way.	6	7
That you had more clients and that gives you a voice.	6	7
I was imagining you talking over me in meetings.	6	7
Now I don't have that problem.	6	7
My clients will leave with me.	6	7
( chuckles ) No one will ever say you weren't funny, Burt.	6	7
Well, I'll tell you one thing,	6	7
I'm expecting some kind of severance.	6	7
Who knows? We're really hurting.	6	7
We're having to cut back. Well, obviously.	6	7
God, you're a real prick, you know that?	6	7
Damn it, Burt, you stole my good-bye.	6	7
Oh, hello. You must be Burt Peterson.	6	7
I'm Bob Benson. I'm supposed to report to you.	6	7
Well, as a first order of business,	6	7
I recommend that you stick your head between your legs	6	7
and kiss your ass good-bye.	6	7
What did you say to me?	6	7
Come see me.	6	7
No.	6	7
I need you	6	7
and nothing else will do.	6	7
You worked on the Daisy?	6	7
No, I worked on the KKK spot.	6	7
You probably heard about it. It was too hot to run.	6	7
- That's very impressive. - Thank you.	6	7
I mean, you made it 15 minutes before you brought it up.	6	7
( chuckles )	6	7
I just spoke with Dawn.	6	7
Black or white?	6	7
She wouldn't tell me anything.	6	7
She's an excellent secretary.	6	7
I'm sure he can catch up.	6	7
So, before we inundate ourselves with Fleischmann's unique benefits	6	7
and previous work, I want to, I don't know,	6	7
have a little rap session about margarine in general.	6	7
You mean like in terms of the prospect?	6	7
Just whatever's on your mind. Free-associate.	6	7
- ( whispers ) - My grandmother.	6	7
Yeah.	6	7
Yellow.	6	7
Yes.	6	7
Greasy.	6	7
It's not butter. It's cheap.	6	7
It has no smell.	6	7
Yeah, man. Keep going.	6	7
People hate it.	6	7
Hold on a second. Who hates margarine?	6	7
You said there were no wrong answers.	6	7
- I didn't say that. - I don't hate it.	6	7
It was invented for Napoleon III	6	7
because armies need to move and it never spoiled.	6	7
That's fantastic.	6	7
How did you know that?	6	7
I don't know, I just did.	6	7
Let's get down 10 uses for margarine.	6	7
French army is number one.	6	7
And of course I was upset	6	7
because I was waiting for Mitchell to call.	6	7
Then Arnie tells me to cut the apron strings.	6	7
All of France is on fire.	6	7
I don't even know if the phones are working.	6	7
There's no room for me to worry about anyone but Arnold,	6	7
not even our son.	6	7
You can talk about your kid,	6	7
but I don't want to hear about your husband.	6	7
I can talk about whatever I want.	6	7
Can you help me look for my shoes while you do it?	6	7
You want me to look for your shoes?	6	7
I want you to crawl on your hands and knees until you find them.	6	7
( scoffs )	6	7
They're right over there.	6	7
Do it.	6	7
I want you to get undressed,	6	7
then get back into bed.	6	7
Come over here.	6	7
( key jangles )	6	7
Don't go anywhere.	6	7
I'm hearing a lot about bread.	6	7
It spreads easy because it's soft.	6	7
Really melts into the...	6	7
What did he just say?	6	7
Don. There you are.	6	7
Sorry about that. I got held up.	6	7
Let's not push too hard today.	6	7
- What'd I miss? - We got some good ideas,	6	7
and I think we're ready for a more traditional approach...	6	7
research, et cetera... later in the week.	6	7
Great. Peggy, you set the meeting.	6	7
What was that?	6	7
What? You called the meeting to a close.	6	7
You also had it without me.	6	7
If the meeting's at 1:00, the meeting's at 1:00.	6	7
Don, five minutes, 10 minutes...	6	7
I've been working in creative my whole life, it's fine.	6	7
40 minutes? Come on.	6	7
I've got better things to do,	6	7
but obviously you did, too.	6	7
( ringing )	6	7
Hello.	6	7
Are you still in bed?	6	7
Are you on your way?	6	7
You're going to wait there	6	7
and you're not going to know when I'm coming back.	6	7
What's gotten into you?	6	7
Don't answer the phone again.	6	7
( ringing )	6	7
( intercom buzzes )	6	7
- Yes? - Moira: Mr. Draper is here to see you.	6	7
Send him in.	6	7
- Am I bothering you? - What is that?	6	7
An olive branch.	6	7
I was just thinking that it's probably best	6	7
if we talk about margarine by ourselves.	6	7
Sorry, I don't know what you drink.	6	7
Whatever there is.	6	7
Of course, everything is packed away.	6	7
I would have opened that first.	6	7
Might have clients coming in.	6	7
I have something better for the clients.	6	7
I have this bar cart wheeled in.	6	7
How is that better?	6	7
You should see the girl who wheels it in.	6	7
It's quite a presentation.	6	7
If you don't want to drink, you don't have to drink.	6	7
So, you want to show me your notes from the meeting?	6	7
It took 40 minutes to figure out no one knows shit about margarine.	6	7
( chuckles )	6	7
May I?	6	7
Is this gonna be Detroit again?	6	7
You're gonna lie down on the couch while I pace?	6	7
I'll lie down after we have our next one.	6	7
Let's get something on paper first.	6	7
- Where is she? - Well, she spent 25 minutes	6	7
looking for a dish for the nuts and then she went into the bathroom.	6	7
- Good luck. - Where are you going?	6	7
She's using the ladies' room. She's been doing it for years.	6	7
- No, take her home. - My home?	6	7
- That's not an option. - That is the only option.	6	7
Do you have any idea what's going on in my office?	6	7
We're in the middle of a merger,	6	7
in case you didn't get past the sports section.	6	7
I'm supposed to suddenly care after you went	6	7
to White Weld to underwrite your public offering?	6	7
I caught a shovelful for that, Pete.	6	7
I got to pretend to my partners that you don't believe in nepotism.	6	7
I apologize that you didn't get on that sinking ship.	6	7
You just ride out this merger,	6	7
and in six months I'm your first call.	6	7
You don't understand. I went to a meeting this morning	6	7
- and there was no chair for me. - You're as high-strung as her.	6	7
First you don't have a chair, then you don't have any clients.	6	7
- Mother, it's time to go. - Don't do that yet.	6	7
Just get your thoughts together.	6	7
- You have a long drive home. - She has an apartment.	6	7
Even the cleaning woman quit.	6	7
Mother's cut all ties. The whole place smells like a rabbit warren.	6	7
Judy and I have taken our turn. Now it's yours.	6	7
No, that is not going to work. ( toilet flushes )	6	7
( sighs ) Judy is finished with her.	6	7
They got in a dispute about Earl Grey or Major Grey	6	7
and Mother snapped her with a tea towel across the face.	6	7
She should be locked up.	6	7
Maybe we can get the paperwork started.	6	7
In the meantime, buy Trudy a catcher's mask	6	7
and be happy that you get to go to work every day.	6	7
I know why he's late for everything.	6	7
Because we've put up with it.	6	7
I mean, honestly, is Peter any busier than you are?	6	7
Mother, I'm Peter.	6	7
Do you want to go to the Colony?	6	7
That's a splendid idea.	6	7
No, I have some soup.	6	7
Just take me home.	6	7
You're spending the night here. You can have the bed.	6	7
I never sleep.	6	7
And you should be well rested.	6	7
Could you freshen this?	6	7
So Blue Bonnet is the girl in pigtails?	6	7
Mary Ann.	6	7
"""Gilligan's Island"" always works."	6	7
Every brand is represented.	6	7
So Fleischmann's is the Marilyn Monroe redhead?	6	7
I don't know who's Ginger.	6	7
Probably Parkay.	6	7
Then you've got Thurston Howell...	6	7
Imperial with the crown.	6	7
I think the one that's wide open is the Professor.	6	7
Facts and figures, health benefits.	6	7
Some kind of formula.	6	7
They're all made differently,	6	7
even if it's just location.	6	7
No, I find it interesting	6	7
that you've broken this down into a formula.	6	7
There's a lot of bridges to Manhattan.	6	7
You don't have any tricks for when you're stuck other than...	6	7
Are we stuck already?	6	7
Let's take the competition to a broader level.	6	7
Let's say there are more margarines than characters on your TV show.	6	7
They all have something in common.	6	7
They all want off the island.	6	7
No, they're all not butter.	6	7
- No one prefers margarine. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.	6	7
I have to eat something.	6	7
Doesn't ice count?	6	7
I'd settle for some more toast.	6	7
Ahem.	6	7
( sighs )	6	7
It's morning.	6	7
We know because we see the rooster crow.	6	7
A farmer's wife sets pancakes on the kitchen table.	6	7
She puts a pat of margarine on top.	6	7
Then sets the dish down next to the yellowest fried eggs,	6	7
a loaf of homemade bread,	6	7
and a beading pitcher of heavy cream.	6	7
Syrup pours.	6	7
A smile comes over their Dorothea Lange faces.	6	7
Two things... cows	6	7
because she's a dairy farmer's wife,	6	7
and I want bacon.	6	7
It's not up for debate.	6	7
( knocking )	6	7
_	6	7
( knocks ) Joan: Just a minute.	6	7
I said just a minute.	6	7
I thought you said come in.	6	7
I got everyone's paperwork. I just wanted to drop them off.	6	7
You look a little wan.	6	7
I think I have food poisoning.	6	7
Do you want some ice water?	6	7
Oh! God...	6	7
Do you have your appendix?	6	7
- It's the other side. - You can't stay here.	6	7
And I can't leave, either.	6	7
Just walk with me and I'll bother you all the way out.	6	7
No one will know.	6	7
So I get the laxative people into the booth	6	7
and I record three or four spots at one time.	6	7
Who talked Topaz into television?	6	7
I did, but then Margie took it over.	6	7
The client still calls me Peggy.	6	7
Everybody, everybody.	6	7
I'm taking a survey.	6	7
It's Eugene McCarthy versus Bobby Kennedy.	6	7
How many for Kennedy?	6	7
Show of hands.	6	7
But Humphrey has all the delegates.	6	7
I'm voting for Nixon.	6	7
Oh, I knew it, Mathis.	6	7
What's wrong with you?	6	7
Don't you have any hope?	6	7
I'm for Bobby.	6	7
Well, I... Ted?	6	7
You okay?	6	7
Why don't you call it a day?	6	7
Come on.	6	7
- What about him? - Let him sleep it off.	6	7
Ted, come on.	6	7
I'm fine.	6	7
( man coughing )	6	7
( woman talking over PA )	6	7
Drink that.	6	7
- Is that urine? - It's the pipes.	6	7
The babysitter's agreed to stay,	6	7
but no word from your mother, so I'm not leaving.	6	7
She's probably still in the Catskills.	6	7
Remember Rip Van Winkle?	6	7
You like that story?	6	7
I know it. I could tell it to you.	6	7
No, you should go.	6	7
Who knows what 20 years will do to this place.	6	7
I have no place to go.	6	7
What's gonna happen to Kevin?	6	7
He'll either end up with my mother	6	7
or Greg's parents.	6	7
It's just food poisoning.	6	7
( groans )	6	7
No, that's not what it is.	6	7
Come on. Let's go.	6	7
I've got you.	6	7
Excuse me, Nurse... Finnegan.	6	7
I see how busy you are, but can I trouble you a moment?	6	7
Doctors will see you the moment they can.	6	7
No, it's not about that.	6	7
It's just, well, I'm such a fool	6	7
and I suppose I was trying to be a gentleman,	6	7
- but my friend here, she... - Don't.	6	7
We don't need to see a doctor.	6	7
I'm sure it's something that would be covered by your medical expertise.	6	7
What are you talking about?	6	7
She's a little embarrassed,	6	7
but she drank furniture polish.	6	7
Honey, why'd you do that?	6	7
She wasn't wearing her glasses.	6	7
You do need to see a doctor. Why didn't you tell me that?	6	7
I'm sorry. I really never know what to do.	6	7
I thought I'd just leave it up to you.	6	7
Okay, sweetheart. Ramirez.	6	7
Take her to bed four.	6	7
( woman speaking over PA )	6	7
She'll be fine.	6	7
( lock clicking )	6	7
You look perfect.	6	7
Well, I had three hours to get ready.	6	7
I don't know if the shoes go.	6	7
They do.	6	7
Where are we going?	6	7
We're not going anywhere.	6	7
Are you kidding me?	6	7
Why would you think you're going anywhere?	6	7
You are for me.	6	7
You exist in this room for my pleasure.	6	7
Are we going to eat?	6	7
Don't ask any more questions.	6	7
Take off your dress.	6	7
Take off everything for me.	6	7
Like that?	6	7
( thunder rumbling )	6	7
I think you look worse than I do.	6	7
Well, I slept on the floor of my office.	6	7
They didn't give you a couch?	6	7
I couldn't find it. Draper knocked me out.	6	7
Not literally.	6	7
I'm sure there's a lot of work to do.	6	7
It's got nothing to do with work.	6	7
He seems more interested in me than he is in the work.	6	7
But you're not very interesting.	6	7
He doesn't know that.	6	7
What's he like?	6	7
He's mysterious.	6	7
But I can't tell if he's putting it on.	6	7
He doesn't talk for long stretches,	6	7
and then he's incredibly eloquent.	6	7
He's very successful.	6	7
You didn't think he was charmless, did you?	6	7
You learned to work with me.	6	7
And look at you.	6	7
If I wait patiently by the river,	6	7
the body of my enemy will float by.	6	7
( sighs ) Such a waste of energy.	6	7
Give him the early rounds. He'll tire himself out.	6	7
Go home, shower,	6	7
walk back in there like you own half the place.	6	7
I'll be back at dinnertime.	6	7
Because you live here.	6	7
No, I don't.	6	7
There's a hamper full of laundry	6	7
and a razor in the sink.	6	7
Is Trudy finished with you?	6	7
This is our pied-à-terre.	6	7
Does your father bring prostitutes here	6	7
or is it just for yours?	6	7
I want to be taken home.	6	7
Your apartment's been overrun with vermin.	6	7
They're spraying all day.	6	7
Oh.	6	7
I didn't remember that. I want to get my things.	6	7
It's raining very hard out and it's, well...	6	7
it's St. Patrick's Day.	6	7
- It's May. - No, it's not.	6	7
And who knows what's out there?	6	7
I'll have the cook make your favorite for dinner.	6	7
( door closes )	6	7
- Morning. - You look fresh.	6	7
Where's my secretary?	6	7
Or is this how they do it at CGC,	6	7
just let yourself in?	6	7
I didn't want to wait out there	6	7
because this whole visit is confidential.	6	7
You want to quit already?	6	7
When you told me about the merger,	6	7
I hoped he would rub off on you,	6	7
not the other way around.	6	7
He's getting everything he wants	6	7
and obviously you're on his side.	6	7
Why did you do it at all if there are sides?	6	7
You could have just tried to hire me back.	6	7
You never even asked me to lunch.	6	7
Yes, Peggy, we risked our entire company	6	7
just so I could have you in this office complaining again.	6	7
Well, he can't drink like you.	6	7
And you must know that because nobody can.	6	7
- Peggy, he's a grown man. - So are you.	6	7
Move forward.	6	7
( door closes )	6	7
You're going to be fine. With Burt Peterson gone,	6	7
Kenny in Detroit, everything's going to fall in your in-box.	6	7
What about Cutler?	6	7
What about every time there's a change around here,	6	7
I get knocked down to a worse office?	6	7
( knocks ) Come in, Scarlett.	6	7
Mr. Campbell, I'm sorry to interrupt,	6	7
but you're needed on the phone.	6	7
What now, Clara?	6	7
Is she injured?	6	7
No, but there's been a fire.	6	7
( sighs ) Call Henry at Mohawk. See if he can meet tomorrow.	6	7
I have no idea how long this will take.	6	7
Trudy?	6	7
( door closes )	6	7
( rain pattering )	6	7
I don't know what it is.	6	7
I just don't want to think about anything.	6	7
Who told you you were allowed to think?	6	7
So, what do I do now?	6	7
You fall asleep the minute I close that door.	6	7
I'm flying upstate,	6	7
and when I come back, I want you ready for me.	6	7
I can do that standing on my head.	6	7
And I'm taking this.	6	7
Really? Come on.	6	7
I'm taking it.	6	7
Something's come up. Do you have a minute for Clara?	6	7
Pete Campbell's secretary.	6	7
Certainly.	6	7
Mr. Campbell had an emergency and Mr. Draper is out,	6	7
so I wanted to make sure you knew that we were rescheduling	6	7
this afternoon's meeting with Mohawk.	6	7
Absolutely not.	6	7
What the hell is going on around here?	6	7
( knocks ) Ready to go?	6	7
I am, but apparently Pete Campbell wants to move it.	6	7
We can't cancel the meeting to show a client	6	7
how important he is. When can he go?	6	7
It doesn't matter. We should go up there right away.	6	7
It's raining pretty hard. We can wait a couple hours.	6	7
Don't worry about that. Once we're above the clouds, it's sunny as summer.	6	7
( plane rattling )	6	7
How long have you been doing this?	6	7
Not now.	6	7
There we go.	6	7
You can relax now. We're leveled off.	6	7
I am relaxed.	6	7
( rattles )	6	7
Sometimes when you're flying,	6	7
you think you're right side up, but you're really upside down.	6	7
Really?	6	7
Got to watch your instruments.	6	7
You don't want to take in the wonder of God's majesty?	6	7
I like to read on planes. I don't like to talk.	6	7
But you're gonna talk to Henry Lammott.	6	7
I mean, you're the one that knows him.	6	7
Does it matter?	6	7
No matter what I say,	6	7
you're the guy who flew us up here in his own plane.	6	7
I guess that's true.	6	7
I don't know if Joanie's awake.	6	7
I really don't need to see her.	6	7
You can just give Kevin my gift.	6	7
Oh. Oh.	6	7
( chuckles ) Hello.	6	7
I really wasn't planning on dropping in.	6	7
I just wanted to see if you were feeling better.	6	7
The hospital wouldn't tell me anything because I'm not immediate family.	6	7
He's two years old. He'll play with the bow.	6	7
- ( laughs ) - Sit down. Have a snack.	6	7
No, that's all. Don't want to be away from the office too long.	6	7
Although I left my overcoat on my chair,	6	7
so they know I'm there.	6	7
Well, it's nice meeting you.	6	7
He's adorable.	6	7
He's too young.	6	7
I can tell you from experience	6	7
that younger men are not intimidated by powerful women.	6	7
- He's not interested. - He saved your life.	6	7
It was just a cyst on my ovary.	6	7
I would have been fine. He's worrying about his job.	6	7
Well, why wouldn't he?	6	7
It doesn't take away what he did.	6	7
Honestly, Joan, every good deed	6	7
is not part of a plan.	6	7
She left the teakettle on. It was mostly smoke.	6	7
Can you get Henry Lammott on the phone?	6	7
I will, but Mr. Lammott already called for you.	6	7
Don and Ted thought it was best not to wait.	6	7
Really? They went without me?	6	7
Yes. Apparently it went very well.	6	7
Damn it, Clara. They went without me.	6	7
Therefore, it did not go very well.	6	7
You do understand that your employment here is tied to me?	6	7
And if things happen without me,	6	7
they'll eventually happen without you.	6	7
Don't feel bad that you were taking care of your mother.	6	7
My mother can go to hell.	6	7
Ted Chaough can fly her there.	6	7
Do you want me to get Mr. Lammott on the phone?	6	7
Can you give me a minute?	6	7
( door closes )	6	7
I'm here.	6	7
Where are you going?	6	7
I think it's time to go home.	6	7
Not yet.	6	7
I think this is over.	6	7
It's over when I say it's over.	6	7
I had a dream that you crashed in that plane.	6	7
But I'm back.	6	7
I dreamt I went to your funeral	6	7
and Megan cried on my shoulder.	6	7
- Stop it. - And then I went back to Arnold	6	7
and I made love to him and I said,	6	7
"""I've been away, but I'm home."""	6	7
It means you missed me.	6	7
No.	6	7
It means it's time to really go home.	6	7
This is over,	6	7
and not just this.	6	7
It's easy to give up something when you're satisfied.	6	7
It's easy to give up something	6	7
when you're ashamed.	6	7
Please.	6	7
Let's go.	6	7
Burt Peterson's gone. That leaves me,	6	7
Jim Torkelson, and Lawrence Harris.	6	7
You've got Roger, Pete, Ken, and Bob Benson.	6	7
But you've got your creatives Peggy, Cecil, and Beanie.	6	7
We lost Margie, Koch, and Steve Hagan.	6	7
I don't know who Peggy counts for, but we need Bob.	6	7
Bob's got to go. Last hired, first fired.	6	7
Very well.	6	7
But before I cross him off, let me remind you	6	7
that Bob has been very involved in Ken's accounts,	6	7
and with Ken servicing Detroit,	6	7
I don't know how long it'll take Lawrence to catch up.	6	7
Fine, Lawrence is gone. Are we done here?	6	7
The secretarial staff?	6	7
( elevator humming )	6	7
( elevator bell dings )	6	7
And instead of being afraid,	6	7
I realized I should just ask for a couple of weeks off.	6	7
They write people out all the time.	6	7
Or I could shoot in advance	6	7
and maybe we could go to Honolulu again.	6	7
This time without business.	6	7
I just thought it would be fun to go on a trip,	6	7
the two of us for a bit without the kids.	6	7
( voice fades out )	6	7
Peter.	6	7
They shot that poor Kennedy boy.	6	7
That was years ago, Mother.	6	7
I just saw it on the television.	6	7
( sighs ) It's 6:00 AM.	6	7
You'll be late for school.	6	7
Please just let me sleep.	6	7
I don't understand what's going on.	6	7
They're shooting everybody.	6	7
Reporter: Senator Kennedy then going off	6	7
into the kitchen area to retire to his room for the evening,	6	7
or at least for the next hour or so,	6	7
the crowd spreading around him, shaking hands,	6	7
clapping him on the back.	6	7
Then some shots ring out.	6	7
"""CBS News"" cameraman James Wilson filming this."	6	7
And the next picture you see is that of Senator Kennedy	6	7
lying on the floor, the crowd around him screaming,	6	7
unbelieving that such a thing could happen.	6	7

♪ That people are finally getting together... ♪	6	7
Reporter: A score of hands beneath his back,	6	7
beneath his head, trying to talk to him.	6	7
At this time it was understood that Senator Kennedy was conscious,	6	7
although it was not understood if he said anything at all.	6	7
Senator Kennedy now at Good Samaritan Hospital	6	7
in Los Angeles alive, we are understood, his heart beating.	6	7

(theme music playing)	6	8
- (horn blaring) - Feel that torque?	6	8
It's like riding a hard-on.	6	8
Come on, floor it.	6	8
My little girl's got a heavier foot.	6	8
- (men laughing) - I'm going back.	6	8
Knock it off, Mikey.	6	8
Go on the shoulder. I want to shoot this sign.	6	8
Put the gun away, Jack.	6	8
Jesus, what the hell are you doing?	6	8
- (horn blaring) - (tires screeching)	6	8
 Sylvia: Arnie, you should eat something.	6	8
How about some leftover veal and some cold pasta?	6	8
Want a beer, honey?	6	8
Chicken salad or tuna?	6	8
Here come the judge.	6	8
What's the difference? Eat it.	6	8
Who says we can't hire more people?	6	8
Why don't you take a nap? Your face looks like a bag of walnuts.	6	8
Everyone should take a rest.	6	8
It's an easy thing to say, isn't it?	6	8
You're not thinking. You're not writing.	6	8
Ted, calm down. You need a nap, too.	6	8
Can you believe this crap?	6	8
Yes, I can.	6	8
 Sorry I'm late.	6	8
You're sorry you're late?	6	8
You couldn't call?	6	8
He called. I told you there's no news.	6	8
You did not make that clear.	6	8
"You really didn't. You just said ""no news."""	6	8
You didn't say Kenny called in.	6	8
- Pow. - Damn it.	6	8
No one cares that I almost got killed?	6	8
What did they say?	6	8
It's just like last time, no.	6	8
- What does that mean? - It means they didn't like it.	6	8
Then they got drunk, they took me for a joyride in the Impala.	6	8
Why can't we have the Impala?	6	8
What did they say?	6	8
They said they didn't like 'em.	6	8
It's your job to make them like them.	6	8
- Are you not up to the task? - Don.	6	8
What? We've given them seven ways to go in six weeks.	6	8
We don't even get to talk to them?	6	8
We have to depend on this cripple?	6	8
You don't know what he's up against.	6	8
I've got to sit down, but I'm not gonna	6	8
if you're just gonna continue to insult me.	6	8
Just sit down.	6	8
(sighs) They gave me this	6	8
and I can't even show it to you.	6	8
What is it? They typed up their rejection?	6	8
It's worse.	6	8
They finally gave me a calendar.	6	8
Three years of monthly deadlines.	6	8
That's the rest of '68, '69, and '70.	6	8
Best case scenario, six months of strategy statements,	6	8
every one of them backed up with copy tests.	6	8
And then, if and when they land on something,	6	8
it's got to kick its way up the ladder through all of GM	6	8
until it gets to God.	6	8
And then He's got to run it past His wife.	6	8
So what happens now?	6	8
You take a swing at it and they take a swing at me.	6	8
They want another packet Tuesday morning.	6	8
- But they want me back on Sunday. - For what?	6	8
I guarantee you they're not going to church.	6	8
We cannot go on like this.	6	8
This is what Chevy is paying us for.	6	8
It's not our clock, it's theirs.	6	8
So what's another weekend?	6	8
Because they're really paying us.	6	8
Mr. Chaough, you have a phone call.	6	8
Take a message.	6	8
It's Nan. It's about that matter.	6	8
Excuse me, Mr. Draper.	6	8
Get all the Chevy materials back in my office.	6	8
- We're working the weekend. - Yes, of course.	6	8
But I wanted to tell you Dr. Rosen is on the phone.	6	8
- Do you want me to take a message? - Yes.	6	8
- I'll find out what it's regarding. - No.	6	8
I'll take it.	6	8
You know what, Don? That's a great idea.	6	8
I'm gonna call my doctor. I'm gonna get Kenny here fixed up.	6	8
I'm gonna get everybody fixed up.	6	8
(door closes)	6	8
Arnold, how are you?	6	8
It's me.	6	8
(exhales) Um...	6	8
I'm glad to hear that.	6	8
Oh, I bet you are,	6	8
because I wanted to let you know that's what that would feel like.	6	8
I thought I misunderstood.	6	8
Oh, bullshit.	6	8
You have got to stop loitering in my hallway.	6	8
Sylvia, I'm glad you called.	6	8
He saw all the cigarette butts out there	6	8
and he thinks I'm smoking again.	6	8
I want to see you.	6	8
I was in the kitchen biting my nails	6	8
"thinking, ""I just cleaned it up."""	6	8
How many nights are you out there?	6	8
I know you want to see me, too.	6	8
All I kept thinking is he's gonna come in	6	8
and ask my why there's no lipstick on them	6	8
and I'm gonna burst into tears and tell him everything.	6	8
Then he's gonna murder me and murder you.	6	8
- Are you afraid of him? - No.	6	8
I'm afraid of you.	6	8
I don't think you understand.	6	8
Look, I'm too old to say this was a mistake,	6	8
but I want you to try and be happy.	6	8
About what?	6	8
That you got away with it.	6	8
When you start something like this,	6	8
it takes a lot of convincing.	6	8
It's all about whether or not the other person	6	8
has as much to lose as you do,	6	8
because you want to be able to trust them when it's over.	6	8
And right now I'm wondering how I ever trusted you.	6	8
I don't really have a choice, do I,	6	8
because you've got me.	6	8
So if you ever really cared about me at all, knock it off.	6	8
Don't cry. Just listen to me.	6	8
I'm feeling a lot of emotions, too.	6	8
I'm hanging up.	6	8
Please, just listen.	6	8
I just want to talk to you about a few things.	6	8
You loved Megan once.	6	8
- Stop it. - Nothing else gets through to you.	6	8
I'm going.	6	8
Don't make me hang up on you.	6	8
I'm hanging up.	6	8
(crashes)	6	8
- (intercom buzzes) - Dawn: Mr. Draper?	6	8
Mr. Draper?	6	8
I'm gonna go in there.	6	8
- Yes? - Is everything okay?	6	8
Yes, I'm fine.	6	8
I'm gonna...	6	8
I'm tired. I'm just gonna take a nap.	6	8
You do that.	6	8
(sighs)	6	8
(coughing)	6	8
(coughing)	6	8
You girls should back away.	6	8
Does he have a fever?	6	8
You get your bedroll.	6	8
You stay in here, you'll get everybody sick.	6	8
- You sleep in the cellar. - Yes, ma'am.	6	8
If the fever doesn't break, we'll call a doctor.	6	8
Better for you than for everyone.	6	8
Aimée, did you leave that plate in the lounge?	6	8
- (intercom buzzes) - Dawn: Mr. Draper?	6	8
- (intercom buzzes) - Yes, what is it?	6	8
Do you need some water?	6	8
No, I'm fine.	6	8
Bobby, go get your suitcase.	6	8
- That's mine. - What about Gene's?	6	8
I'm not going to pack his suitcase.	6	8
I already did it. You just have to get it.	6	8
- Go get it, Geenie. - (door closes)	6	8
Go up there and get Pinocchio and bring it down.	6	8
(sighs) I have to do everything.	6	8
- Where's Daddy? We're ready to go. - I'm taking you.	6	8
Were you sitting under the hair dryer and just remembered that?	6	8
Where did you get that skirt?	6	8
I bought it.	6	8
You mean Megan bought it for you.	6	8
- I earned it. - On what street corner?	6	8
She pays me to babysit.	6	8
You're not a hired hand, you're their sister.	6	8
Boys, let's go.	6	8
- (knocks) - (door opens)	6	8
I'm sorry to bother you,	6	8
but Mr. Cutler wants to see you.	6	8
It's been two and a half hours.	6	8
Do you want to rest some more?	6	8
No.	6	8
May I clean that up?	6	8
Please.	6	8
Put the Chevy materials on the coffee table.	6	8
The funeral will be tomorrow.	6	8
Frank's family has asked that in lieu of flowers	6	8
a donation be made to the American Cancer Society.	6	8
Frank Gleason was a great artist	6	8
and a great friend.	6	8
And he made our company whole.	6	8
I'm not gonna be able to work with you through the weekend.	6	8
I apologize, but I'm afraid this takes precedence.	6	8
I'll attend the funeral if that's all right.	6	8
But I can still make myself available for Chevy.	6	8
That's helpful.	6	8
I'm sorry for your loss.	6	8
He's a piece that cannot be replaced.	6	8
The doctor's here and I want you to see him.	6	8
- I don't know. - No, he's gonna fix you up.	6	8
That's an order.	6	8
Can I see him, too? I did it last time.	6	8
We're a team. If he does it, I do it.	6	8
Age before beauty.	6	8
How old was he?	6	8
Older than you, younger than me.	6	8
You either get used to it or stop thinking about it.	6	8
Sorry about your friend.	6	8
Yeah, it's tragic.	6	8
I hope we don't lose Ted for too long.	6	8
He doesn't know how to deal with these things.	6	8
Do you feel anything? 'Cause I don't.	6	8
He said it takes a minute.	6	8
- Well, maybe I need another. - I'm next.	6	8
Actually, Roger, I think Don should go next. Don.	6	8
Pleasure to meet you. Dr. Hecht.	6	8
Don Draper. Where do you want me?	6	8
Anything in your medical history you want to alert me to?	6	8
No, I'm just...	6	8
hell, I don't even know what I'm doing here.	6	8
You're exhausted.	6	8
I'll need you to turn around and drop your pants.	6	8
- This goes in the gluteus. - What is it?	6	8
It's an energy serum.	6	8
Oh? What's in it?	6	8
It's proprietary. But all you need to know	6	8
is it's a complex vitamin superdose.	6	8
It's basically my own combination of B vitamins and a mild stimulant.	6	8
You have a heart condition?	6	8
No. I thought you said it was mild. What does it do?	6	8
Well, a lot of things. But I think it'll give you	6	8
what Jim Cutler says you need.	6	8
24 to 72 hours	6	8
of uninterrupted creative focus, energy, and confidence.	6	8
- Really? - Really.	6	8
No one told you about this?	6	8
I've visited some agencies lately.	6	8
- You've got a great outfit here. - Thank you.	6	8
All anybody wants to know is what are you gonna call this place?	6	8
Can you tug your drawers down a little?	6	8
"""SCDPCGC""? That's a mouthful."	6	8
- Stan again. - (laughs)	6	8
What do you say, Don? You think you can beat me?	6	8
I want another chance. You changed course.	6	8
- Who's next? - That'd be me.	6	8
- And I have a heart condition. - Don't worry about it.	6	8
(panting)	6	8
(laughs)	6	8
Come on, let's go. Best two out of three.	6	8
(echoing) You can beat me any day. Let me see the doctor first.	6	8
We'll do before and after.	6	8
(coughing)	6	8
(coughing)	6	8
Hey, kid. Where you going?	6	8
Come in here.	6	8
(coughing)	6	8
Sit down.	6	8
Breathe deep.	6	8
(inhales)	6	8
Is that you?	6	8
No.	6	8
It's a chest cold. I've seen plenty of consumption.	6	8
You don't have it.	6	8
Lay down here.	6	8
Your mama don't know how to take care of nobody.	6	8
She ain't my mother.	6	8
(coughs)	6	8
Can I help you?	6	8
Do we know each other?	6	8
I'd like to think so.	6	8
Can I help you?	6	8
I meant from somewhere other than from this moment.	6	8
I don't think so.	6	8
(loud clicking)	6	8
- (men laughing) - (phones ringing)	6	8
(ringing, laughing increases)	6	8
(silent)	6	8
- Where's Ed? - He said his heart stopped.	6	8
Roger took him to the hospital.	6	8
But they were both laughing.	6	8
The strategy is about some kind of love transaction	6	8
between a parent and a child	6	8
involving the greatest gift of all, a Chevy.	6	8
I was a child and she was a child in this kingdom by the sea.	6	8
Four score and seven years ago,	6	8
this country had some memorable happenings.	6	8
What I don't understand is	6	8
"is it ""Dad, I want this car"""	6	8
"or ""Son, I bought you this car""?"	6	8
Great, that's two. We need 15 more and we can try another.	6	8
"In what family is it ""Son, I bought you this car""?"	6	8
- Good night, all. - That guy's family.	6	8
Did you hear about Frank Gleason?	6	8
(laughs) Yeah, I guess dreams do come true.	6	8
I think that's in poor taste.	6	8
Tell him, Peggy. Tell him what a son of a bitch he was.	6	8
I liked him.	6	8
Before he was sick?	6	8
I hate how dying makes saints out of people.	6	8
Well, he's obviously in a better place.	6	8
Have a good weekend.	6	8
"""Dad, I need the car. I've got a date."""	6	8
"""Dad, everybody at school has a car but me."""	6	8
"""Dad, I can only go to college if I have a car."""	6	8
"- ""Dad, I..."" - ""Dad, I could be dying in Vietnam."	6	8
"Don't you want me to have a car?"""	6	8
Damn it, Ginsberg. I had another 80 of them.	6	8
I got nothing interesting to say 'cause I'm not on drugs?	6	8
No, you just flushed a toilet in my head.	6	8
"""Son, I got a car when I was your age."""	6	8
"""Son, they didn't have cars when I was your age."""	6	8
"""Son, you can fly till you're high as an elephant's eye."""	6	8
- (Stan chuckles) - That's great.	6	8
What are you, class secretary?	6	8
I want to write stuff down so it looks like I'm working.	6	8
Fine.	6	8
The child is the father of the man.	6	8
Spectacular.	6	8
- (intercom buzzes) - Dawn: Mr. Draper.	6	8
Mr. Cosgrove is here to see you.	6	8
Hello, Kenny. How you feeling?	6	8
My foot's like new.	6	8
You think you'll have new work on Monday?	6	8
I'll have 15 campaigns for you by then,	6	8
but you have to get me in a room so I can look them in the eye.	6	8
The timbre of my voice is as important as the content.	6	8
I don't know whether I'll be forceful or submissive,	6	8
but I must be there in the flesh.	6	8
You understand that I have no power whatsoever?	6	8
That's not true. Not if they like you.	6	8
- (feet tapping) - Oh, they like me all right.	6	8
(tapping)	6	8
- I'm their favorite toy. - That's your job.	6	8
It's my job to take them to dinner at 80 miles an hour.	6	8
It's my job to stop a mile from the restaurant	6	8
so they can have five pounds of crab legs	6	8
and three bottles of beer apiece and then go get prime rib.	6	8
It's my job to go hunting so they can fire off their guns	6	8
an inch from my ear and laugh	6	8
when I get startled because it's my job.	6	8
Where'd you learn that?	6	8
My mother. No, my first girlfriend.	6	8
(tapping)	6	8
One doesn't like changing so often, you know?	6	8
- I don't know. - I'm not myself, you see?	6	8
I don't see.	6	8
And she comes to the fork in the road	6	8
"then she says to the Cheshire Cat, ""Which road do I take?"""	6	8
I know this. Where do you want to go?	6	8
- I don't know. - Then it doesn't matter, does it?	6	8
- How's it going? - What's going on?	6	8
I know you're all feeling the darkness here today.	6	8
But there's no reason to give in.	6	8
No matter what you've heard, this process will not take years.	6	8
In my heart I know we cannot be defeated	6	8
because there is an answer that will open the door.	6	8
There is a way around this system.	6	8
This is a test of our patience	6	8
and commitment.	6	8
One great idea can win someone over.	6	8
Dear Lord, you're as good as they say.	6	8
That was very inspiring.	6	8
Do you have any idea what the idea is?	6	8
No.	6	8
But I'm not gonna stop looking.	6	8
(sighs) I think we should order dinner.	6	8
I don't think I'll ever eat again.	6	8
Do what you have to.	6	8
(coughing)	6	8
- You're burning up. - (sniffles)	6	8
You have to eat something. Sit up.	6	8
I can't, Miss Swenson.	6	8
Call me Aimée, and yes, you can.	6	8
(coughing)	6	8
I've got it.	6	8
I've got it.	6	8
How many times do you do it?	6	8
I need six throws for a reading.	6	8
What are you doing?	6	8
The I Ching.	6	8
Have you slept?	6	8
Crap, I missed the funeral, didn't I?	6	8
- How was it? - It was rough.	6	8
It was beautiful.	6	8
Who are you?	6	8
Her name is Wendy. Wendy, this is Don.	6	8
Don. Ask a question.	6	8
- I'm supposed to be next. - Are you done with mine?	6	8
You can just think of it. You don't have to say it out loud.	6	8
Perfect.	6	8
Peggy, do you remember when we had soup?	6	8
(chuckles) Maybe.	6	8
Could you be more specific?	6	8
Carnegie Deli has great soup.	6	8
No, he's talking about some account.	6	8
He asked me yesterday. I don't think it exists.	6	8
- No, I didn't. - I don't understand what you're asking.	6	8
We had an account at Sterling Cooper. A soup account.	6	8
That must have been before my time.	6	8
Can you go to the archives and look for it?	6	8
I already looked. Why are you asking her?	6	8
- 'Cause you think I'm incompetent? - I did it!	6	8
I've got 666 ideas.	6	8
I'm wasting my Saturday with lunatics.	6	8
- It's Saturday? - Yes, it is.	6	8
Why don't you lay down for a little while?	6	8
Because I've got it. I want you to go to the archives.	6	8
Look in 1958 or '59 for soup.	6	8
You'll know it when you see it	6	8
and it's gonna crack this thing wide open.	6	8
You see the mess you made?	6	8
Wendy: That was fast.	6	8
What are you doing in here?	6	8
You said you were going to get some ice	6	8
and we were going to have a drink and watch the sun set.	6	8
I have some things to do.	6	8
Stop doing that.	6	8
(chuckles) You are really uptight, aren't you?	6	8
No, I'm just on a deadline.	6	8
Where'd you get that?	6	8
It was upstairs in one of the offices.	6	8
You want to get it on?	6	8
Wendy, what are you doing here?	6	8
I'm here to make you feel better.	6	8
I feel great, but I'm on a deadline.	6	8
"""Does someone love me?"""	6	8
What?	6	8
That's what your question was.	6	8
Why would you say that?	6	8
That's everyone's question.	6	8
I want to hear your heart.	6	8
Oh.	6	8
I think it's broken.	6	8
You can hear that?	6	8
I can't hear anything.	6	8
I think it's broken.	6	8
You should go.	6	8
I'm in the middle of something.	6	8
(door opens)	6	8
(door closes)	6	8
(phone ringing, TV playing)	6	8
Megan: Can you get that?	6	8
If it's Jeff Hunter, I'll be right there.	6	8
- Draper's. - Sally?	6	8
- When are you coming home? - Is Megan there?	6	8
- I want to talk to him. - It's my dad.	6	8
Where are you?	6	8
I'm still at work.	6	8
I have to leave. I'm leaving right now.	6	8
I'm really sorry. I'm not finished yet.	6	8
It... I'm really close.	6	8
It's just the research hasn't come in.	6	8
Don, I don't care. What am I supposed to do?	6	8
I watched them last night so you could work and now...	6	8
I'll be home in a little bit.	6	8
Well, I don't like you working so hard.	6	8
You must be exhausted.	6	8
Actually, I've got a second wind.	6	8
When's he coming home?	6	8
Sally, how would you like to earn some boots to go with that skirt?	6	8
You're going to leave us with her again?	6	8
I'm really sorry, sweetie, but you know you'll have fun.	6	8
Don't make her feel bad.	6	8
Where are you going?	6	8
I'm going to see a play.	6	8
And Jeff my agent is going to introduce me to some producers	6	8
so that maybe I can be in their play.	6	8
Why do you want to do a play?	6	8
You're on TV every day. Don't they know that?	6	8
Shit, you must be hungry.	6	8
Sally, would you put a pot of water on the stove?	6	8
I'm gonna make spaghetti in a minute.	6	8
I'm gonna wait for Dad.	6	8
We're not hungry.	6	8
Okay, but go make Gene a peanut butter and jelly.	6	8
Come on, that thing's twice the size of a real apple.	6	8
Step right up.	6	8
How about everybody takes one?	6	8
Do a real firing squad.	6	8
He's gonna look just like Saint Sebastian.	6	8
Hold on a second. One at a time.	6	8
Everybody'll get a chance.	6	8
You're pretentious, you know that?	6	8
I love that.	6	8
I'm gonna do it.	6	8
Fine, but I'm gonna go first	6	8
because you're drunk.	6	8
In fact, I believe I'm the only person	6	8
in the Time-Life Building who's not out of his mind.	6	8
But you hate him.	6	8
I hate apples more.	6	8
Don't hit his eye.	6	8
Don't hit anything.	6	8
- (grunts) - Ah!	6	8
- Aw, crap. - Who's next?	6	8
It's fine. It's fine. I've done that before.	6	8
- Doesn't hurt at all. - Let me see. Let me see.	6	8
You've gotta keep pressure on it.	6	8
Honestly, Peggy, I don't even feel it.	6	8
Come on, you've got to wash this.	6	8

I didn't know anybody was home.	6	8
What are you doing?	6	8

What are you doing here?	6	8
I'm visiting. Didn't nobody tell you?	6	8
No. Who are you?	6	8
I'm your grandma.	6	8
That's impossible.	6	8
Now, why is that impossible?	6	8
Okay, I know.	6	8
But I raised your daddy.	6	8
What are you doing here?	6	8
I was just looking for a serving plate.	6	8
I was gonna make your daddy's favorite.	6	8
You know, he loves fried chicken.	6	8
I bet you do, too.	6	8
Ooh, you sure look like him.	6	8
No one said you were coming.	6	8
Well, I think I was supposed to be a surprise for you.	6	8
And your daddy said I could visit	6	8
and he gave me a key.	6	8
I thought nobody was home.	6	8
Come over here and give a hug	6	8
to your Grandma Ida.	6	8
Now don't you be rude to me.	6	8
Is that how you was raised to speak to your betters?	6	8
No.	6	8
I'm gonna fix you some eggs.	6	8
And you're gonna sit down and you're gonna eat 'em.	6	8
But first, you're gonna tell me who else in the house.	6	8
How come you don't know?	6	8
I haven't talked to your daddy in a long time.	6	8
And he want to surprise me, too.	6	8
I've never heard of you.	6	8
Your daddy Mr. Donald Draper or not?	6	8
You come over here and give me some sugar.	6	8

My little brothers are here.	6	8
Well, there's no need to wake them.	6	8

No, I'm 14.	6	8
My name is Sally Draper.	6	8
Hello?	6	8
Yes, sir.	6	8
These children ought to be in bed	6	8

Yes, sir. They played a joke on both of us.	6	8

There's entertainment and you stick the ad	6	8

It's a bargain.	6	8
They're getting the entertainment for free.	6	8

What if they're suddenly bored of the entertainment?	6	8
What if they don't... what if they turn off the TV?	6	8
- You gotta get your foot in the door. - Exactly!	6	8
So, how do I do that?	6	8
Let's say I get her face to face.	6	8
How do I capture her imagination?	6	8
I have a sentence, maybe two.	6	8

Some elderly Negro woman held your children hostage	6	8

She robbed a bunch of places in the building	6	8
and she came in here.	6	8

No.	6	8

when I came home to that.	6	8
I'm surprised we didn't all faint.	6	8

I've just been working too much.	6	8
I'm... I'm so embarrassed.	6	8
I acted like a stupid little kid.	6	8
No, you didn't.	6	8
And I'm sure she's fooled plenty of adults, too.	6	8
She said she knew you.	6	8
I asked her everything I know	6	8
and she had an answer for everything.	6	8
Then I realized I don't know anything about you.	6	8

Who?	6	8
Wendy.	6	8
Believe me, it's a lot better than what could have happened	6	8

Well, that's not what her mother thinks.	6	8

That's all I can do right now.	6	8
Call me around 1970	6	8

What are you talking about? I can't do this by myself.	6	8
I'm sorry, Ted.	6	8

Previously on Mad Men...	6	9
You're going to have a love scene.	6	9
And between you, me and soon a national audience,	6	9
it's more of a love affair.	6	9
Oh, my goodness.	6	9
I don't want to live on the Upper East Side.	6	9
Why?	6	9
I saw us raising our kids in a place with more different kinds of people.	6	9
We created a human life.	6	9
When you told me about the merger,	6	9
I hoped he would rub off on you.	6	9
 Obviously, you're on his side.	6	9
Why did you do it all off their sides?	6	9
It tastes better because it's more expensive.	6	9
It's the premium brand and it's priced accordingly.	6	9
Price is irrelevant because the question is	6	9
does it taste better than butter?	6	9
Butter is actually fresh. Margarine is indestructible.	6	9
He's right because he's only comparing different margarines	6	9
and margarine has a 70% market share over butter.	6	9
But it's hard to say any brand is luxury	6	9
when although Fleischmann's is the most expensive	6	9
and Blue Bonnet, owned by the same company,	6	9
is the least expensive, the difference is only pennies.	6	9
45 cents a pound is the highest.	6	9
 29 is the lowest. That's 50% more expensive.	6	9
Fleischmann's is Chivas Regal.	6	9
Still half the price of butter.	6	9
- It's Budweiser. - But what's the market share?	6	9
I just said it's much higher than butter.	6	9
Seeing as I have the ear of the client,	6	9
it's my recommendation we go on taste alone.	6	9
Peggy!	6	9
Don, I agree with you.	6	9
You're in the market buying margarine.	6	9
Okay.	6	9
What goes through your mind?	6	9
Mouthwatering, savory, delicious taste?	6	9
Or mouthwatering, savory, delicious taste and price?	6	9
I'd buy the cheaper one.	6	9
There's one for 45 cents a pound and one for 29.	6	9
Which one do you think is gonna taste better?	6	9
It's a terrible gamble to tell a client that their product is expensive.	6	9
Shh. Let her answer.	6	9
I don't know.	6	9
They both sound good.	6	9
Really?	6	9
Does everyone agree with yours?	6	9
It's not his and mine. Everyone has an opinion.	6	9
We haven't heard it, but I'm sure they do.	6	9
I like Don's.	6	9
What did Harry say?	6	9
I feel strongly both ways.	6	9
They're both so good.	6	9
I'd probably ask someone to run them by the client on the sly.	6	9
The meeting's tomorrow.	6	9
You know what, Don? Let's go with yours.	6	9
Nah, I'm not even gonna be there.	6	9
You should go with whatever you're most comfortable with.	6	9
Could you get me another copy of that research?	6	9
I want to make it big on a board.	6	9
Did you see that? He didn't even turn around.	6	9
- Yep. - Oh, it speaks.	6	9
Come on, I wasn't gonna get in the middle of that.	6	9
You suddenly dumber than Peggy?	6	9
So you're content in silence?	6	9
I'm content with reality.	6	9
You know what this place looks like to the outside world?	6	9
A mess. We don't even have a name.	6	9
- We're the '27 Yankees. - Says who?	6	9
Pete, you want to get your balls tickled?	6	9
Go see a headhunter.	6	9
Are you leaving?	6	9
Look, when things settle down, I'm gonna be a partner.	6	9
For the time being, it's nice to know that the water's warm out there.	6	9
Did you lose something?	6	9
Yes.	6	9
I was looking for...	6	9
how do you say, a pen to write something down.	6	9
Oh, well, the desk is littered with them.	6	9
Would you like a drink?	6	9
Certainly, Colette.	6	9
Although this is my husband's office.	6	9
I should be offering you one.	6	9
It is no trouble at all.	6	9
We're a lot alike.	6	9
We're both interested in things that belong to me.	6	9
I don't know what you're talking about.	6	9
I don't know what your relationship is	6	9
with my husband, but it's over.	6	9
Cut. Let's clean up in there and back up.	6	9
Megan, sweetheart, what are you doing on the floor?	6	9
The script said to spill the drink.	6	9
It doesn't say to clean it up.	6	9
I just thought...	6	9
Your sister Corinne is the maid.	6	9
You're Colette right now. She's blonde, classy.	6	9
We need you to make these women different, honey.	6	9
Let's take it from the top, ladies.	6	9
Don't worry about it.	6	9
I think Phyllis left for the day, but I never saw the boards for tomorrow.	6	9
- Stan has them. - Ah.	6	9
- What are you working on? - Royal Hawaiian.	6	9
- How's that going? - I'm sure you will tell me.	6	9
I will.	6	9
I'll look at it very carefully	6	9
and then I'll formulate an educated opinion.	6	9
You should try it sometime. It's what professionals do.	6	9
Don.	6	9
You've been debating that for weeks.	6	9
- You both have a point. - I'm not paying you to be a diplomat.	6	9
Well, you're both more experienced than me.	6	9
I don't know that my opinion matters.	6	9
Your opinion matters.	6	9
Now what do you think is the best way to go?	6	9
- It's somewhere in the middle. - No, Peggy.	6	9
There's a right and there's a wrong.	6	9
How could that be?	6	9
What you're really saying is there's you and there's him.	6	9
And I don't know how I became in charge of turning this into a collaboration.	6	9
Isn't that your job?	6	9
You're both demanding and you're both pigheaded.	6	9
You're the same person sometimes.	6	9
The difference is that he's interested in the idea	6	9
and you're interested in your idea.	6	9
He's interested in his idea. Don't let him fool you.	6	9
Well, he never makes me feel this way.	6	9
He doesn't know you.	6	9
Henry said you were leaving.	6	9
He just had to make one phone call,	6	9
which turned out to be two.	6	9
Full house, I see.	6	9
He should be off in a minute.	6	9
Well, he's a lucky man. But not as lucky as me,	6	9
because I wanted to be alone with you all night.	6	9
He'll be out in a minute.	6	9
I don't think you heard.	6	9
I want to be alone with you all night.	6	9
Mr. Dell, I have three children.	6	9
I don't care.	6	9
No, look at me.	6	9
Can you believe I've had three children?	6	9
How was your evening, Stew?	6	9
Raised a lot of money.	6	9
Darling, shall we?	6	9
- What's going on? - There was an incident.	6	9
Oh, my God!	6	9
- They hurt you. - I'm fine, honey.	6	9
He was getting off the subway and two guys stabbed him.	6	9
- What? - Hey, I don't want to worry her, man.	6	9
I'm sorry, but I'm trying to get it straight.	6	9
And, frankly, she should know so she can keep up her defense.	6	9
- Jesus, what happened? - Are we done here?	6	9
For a reporter, this is missing detail.	6	9
And if you'd waited at the hospital,	6	9
as you were instructed, we'd be done.	6	9
But for some reason you didn't.	6	9
I filled out the form.	6	9
Come on, were they colored or Puerto Rican?	6	9
Or white?	6	9
I'm from Brooklyn and I always keep my eyes down.	6	9
Could you describe the shoes?	6	9
Look, both of us have done our civic duty.	6	9
So, respectfully, I think you should go.	6	9
I'd get one of these.	6	9
Good evening, ma'am.	6	9
Can you believe those questions?	6	9
- Fascist pig! - Shut up, Abe!	6	9
You don't know what they look like?	6	9
You have a photographic memory.	6	9
Peg, I'm not gonna give him an excuse	6	9
to shake down every kid that walks through this neighborhood.	6	9
What about the one that stabbed you?	6	9
This is a fucking police state	6	9
and we're gonna have to fight, okay?	6	9
They did it in Prague. They did it in Paris.	6	9
And, believe it or not, we're gonna have to do it here, too.	6	9
That doesn't mean protecting criminals.	6	9
Listen, baby, it's my right to tell whomever whatever I want.	6	9
But you can keep talking because everything you say is going in my story.	6	9
What are you talking about?	6	9
It's just fascinating, the attitudes I'm encountering.	6	9
But why would you side with the cops?	6	9
I don't know.	6	9
I read about this.	6	9
You obviously had a traumatic experience	6	9
not unlike combat.	6	9
So I'm going to let you do whatever you're doing.	6	9
Don't patronize me.	6	9
Those kids have no other recourse in this system.	6	9
- They're animals. - They were brought here by slave ships.	6	9
Well, I was brought here by you.	6	9
I don't care if I take a loss, I'm gonna sell this shithole.	6	9
You're worried about me and I love you for it.	6	9
Now, I don't think I can type with this thing.	6	9
Get my Olympia. Help me get some of this down.	6	9
I'm going to bed.	6	9
This is nice.	6	9
It's Thursday. Told you I was making dinner.	6	9
Sit down.	6	9
How was your day?	6	9
How was yours?	6	9
Hmm.	6	9
It was...	6	9
Ugh, it was terrible.	6	9
I don't even know if I want to talk about it.	6	9
What's for dinner?	6	9
I think they hate me.	6	9
They just gave you a second part.	6	9
I feel like an idiot because they keep telling me	6	9
they can't tell the twins apart.	6	9
I think I'm playing them very differently.	6	9
It's not like it's never been done before.	6	9
Exactly.	6	9
I told Mel I didn't want to be a cliché.	6	9
Then he starts rapping about how they're two halves of the same person	6	9
and they want the same thing, but they're trying to get it in different ways.	6	9
Listen, would you mind if we just go in and turn on the set?	6	9
I'm really not hungry.	6	9
Did you have a bad day?	6	9
I'm just tired.	6	9
Go lay down. I'll clean up.	6	9
I already packed your bag for Bobby's camp.	6	9
Tomorrow's another day.	6	9
John, could you give us some privacy?	6	9
Was the evening a success?	6	9
You tell me.	6	9
Well, I--	6	9
I found it fascinating as usual	6	9
watching you work your magic.	6	9
And while you were watching me,	6	9
everyone was watching you, weren't they?	6	9
Stewart did everything but grab your ass.	6	9
I didn't notice.	6	9
What did he say to you?	6	9
I don't want to get anyone in trouble.	6	9
Word for word.	6	9
He said he wanted to be alone with me.	6	9
What else?	6	9
All night.	6	9
Daddy, I don't want him running on the steps.	6	9
Why not? Kids are supposed to run.	6	9
Ellery, come down.	6	9
We don't have any steps in the apartment.	6	9
He's not good at them.	6	9
So what do you think, girls?	6	9
See any resemblance?	6	9
He's very handsome.	6	9
So, Ellery, take a good look.	6	9
Who's your type?	6	9
Hello, Margaret.	6	9
I'll tell you mine later.	6	9
It's nice to see you.	6	9
Oh, he's precious. How old is he?	6	9
He's four. He's having a special day with Pop-pop.	6	9
We're going to the zoo and maybe the movies.	6	9
So it's just a regular workday.	6	9
Don't fill him full of junk.	6	9
Can't promise that.	6	9
Wave good-bye, swabby.	6	9
We're shoving off.	6	9
How many times have you met with Harry?	6	9
Too many. Don't waste my time like Crane.	6	9
I'm a headhunter, not a fan club.	6	9
Fine, let's talk about me.	6	9
Let's talk about Burt Peterson.	6	9
I got him a vice presidency at McCann.	6	9
If he keeps his head down, he's set for life.	6	9
But the merger was fresh. I don't know your situation.	6	9
You weren't very straight on the phone.	6	9
You think they're gonna cut you loose?	6	9
How come you didn't get yourself a job?	6	9
That's a Yankee wrinkle.	6	9
- You interested in my business? - No.	6	9
Well, if we sat down a couple of months ago,	6	9
this would have been a different conversation.	6	9
Nothing's changed. I'll show you my Rolodex.	6	9
It's not that. It's your lack of a role in the management structure.	6	9
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce Cutler Gleason and Chaough?	6	9
Who the hell's in charge?	6	9
Two of those men are as dead as doornails.	6	9
There's still a lot of chiefs and only a couple of Indians.	6	9
And a lot of questions.	6	9
What the hell happened with Vicks?	6	9
So...	6	9
paint me a new portrait.	6	9
I'm glad you said that.	6	9
How about seeing things from the client side?	6	9
There's a head of marketing job in Wichita that you'd be perfect for.	6	9
Anything back here on Earth?	6	9
You know,	6	9
I've always liked you, Campbell,	6	9
so forgive me for saying this,	6	9
but if you do a little better, I can do a lot better.	6	9
I don't know what else I can do.	6	9
I've been you	6	9
and I went on interviews	6	9
and I realized I was filling the room with desperation.	6	9
Five cents worth of free advice.	6	9
You've got to spend less time in this place	6	9
and more at home.	6	9
This is a reluctant necessity.	6	9
My mother's run amok.	6	9
Pete, one day I looked in the mirror	6	9
and I realized I had regrets because I didn't understand	6	9
the wellspring of my confidence.	6	9
Gin?	6	9
My family.	6	9
My family is a constant distraction.	6	9
You better manage that	6	9
or you're not gonna manage anything.	6	9
Hey, buddy.	6	9
Can you help me?	6	9
I'm occupied at the moment, sir.	6	9
Hello there.	6	9
Oh. Are you lost, too?	6	9
Not yet.	6	9
I'm trying to get some gas.	6	9
Lady asked for directions.	6	9
Fill 'er up with regular.	6	9
Where's Henry?	6	9
He's coming tomorrow.	6	9
I'm surprised you were able to get away.	6	9
Where are you staying?	6	9
Somewhere over here.	6	9
Just go down here. Stay on here a mile and a half	6	9
till you get to the big mill. Make a left.	6	9
Go back through town till the railroad tracks.	6	9
Hang a right over the bridge	6	9
and then you come to the little mill.	6	9
Do any of the roads have names?	6	9
Follow me.	6	9
Fleischmann's just called.	6	9
See? You were worried for nothing.	6	9
Well, they just requested some more recent figures on market share.	6	9
I'll handle it.	6	9
Peggy, may I speak with you? Go ahead.	6	9
What the hell were you doing back there?	6	9
You didn't want me to talk.	6	9
I didn't talk. That was the plan. Did you want me to talk?	6	9
- No, you touched my hand. - What?	6	9
When you handed me the board.	6	9
What? No, I didn't.	6	9
Yes, you did. And you can't do that in a presentation.	6	9
I doubt anyone saw that because I didn't even know I did it.	6	9
It jarred me. And when I finally caught up, then you smiled.	6	9
You can't smile at me like that.	6	9
I never should have kissed you.	6	9
I assumed we were forgetting about that.	6	9
I forgot it.	6	9
Well, I haven't.	6	9
Oh.	6	9
What an old tune.	6	9
The boss in love with his protégé.	6	9
Is this all me? Because that'll help.	6	9
I think about it.	6	9
Well, we can't. I have someone, you have someone.	6	9
And believe me, I've considered it a lot further than that.	6	9
I didn't know you felt this way.	6	9
I don't want to, that's the point.	6	9
Now I realize I never should have brought it up.	6	9
Do you want me to work someplace else?	6	9
No.	6	9
Of course not.	6	9
Come on, you have to do it.	6	9
And the left.	6	9

Daddy, you came!	6	9
You didn't tell him I was here?	6	9
I wanted it to be a surprise.	6	9
You catch any fish?	6	9
Damn it, I made you a wallet, but it's back in my cabin.	6	9
Bobby, language.	6	9
We'll get it later.	6	9
Mommy said we can have anything we want.	6	9
Hi!	6	9
This is my mom and dad.	6	9
That's Bobby Two. He's shy.	6	9
Are you Bobby or Bobby One?	6	9
I'm Bobby Five.	6	9
It's sad. There's no Bobby One anymore.	6	9
Because of Bobby Kennedy?	6	9
No, he went home.	6	9
Do you want me to get the waitress so you can get a drink?	6	9
- Is that possible? - No.	6	9
Mommy's having a chef salad and I'm having a cheeseburger.	6	9
What do you want so I can order?	6	9
What's good here?	6	9
I'm afraid nothing.	6	9

Can I walk you out?	6	9
Certainly, if you don't mind waiting.	6	9
I need your advice.	6	9
And, well, it's of a personal nature	6	9
and thus above Clara's security clearance.	6	9
How can I help you?	6	9
Do you feel my attention to business has been diluted?	6	9
How personal is this conversation?	6	9
I'm being pulled in a million directions.	6	9
My wife, my child, my mother.	6	9
I can't solve those problems, Pete.	6	9
I have those problems.	6	9
I live with my mother.	6	9
Has your mother exhausted every nursing agency?	6	9
No, but she's exhausted me.	6	9
Well...	6	9
the options are my home and a home,	6	9
neither of which will make me feel better.	6	9
I am sorry to hear that.	6	9
- Do you want to get supper? - I can't. I have plans.	6	9
Thank you, Joan.	6	9
- For what? - I don't know.	6	9
Welcome.	6	9
Oh, I'm a little damp.	6	9
Did it finally rain?	6	9
No, but I walked. This was cold when I left.	6	9
You walked from the West Side?	6	9
What an incredible space.	6	9
Did you do this yourself?	6	9
Oh, I had a little help.	6	9
Arlene, you read about the shootings in the park, didn't you?	6	9
I'm not gonna let a few lunatics	6	9
ruin a gorgeous night like this.	6	9
Should I go get my script?	6	9
Megan, darling,	6	9
you're a good actress	6	9
on your way to becoming, well,	6	9
at least a successful one.	6	9
There's nothing I can tell you about that script.	6	9
I came over here because I'm worried about you.	6	9
Am I gonna get fired?	6	9
I remember my first job.	6	9
Believe it or not, in radio.	6	9
"""Against the Storm."""	6	9
Very classy, a lot of big words, high morals.	6	9
And my agent, who I later learned	6	9
was angling to sign Roger DeKoven,	6	9
told me my voice was childish.	6	9
And every day I would vacillate between	6	9
"""Arlene, you're wonderful"" and ""Arlene, you're caca."""	6	9
Which was it?	6	9
Honestly?	6	9
I was wonderful.	6	9
You should go inside.	6	9
You'll get eaten alive out here.	6	9
You know mosquitos ignore me.	6	9
In those shorts?	6	9
Did you find a bottle?	6	9
Maybe.	6	9
Cheers.	6	9
I loved camp.	6	9
I never went.	6	9
Yes, you did.	6	9
Remember when we went to Lake Champlain with my parents?	6	9
I remember.	6	9
And you got in a horrible fight with my father	6	9
about who would carry the luggage.	6	9
And then we went in the woods and made Sally.	6	9
I don't understand her.	6	9
Henry says she's a lot like you.	6	9
How would he know?	6	9
He says she reminds him of you.	6	9
I think she's a lot like you.	6	9
Bobby reminds me of my father.	6	9
So bossy.	6	9
All the teenagers of the world are in revolt.	6	9
What were we like?	6	9
You and me?	6	9
When I saw you earlier today	6	9
"I thought for a second, ""Who is that man?"""	6	9
And I forgot how mad I was at you.	6	9
Ugh, I don't know what's happened, but I'm all bit up.	6	9
Close the door. You'll let the bugs in.	6	9
What are you doing?	6	9
Waiting for you to tell me to stop.	6	9
What did you think when you saw me?	6	9
That you are as beautiful as the day I met you.	6	9
So finally I said to Mel,	6	9
"""I'm either his mother or his girlfriend. I can't be both."""	6	9
That's bad writing.	6	9
You're so lucky he's at work.	6	9
Please, dear, that's a complex relationship.	6	9
But he understands what you do	6	9
and he wants you to be great.	6	9
And he's always proud of you. I've seen it.	6	9
Don's very proud of you.	6	9
You can tell by how protective he is.	6	9
It's been so different.	6	9
You know, we worked together and I left to pursue this.	6	9
And he was so encouraging.	6	9
And then you started succeeding.	6	9
He's old-fashioned.	6	9
He'll get used to it.	6	9
I think he did.	6	9
And I think he got used to me not being around	6	9
and having a bunch of problems that he couldn't solve.	6	9
And I don't know	6	9
if it's him or me, but...	6	9
I feel so lonely.	6	9
Arlene.	6	9
What?	6	9
I want to make you feel better.	6	9
This isn't the way.	6	9
Forget it.	6	9
I can't believe you.	6	9
I'm trusting you and you're taking advantage of every private moment.	6	9
Well, what was I supposed to think?	6	9
You invited me over.	6	9
Your husband's not here.	6	9
Two bottles of wine to go over a scene	6	9
a child could understand.	6	9
"""I'm so lonely."""	6	9
I work with you and your husband is my boss.	6	9
And now what am I supposed to do?	6	9
Am I gonna be punished for not doing something	6	9
that you won't stop trying to do?	6	9
Megan, it's okay to say no.	6	9
But you don't have to embarrass me.	6	9
I'm sorry.	6	9
I didn't mean to.	6	9
No, stop it.	6	9
You're a tease.	6	9
Fine.	6	9
No, I'm fine with being a tease.	6	9
Well, honey,	6	9
just learn the lines.	6	9
Two characters is tough, but you know what Olivier says,	6	9
let the wig do the work.	6	9
I'm gonna go before I--	6	9
well, it's too late for that, isn't it?	6	9
Thank you for that.	6	9
No hard feelings.	6	9
Status quo ante bellum.	6	9
Everything as it was.	6	9
I missed you.	6	9
Do you feel guilty?	6	9
No.	6	9
This happened a long time ago.	6	9
Ugh, menthols.	6	9
I don't miss that.	6	9
Is this what it would have been like if we'd stayed together?	6	9
I don't think about that anymore.	6	9
I'm happy in my life.	6	9
Let's just enjoy this.	6	9
But you used to?	6	9
What are you thinking right now?	6	9
I'm thinking about how different you are,	6	9
before and after.	6	9
I love the way you look at me when you're like this.	6	9
But then I watch it decay.	6	9
I can only hold your attention so long.	6	9
Why is sex	6	9
the definition of being close to someone?	6	9
I don't know,	6	9
but it is for me.	6	9
It is for most people.	6	9
Just because you climb a mountain doesn't mean you love it.	6	9
Climbing a mountain?	6	9
Is that what making love is to you?	6	9
If we'd lied here together with you in my arms,	6	9
I would have felt just as close.	6	9
Not the rest of it. I don't know.	6	9
I don't know.	6	9
It doesn't mean that much to me.	6	9
Is it the same with Megan?	6	9
Why do you want to talk about that?	6	9
That poor girl.	6	9
She doesn't know that loving you	6	9
is the worst way to get to you.	6	9
Are you sure you don't want to just hold me?	6	9
Oh, Jesus.	6	9
Oh, thank God. What are you doing in here?	6	9
I was just fixing the window.	6	9
What the hell happened here?	6	9
I'll replace it tomorrow when I get back from work.	6	9
Because you're leaving me here	6	9
after someone threw a rock through our window?	6	9
That's not what happened.	6	9
Well, I came in here and there's glass all over the floor	6	9
and you're holding a rock.	6	9
I'm tired of being interrogated in my own home.	6	9
Do you think they saw you talking to the police?	6	9
If you're gonna let your imagination run wild,	6	9
come to the paper with me tonight.	6	9
Abe, I have to go to work tomorrow.	6	9
And this is our bedroom.	6	9
Someone was in our yard.	6	9
I'm really scared here.	6	9
And you're going to protect me? You only have one hand.	6	9
You're right. You're right.	6	9
We'll start looking. Put it on the market.	6	9
You'd really do that for me?	6	9
Maybe we're not cut out to be pioneers.	6	9
Sleep in the parlor if you're worried. I won't wake you.	6	9
Hello?	6	9
"You took a four-year-old to see ""Planet of the Apes""?"	6	9
He's been having nightmares all night.	6	9
Hold on, hold on.	6	9
He wanted to see that.	6	9
He doesn't decide that.	6	9
Well, Don took his kid.	6	9
Don Draper, Father of the Year.	6	9
Margaret, honey, he loved it.	6	9
Put him on, I'll do Dr. Zaius again. He laughs like an idiot.	6	9
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise.	6	9
You're not funny, Daddy.	6	9
We'll probably have to get rid of the dog; he's that afraid of fur.	6	9
"Listen, I saw ""The Golem"" when I was his age."	6	9
You don't even know what scary is.	6	9
I was fine. It's not my fault.	6	9
Yeah, you're right. It's my fault.	6	9
For letting you talk me into having a four-year-old	6	9
watch another four-year-old.	6	9
Listen to me, young lady, you calm down this minute.	6	9
No, Daddy, you listen to me.	6	9
You can keep up your fantasy of acting like a father,	6	9
but your grandfather days are done.	6	9
I'm sorry you're upset. I'm coming over.	6	9
- I'll calm him down. - No.	6	9
And call Mother next time you want to see him	6	9
'cause she has to be there.	6	9
- Morning. - Good morning.	6	9
Good to see you.	6	9
It's such a project going to the beach.	6	9
Can I go get Kevin?	6	9
Let him sleep a little more.	6	9
I'd love to get one of those summer rentals.	6	9
Doesn't Pete Campbell have a beach house?	6	9
I wouldn't ask him for anything.	6	9
- Don't you like him? - It's not that.	6	9
Actually, he's the only person there	6	9
who's never broken a promise to me.	6	9
He's a very generous person.	6	9
And frankly, I think he's having a rough time.	6	9
So he told you about his mother?	6	9
No, I wish he would have. What's wrong?	6	9
He needs a nurse.	6	9
He's not gonna ask you. He's too ashamed.	6	9
She back from the track already?	6	9
Ugh, she must have forgotten her keys.	6	9
Oh, hello, Roger.	6	9
- Who are you? - It's me, Bob Benson.	6	9
From the office.	6	9
What are you doing here?	6	9
Oh, I was out shopping	6	9
and I realized I had misplaced some paperwork.	6	9
And I, uh--	6	9
what are you two doing?	6	9
We're leaving for the beach.	6	9
- You know what? I should go get the car. - Good idea.	6	9
No, Mr. Sterling is just leaving.	6	9
Roger, I'm sure this can wait till Monday.	6	9
Sure, absolutely. Sorry about that, Bob.	6	9
I guess we're all a little bit out of context right now.	6	9
I take no offense.	6	9
Didn't know you were friends.	6	9
Some people never stop working.	6	9
I'm going to freshen up and we'll get out of here.	6	9
Hey, get off our lawn!	6	9
What's going on?	6	9
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!	6	9
Jesus!	6	9
Why didn't you say something?	6	9
- What do I do? - Don't pull it out.	6	9
- If I don't make it-- - Stop it.	6	9
You're going to make it. He's going to make it.	6	9
Look, I don't want you to think this is about what you did.	6	9
It was an accident. I feel horrible.	6	9
No, you're scared.	6	9
You're a scared person who hides behind complacence--	6	9
cy.	6	9
Save your strength. You're not making any sense.	6	9
I don't know why I thought you'd be braver.	6	9
You're... in advertising.	6	9
Don't do this right now. I said I was sorry.	6	9
Your activities are offensive to my every waking moment.	6	9
I'm sorry...	6	9
but you'll always be the enemy.	6	9
Are you breaking up with me?	6	9
Got to hand it to you.	6	9
You gave me a great ending to my article.	6	9
Oh, you're back.	6	9
Did you have fun?	6	9
I missed you.	6	9
Well, I miss you all the time.	6	9
I don't know when I started pretending like everything was sunny.	6	9
I don't know where you've gone,	6	9
but I'm here.	6	9
I keep trying to make things the way they used to be,	6	9
but I don't know how.	6	9
And maybe that's stupid	6	9
or young to think like that, but...	6	9
something has to change.	6	9
Megan...	6	9
You're right.	6	9
I haven't been here.	6	9
Roger, please.	6	9
Come on, just take it.	6	9
They're Lincoln Logs.	6	9
I thought maybe he'd build his mother a house.	6	9
You can't drop in on me like that.	6	9
But I want to.	6	9
Oh, Roger, I'm so sorry,	6	9
but you can't do this.	6	9
Why not?	6	9
Because it's too confusing.	6	9
For Kevin. You know.	6	9
But I'm his father.	6	9
No, his father is Greg.	6	9
But I'm here.	6	9
For now.	6	9
But every day Greg is some hero out there.	6	9
And I'd rather him think that is the man in his life.	6	9
Who's gonna watch TV with him? Bob Bunson?	6	9
I just want to be around.	6	9
I know you want to.	6	9
But I can't count on that.	6	9
Thank you for the gift.	6	9
Something delicate has come to my attention.	6	9
Have a seat.	6	9
I...	6	9
I've really debated whether to bring this up with you	6	9
because I don't want to put you in a strange position	6	9
and in the end it's probably just gossip.	6	9
It's come to my attention	6	9
that you may be in need of a nurse for your mother.	6	9
Joan had no right to tell you that.	6	9
His name is Manolo Colón.	6	9
He's an army-trained registered nurse	6	9
and he's available now only because	6	9
he's brought my father back to full health.	6	9
Is he Spanish from Spain? Because otherwise Mother will refuse.	6	9
He's very well-bred.	6	9
And don't blame Joan.	6	9
She was concerned about you	6	9
and had exhausted her resources	6	9
and is well aware that your well-being	6	9
is also an interest of mine.	6	9
Good morning.	6	9
- Is he in? - Yes, just a minute.	6	9
It's okay.	6	9
Hi. Good morning.	6	9
Good morning.	6	9
I just wanted to--	6	9
I needed to talk to you.	6	9
Peggy, what's wrong?	6	9
I...	6	9
Abe got stabbed.	6	9
My goodness. Is he okay? What happened?	6	9
He's going to be fine.	6	9
But it's over.	6	9
We're done.	6	9
I'm sorry to hear that.	6	9
You are?	6	9
You'll find someone else.	6	9
And whoever he is, he's lucky to have you.	6	9
Thank you.	6	9
You ready to get to work?	6	9
Excuse me?	6	9
It's Monday morning, Peggy. Brand-new week.	6	9
Morning. How was your weekend?	6	9
How'd it go with Fleischmann's?	6	9
They just called. Full speed ahead.	6	9
Good work.	6	9

This convention instructs the Democratic National Committee...	6	10
that it shall include in the call for the 1972 convention...	6	10
the following addition to section one-	6	10
quote, it is the further understanding...	6	10
Should I pack your swim trunks?	6	10
What?	6	10
They're supposed to be debating the war.	6	10
They can debate it all they want, they just can't come out against it.	6	10
Then no one will vote for Humphrey.	6	10
Over Nixon?	6	10
Well, they can't have the whole convention without talking about the war.	6	10
Thirty seconds after prime time, they'll start the debate.	6	10
Cops have been hassling protesters all day.	6	10
Also not in prime time.	6	10
- You're so cynical. - Come over here.	6	10
Come with me. We'll go back to Disneyland.	6	10
From what I remember, something amazing happened there.	6	10
- I made the biggest mistake of my life. - That's true.	6	10
You know I'd come if I could.	6	10
You'll have fun. Just stay away from actresses.	6	10
Do they have them out there?	6	10
I hate actresses.	6	10
Kenny said that this time he went to a floor...	6	10
in the Chevy building he'd never been to before.	6	10
He said it was like Get Smart.	6	10
Just a bunch of doors in procession.	6	10
And he met the man he believes to be the source of our current torture.	6	10
- What's his name? - Same as the rest of them- Jack something.	6	10
Apparently his feelings were hurt because we haven't kissed his ring.	6	10
Well, I'd be happy to go there and help soften him up.	6	10
If anyone's going, I'm going.	6	10
But you can't because you're going to Los Angeles for- What again?	6	10
I'm going to pay them a visit immediately.	6	10
Don't want to miss our flight. Are we going?	6	10
- Right after the partners' meeting. - Oh.	6	10
Are we done here?	6	10
Sweetheart, could you step out?	6	10
This morning I received an envelope addressed to Sterling Gleason and Pryce.	6	10
- From who? - It doesn't matter.	6	10
They don't know our name because we don't know our name.	6	10
Aren't we SCDPCGC?	6	10
Not officially.	6	10
Well, I'm tired of the conversation that goes along with my business card.	6	10
I know that no one has observed the memo that requested specifically...	6	10
that all seven letters be used when answering the phone.	6	10
Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce, Cutler, Gleason and Chaough? It's a mouthful.	6	10
SCDPCGC is a mouthful.	6	10
But CGCSCDP is not.	6	10
- I don't agree. - We've each lost a partner.	6	10
Why don't we each lose a letter?	6	10
SCDC.	6	10
- What do the C's stand for? - Not Campbell.	6	10
- Cooper and Cutler. - Pardon me?	6	10
Well, SCDCC. sounds like a stutter and looks like a typo.	6	10
Very well, if it puts this to rest, I will gladly withdraw my name...	6	10
along with the other deceased parties in this conversation.	6	10
Bert, don't be a martyr.	6	10
Want to throw away both of these brands?	6	10
Just leave it alone. We'll get a bigger front door.	6	10
Well, of course you like it. You're at the front.	6	10
- I'm at the end. - I'm at the end.	6	10
Well, I move to table this. You have fun in Detroit.	6	10
- And you have fun with Manischewitz. - Any special instructions?	6	10
Yeah, the guy in charge, just pick an eye and stick with it.	6	10
Very well, but it's my belief that any further delay...	6	10
in choosing our name will take it out of our hands...	6	10
and leave it up to the world.	6	10
You know Sunkist is still only doing print work?	6	10
I'm cutting you off.	6	10
- You're two ahead of me. - No, from work.	6	10
Come on. We're executives.	6	10
Leave the drudgery to Ted Chaough and the rest of the underlings.	6	10
- Did you prepare at all? - Sunkist, Carnation, the avocado people.	6	10
My biggest job in these meetings...	6	10
"is to keep them from saying ""golly"" too many times."	6	10
Carnation has 27 million in billings.	6	10
I don't think the guy in charge ties his pants with a rope.	6	10
I didn't say that. But I guarantee they all have a certain regard...	6	10
for two gentlemen from the big city.	6	10
- You mean they won't trust us? - I mean they don't trust themselves.	6	10
I don't know if you realize it, but we are big New York admen...	6	10
from an agency with seven letters in its name.	6	10
That means under no circumstances...	6	10
are you to trot out that drawl you do when you've had too many.	6	10
Be slick. Be glib. Be you.	6	10
Well, I'm usually informed.	6	10
We're conquistadors.	6	10
I'm Vasco da Gama, and you're... some other Mexican.	6	10
We're gonna land there, buy whatever they've got for the beads in our pockets.	6	10
Our biggest challenge is to not get syphilis. Cathy.	6	10
Another round. And send one to the pilot.	6	10
... hours of a crimonious debate...	6	10
the Democratic National Convention has rejected a plank...	6	10
advanced by Democratic doves...	6	10
calling for an unconditional end to all bombing of North Vietnam.	6	10
- The discussion was conducted- - What's going on?	6	10
They delayed till noon, and then they rejected it.	6	10
- Rejected what? - The peace plank.	6	10
A chance to have a platform against the war.	6	10
Uh-huh. Then let me clarify my question.	6	10
What's going on with the work for Manischewitz?	6	10
Because you're for the war.	6	10
You know there's 200 body bags every week.	6	10
Figure out how to get into that business yet?	6	10
I refuse to be distracted by events in which I have no actual stake or participation.	6	10
- How could you say that? - Because he doesn't have any sons.	6	10
I served in the Air Force. Did you?	6	10
You're disgusting, you know that?	6	10
This whole thing works because people like you look the other way.	6	10
- Ginsberg. - My politics are private.	6	10
But that presentation isn't.	6	10
Now, are you gonna hide your dawdling behind your outrage?	6	10
You'll have your work, and you know it.	6	10
You can go in there and take credit for it like you always do.	6	10
Be friendly and charming after you've stuck your fascist boot on my neck!	6	10
So I'm a fascist because I gave you a deadline?	6	10
No, you're a fascist because you love business, and you hate everything else-	6	10
freedom, blacks, Jews.	6	10
- This is my stop. - I hate hypocrites.	6	10
Like hippies who cash checks from Dow Chemical and General Motors.	6	10
You rooting for the Soviets in Prague, too, you Nazi?	6	10
Michael, what are you doing? That man is your boss.	6	10
Why are you always down here? Go back upstairs!	6	10
You're a truncheon, Cutler!	6	10
Thanks for making that worse.	6	10
Hello, Ted.	6	10
You busy?	6	10
Extremely.	6	10
I think you know I'm a man without regrets...	6	10
but I do believe we fired the wrong people...	6	10
and I'd like to remedy that immediately.	6	10
Jim, I think you're upset.	6	10
No, because I have a solution.	6	10
I think we should remove the rest of their people...	6	10
while Sterling, Draper and Crane are in California.	6	10
Just lock the gates and leave Pete Campbell as the doorman.	6	10
- What happened? - Do I need cause?	6	10
How about failure to complete tasks coupled with gross insubordination?	6	10
Maybe part of it is you keep seeing this agency...	6	10
as our people and their people.	6	10
Well, how about your people and my people?	6	10
Do I have permission to clean out creative, starting with Mr. Ginsberg?	6	10
Jim, he's lightning in a bottle!	6	10
You have to start holding hands, starting with his.	6	10
Because I'll be in Detroit tomorrow, and you're taking him to Manischewitz.	6	10
Sterling's client and Draper's boy.	6	10
I'm the world's most expensive babysitter.	6	10
That's the spirit.	6	10
I suppose I wouldn't be a good friend if I didn't ask-	6	10
is Kate pulling her weight around there?	6	10
She arranged this.	6	10
She did.	6	10
Well, Kate told me that you're the kind of woman...	6	10
who won't just tell me what I want to hear.	6	10
I hope she didn't make any promises.	6	10
My wife always says I'm the kind of man who doesn't like to ask for directions.	6	10
My new job has me face-to-face with ad agencies.	6	10
I don't know what I'm doing.	6	10
Kate said you were divorced.	6	10
I am. I forgot.	6	10
What does that say?	6	10
Anyway, what should I look for in an agency?	6	10
Oh, well, a good agency should tell you.	6	10
Go ahead.	6	10
Me?	6	10
That's why I'm here.	6	10
Yes.	6	10
Of course.	6	10
Well, I suppose we don't just lean on stylish creative and market research.	6	10
We listen to the client.	6	10
Doesn't everybody do that?	6	10
Despite your modesty, you already know...	6	10
that the way to get invited into people's homes is through their TV sets.	6	10
Media placement is part science, part courage.	6	10
Anyone can tell you not to run makeup ads during football.	6	10
The trick is finding your customers in places you hadn't thought to look.	6	10
Harry Crane is a wizard.	6	10
They use a computer the size of this restaurant.	6	10
And what is your job there?	6	10
I'm in charge of thinking of things before people know they need them.	6	10
- I've got this. - Come on.	6	10
Please, this is what I get paid to do.	6	10
I was just coming to see you.	6	10
- But you're not going anywhere. - I was, but then you appeared.	6	10
At the risk of playing defense...	6	10
I only interfered because I hate disrespect.	6	10
I don't know what you're talking about.	6	10
- Neither do I. - Hmm.	6	10
I believe in you, Bob. But you're untested.	6	10
Manischewitz, tomorrow afternoon- think you can handle the parties involved?	6	10
Michael Ginsberg or the clients?	6	10
I don't see much difference, do you?	6	10
I think I can keep the volume down.	6	10
Excellent.	6	10
I welcome this chance to shine.	6	10
Hmm.	6	10
- Are you on a deadline? - No, do you need me?	6	10
- I need a drink. - Okay.	6	10
I had this lunch my friend Kate set up, and I think it's a potential client.	6	10
- I know he is. - Who is he?	6	10
The new head of marketing at Avon.	6	10
I thought it was a date, but it turned out to be better.	6	10
- I love Avon. - Of course.	6	10
And you'd be perfect for it.	6	10
It's just- I don't know what to do with it. He's leaving town tomorrow.	6	10
So set a meeting.	6	10
I know I have to, but Don's not here...	6	10
and I don't want to get kicked off the diving board.	6	10
We'll take it to Ted. He'll know what to do.	6	10
- What did I just say? - He's not like that.	6	10
- And what do I ask for? - I don't know.	6	10
You'll be the account man if that's what you want.	6	10
Trust me, he loves new business.	6	10
He doesn't care where it comes from. Let's go.	6	10
- I told you I wanted a rental car. - They insisted.	6	10
- Ted, do you have a minute? - Just barely.	6	10
Well, it's kind of urgent. Joan has a solid lead.	6	10
He's leaving tomorrow. We need to set a meeting.	6	10
Good for you. Get Pete Campbell down here.	6	10
- Who is it? - It's Avon Cosmetics.	6	10
Very groovy.	6	10
The new head of marketing, he's a friend of a very close friend of mine...	6	10
and I just wanted to introduce him to Peggy.	6	10
- Peggy'd be perfect for it. - You rang?	6	10
- Pete, as head of new business- - Since when? I don't want that.	6	10
Joan has a lead for Avon Cosmetics.	6	10
Peggy's creative. He's leaving town tomorrow. Reel him in.	6	10
Fly safe.	6	10
Avon Cosmetics.	6	10
That's Fortune 500. What's his name?	6	10
Andy Hayes.	6	10
My friend Kate just moved there from Mary Kay, and she sent him my way.	6	10
Tell me everything you can about him and set lunch tomorrow for Peggy and me.	6	10
I should be there.	6	10
Joan, this is how things get botched.	6	10
First, account man and creative.	6	10
Then if all goes well, next trip...	6	10
he visits the office, and you show him around.	6	10
I think he'll be expecting me.	6	10
Shouldn't Joan make the introductions?	6	10
I don't understand what the problem is.	6	10
You're going to make the call...	6	10
and tell him how important I am, and how exciting Peggy is.	6	10
And then we're going to tell him how essential you are.	6	10
Don't worry. You'll get all the credit.	6	10
Clara. Are you coming?	6	10
Geez. Hey, I let you sit up front.	6	10
Sorry about that. You need a hand?	6	10
What?	6	10
There's no one from G.M. in Los Angeles?	6	10
- Get rid of that car. - And get us something with a roof.	6	10
Don't want to show up to a meeting with bugs in my teeth.	6	10
So, you want to take a dip in the pool or should I just wait in the bar?	6	10
- Both have attractive scenery. - Where's the bellman?	6	10
Mañana, Don. Everything's mañana here.	6	10
Need to take a shower. You can wait in the bar if you want.	6	10
- I'm gonna get room service. - We're gonna go to the Sunset Strip...	6	10
- Watch a girl dance in a cage. - That you heard?	6	10
Save your strength for tomorrow.	6	10
Going to a party in the hills.	6	10
- It's very hip. - Beverly Hills?	6	10
No, the hills. And it's movies, not TV.	6	10
My friend in development at CBS says it's going to be crawling with moguls.	6	10
- Geez, it's hot here. - It's a dry heat.	6	10
It's a dry heave.	6	10
Come on, Don. Let's go to the Strip right now and get some dinner.	6	10
No, I'm gonna turn in.	6	10
Tried to sleep on the plane, but somebody wouldn't stop talking.	6	10
Don't worry, I got this.	6	10
This is on tape since again we're not able to cover it live.	6	10
The tape you're about to see was made about 30 to 40 minutes ago.	6	10
It was supposed to be a nonviolent demonstration today.	6	10
And one will never know what it was that made it become violent.	6	10
This is directly in front of what advertises itself...	6	10
as the world's largest and friendliest hotel.	6	10
Where at this hour people stand around...	6	10
and sit in their rooms with handkerchiefs...	6	10
- Hello. - Are you watching this?	6	10
Yeah.	6	10
It's hard to believe no one got killed.	6	10
Is that the only measure?	6	10
Can you imagine a policeman cracking your skull?	6	10
It would change your whole life.	6	10
Honey, they're throwing rocks.	6	10
They're prepared for trouble.	6	10
In some places, plain clothes men are helping make the arrests.	6	10
On the bright side, Conrad Hilton is probably in that hotel right now.	6	10
Don't make jokes.	6	10
Megan, you can't even vote.	6	10
But I live here.	6	10
I'm sorry.	6	10
I want you to be careful.	6	10
This could easily start a riot.	6	10
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.	6	10
Really?	6	10
You can if you want to.	6	10
I miss you.	6	10
Go for a swim.	6	10
It always makes you feel better.	6	10
The whole world is watching.	6	10
The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching.	6	10
There's a break in the arrests now-	6	10
We should hang up. This is costing a fortune.	6	10
Try and get some sleep.	6	10
You too.	6	10
- They're now moving down Balboa Street. - Bye.	6	10
Bye.	6	10
So you came after all.	6	10
Pete couldn't make it.	6	10
What? How the hell are we supposed to do this?	6	10
Don't worry about it. Coffee, please.	6	10
I didn't know Ted was going to handle it that way.	6	10
Well, he did.	6	10
And Pete's not coming...	6	10
because he wasn't invited.	6	10
- You can't do that. - I did it.	6	10
If you want to leave, go ahead.	6	10
I hope I didn't keep you waiting, but I was trying to check out.	6	10
See, if you were a client, you could have left your key at the desk...	6	10
and we would have attended to that.	6	10
Andy Hayes, Peggy Olson.	6	10
She's the dynamite in our creative department.	6	10
I don't know about that.	6	10
Tomato juice and coffee, please.	6	10
I didn't want you to leave New York without meeting Peggy.	6	10
Her expertise has been honed by her work on Clearasil...	6	10
Pond's Cold Cream, and most relevant, Belle Jolie lipsticks.	6	10
I almost worked there.	6	10
"- Do you remember ""Mark your man""? - I do."	6	10
I grew up in an Avon home.	6	10
Our lady was Gladys Bowman.	6	10
She was very elegant.	6	10
My mother would vacuum the drapes before she came.	6	10
Then my sister and I would fight over the catalog.	6	10
- In fact- - In fact, all women...	6	10
have some kind of personal connection to Avon.	6	10
But that doesn't turn into advertising, now, does it?	6	10
Why don't you tell us your biggest challenge?	6	10
We're here to listen. It's just hard to hide our enthusiasm.	6	10
It's true.	6	10
Well, they don't bring in a new guy unless they're expanding or sales are flat.	6	10
I'm afraid it's the latter.	6	10
Women are working. They're not home.	6	10
And hippies don't wear makeup at all.	6	10
"I'm not sure if we should try to be ""groovier"" or nostalgic."	6	10
We're somewhere in between right now.	6	10
That's about it.	6	10
Peggy?	6	10
Yes, Joan?	6	10
What do you think of your current work?	6	10
Besides the fact that it's not working?	6	10
It's okay. We didn't do it.	6	10
I don't know how to describe it.	6	10
Would you say it's unintentionally old-fashioned?	6	10
Yes. Yes, I would.	6	10
I'm sure you've thought of this already...	6	10
but Joan and I were saying how convenient it would be...	6	10
to have the Avon lady come to the office maybe during lunch.	6	10
Well, they're not resistant to trying that, just to advertising it.	6	10
There's no doorbell in an office.	6	10
I only saw a little bit of it on the morning news...	6	10
but I'm sorry I missed Humphrey's acceptance speech.	6	10
I assume he was high-voiced and desperate.	6	10
You're the exception. Early numbers look like over 80 million people.	6	10
Look, we all hated what we saw, but the Democrats are dead.	6	10
It's over. Not just now, maybe forever.	6	10
As you were. Nobody get up.	6	10
Nonsense, Jack. Great to see you finally.	6	10
Roger Sterling, Don Draper.	6	10
George was just laughing that these riots gave Nixon the election.	6	10
I don't think that's anything to smile about.	6	10
And although this boardroom has been the site...	6	10
of many casual political conversations among better men than us...	6	10
this is a business meeting.	6	10
You're right, Jack.	6	10
Last night was disgusting...	6	10
seeing those long-haired fools shame this country.	6	10
You think Richard Nixon is going to fix that?	6	10
I think he's a patriot.	6	10
Dutch Reagan is a patriot. Nixon is an opportunist.	6	10
Now why don't you gentlemen tell us how it's possible...	6	10
to devote your energies to our nutritious...	6	10
and delicious Instant Breakfast and Life Cereal at the same time?	6	10
Well, Jack, your powdered milk and dairy products...	6	10
have had a long, successful relationship with breakfast cereal.	6	10
There's no reason to give that up.	6	10
And as far as we can tell, Instant Breakfast has a different target- adults.	6	10
They don't eat cereal.	6	10
They eat bacon and eggs.	6	10
And this is healthier, easier and instant.	6	10
And what if we were to say we find the conflict unresolvable?	6	10
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we discussed this over the phone.	6	10
This is about a whole different level of exposure for your products.	6	10
All of them. You should be in game shows.	6	10
You should have a presence on Saturday morning.	6	10
Where we'll sit right next to one of your cereal ads?	6	10
- Don? - Look, Jack, George...	6	10
I'm sure you know that we would do anything to make this work.	6	10
We believe that strongly in Carnation.	6	10
We believe in the wholesomeness of both your intentions and your products.	6	10
To be frank, we've worked with New York firms before.	6	10
We come in in the morning, try to get you, everyone's at lunch.	6	10
And when people are at lunch around here...	6	10
that's just the time we get a message from you.	6	10
And with it comes an attitude...	6	10
as if to say we're not working hard out here.	6	10
I can assure you, it is very much to the contrary.	6	10
Look, we're sorry your last girlfriend hurt you.	6	10
We're in your office right now.	6	10
Tell us what you have in mind.	6	10
What is going on? I just handed you the business of your life.	6	10
What is going on? You just threw it away.	6	10
Morning, ladies.	6	10
Morning.	6	10
Stop that.	6	10
What exactly are you planning to do?	6	10
Are you trying to intimidate me?	6	10
No, that's always been impossible...	6	10
because that would require respect for me or what I do.	6	10
I know you want this, and now you can't have it.	6	10
You could've, but now you can't.	6	10
It's mine. And I've been doing account work...	6	10
in one form or another since the day I started.	6	10
But you're not in that department.	6	10
I never said that to you...	6	10
when you stopped filing and started writing copy.	6	10
Yes, you did. Every day.	6	10
And it was worse because you made me feel like I couldn't do it.	6	10
I know you can do this.	6	10
So why do you think I should give it away?	6	10
I worked my way up.	6	10
You were so brave, letting Don carry you to the deep end of the pool.	6	10
I never slept with him.	6	10
Congratulations. You really are just like them.	6	10
I'm sorry, but I never thought I would be in the position to say...	6	10
"""Joan, you've made a mistake."""	6	10
I have to do it myself, Peggy.	6	10
This is the only way I could do it.	6	10
Because all that matters now is who has a relationship with that client.	6	10
Who is the client going to call?	6	10
Well, I am sick to my stomach...	6	10
thinking about what you're going to say when they find out.	6	10
I'll be fine.	6	10
Gentlemen, after all...	6	10
this business of selling narrows down to one thing.	6	10
Just one thing. Seeing the people.	6	10
Show me any man of ordinary ability...	6	10
who will go out and earnestly tell-	6	10
Benson here.	6	10
- Ginzo, you have a visitor. - Where is he?	6	10
Michael?	6	10
- What's wrong? - I feel sick.	6	10
I got diarrhea. My mouth is dry.	6	10
I didn't sleep last night. I don't want to go. I'm not going.	6	10
Oh, sure. You'll talk to him?	6	10
I love you. You know that. You're a mother hen.	6	10
- Michael, you look fine. - Stop calling me Michael.	6	10
We have to go. It's a very important meeting.	6	10
And I don't say that to scare you, I say that to inspire you.	6	10
I'm not scared. I'm a thug.	6	10
I'm a pig. I'm part of the problem.	6	10
"""Now I am become Death. Destroyer of worlds."""	6	10
Come on, buddy. You're not Death.	6	10
You got a little stage fright.	6	10
Maybe you smoked too many funny cigarettes.	6	10
I never touch that stuff. It makes you crazy.	6	10
I know what you're feeling, and it's fear.	6	10
But not fear of failure, fear of opportunity.	6	10
I can't watch this.	6	10
Look, you can't put yourself in the right place at the right time.	6	10
You got to be in the right place all the time.	6	10
Listen, man, I can't turn off the transmissions to do harm.	6	10
They're beaming them right into my head.	6	10
Damn it, there is no harm in this!	6	10
Manischewitz are good people. They're your people.	6	10
And they sell wine for religious ceremonies of all faiths.	6	10
Now pull yourself together and be the man that I admire.	6	10
Tell me the truth. Are you a homo?	6	10
There's that sense of humor.	6	10
I would like to have her for lunch.	6	10
Well, don't have Harry Crane set it up.	6	10
He got us very high up with three major companies.	6	10
You forgot because Chevy fell in your lap...	6	10
but big accounts require a golf and dining offensive.	6	10
- When are we gonna do that? - Next time.	6	10
Harry, what did I say about that car?	6	10
Well, Cindy, these are my friends Don and Roger.	6	10
Pleasure.	6	10
There's tacos and booze outside.	6	10
If you want a joint, try the candy dish on the coffee table.	6	10
Or make a friend.	6	10
- You look familiar. - You'll have to do better than that.	6	10
As you can tell, there's a different protocol.	6	10
I look forward to figuring it out.	6	10
Just let me make introductions. They don't dig business cards.	6	10
Who is that? I know him.	6	10
Earl Rice from Kodak. He's their studio rep.	6	10
I don't think he was there when you were. I know he never goes east.	6	10
No, not him. Isn't that Danny?	6	10
Jesus, he is everywhere.	6	10
It's Daniel J. Siegel now.	6	10
Danny Siegel?	6	10
Producer. And that's Irwin Fields. He's at Paramount.	6	10
What's he doing here?	6	10
Probably trying to buy one of Danny's movies.	6	10
Not him.	6	10
Roger, Don. Where've you been all my life?	6	10
Come on. This will be fun.	6	10
Daniel, my man. Did we interrupt?	6	10
It'll keep, man.	6	10
Danny. What are you up to these days?	6	10
Taking care of business. That was Irwin Fields.	6	10
And this is just Lotus. She's from Sacramento.	6	10
- So how do you know Stephen? - Oh, I've known Stephen a long time.	6	10
Whereas Danny we've only known for a very short time.	6	10
I know these lugs back from my days in advertising.	6	10
More like a day, wasn't it?	6	10
Hey, it wasn't my bag. I had to quit.	6	10
You didn't quit. You were fired.	6	10
Harry, why don't you introduce me to the bar?	6	10
Hmm.	6	10
Actually, Danny and I used to be related.	6	10
Daniel.	6	10
His ex-wife is still my cousin.	6	10
You'd like her. She's about your age.	6	10
There are small differences.	6	10
- Tiny things you'd notice. - Hmm.	6	10
Stephen.	6	10
I was just telling Lotus here how I'm finally...	6	10
making a picture with a major studio.	6	10
We're gonna do Alice in Wonderland.	6	10
And Stephen over there works for Ben Kalmenson, president of Warner Brothers...	6	10
who's also here somewhere.	6	10
He took over from Jack Warner.	6	10
You know what, Lotus?	6	10
I'm gonna introduce you.	6	10
Nice rapping with you, Rog.	6	10
So most of the pictures don't have a lot of score right now.	6	10
They like pop songs. You know, kids want to hear a hit.	6	10
I think ads are going that way too.	6	10
What kind of ads you do?	6	10
Well, we represent Chevrolet, Mohawk Airlines.	6	10
- Where are they? - The northeast.	6	10
Samsonite luggage. Life Cereal.	6	10
Well, if times get tough, I'm gonna look you up, Donny.	6	10
I dig jingles, and I hear the bread's out of sight.	6	10
Don, there you are. Ben Kalmenson's leaving.	6	10
I think he's headed to a party in the canyon.	6	10
Should we follow him?	6	10
- You know Ben? - Do you?	6	10
I was looking for the restroom.	6	10
Well, there's an extra nipple here when you come back.	6	10
It can wait.	6	10
Take off your shoes.	6	10
Do you like hashish?	6	10
I don't know yet.	6	10
Hey, man, are you the guy who came in a taxi?	6	10
You don't talk much, do you?	6	10
In fact, I'm wondering if you're hearing a word I say.	6	10
Are you tripping?	6	10
I've done it five times.	6	10
So if you're trying to see through me...	6	10
just know that I am this handsome and this rich.	6	10
Don't worry about your hang-ups.	6	10
Lotus, let's split.	6	10
Together?	6	10
- She's gonna crash in my guesthouse. - Until her audition?	6	10
It's up to her, man.	6	10
I'm sure it is. Lotus, honey, there's no reason to start at the bottom.	6	10
Yeah, maybe he can help your dream come true...	6	10
of having your lips on the side of a bus.	6	10
What are you gonna do when you fail here? Keep going west?	6	10
Japan's a long walk for those little legs.	6	10
Lotus, let's go.	6	10
You're lucky I hate violence, man.	6	10
Really? I love it. You know, I was a boxer.	6	10
There's nothing like finding that magic spot...	6	10
that'll drop a man to his knees.	6	10
You know, unless he's already starting there.	6	10
Hated to do that.	6	10
Mmm.	6	10
I'm really thirsty.	6	10
There's a pool full of water out there, Don.	6	10
I told you, that's not my name.	6	10
There you are.	6	10
Honey, I-	6	10
You're here.	6	10
Is that your old lady?	6	10
It's cool. It's California.	6	10
Everybody shares.	6	10
What are you doing here?	6	10
I thought I'd surprise you.	6	10
How did you find me?	6	10
But I live here.	6	10
I quit my job.	6	10
I couldn't bear to be apart.	6	10
And I want to have enough love for my other surprise.	6	10
Really?	6	10
What do you think it is?	6	10
A second chance.	6	10
Come with me.	6	10
Everybody's looking for you.	6	10
I heard you were here.	6	10
Are you in the movie business too?	6	10
I'm not pitching for the Dodgers.	6	10
What happened?	6	10
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.	6	10
My wife thinks I'm M.I.A., but I'm actually dead.	6	10
How come you didn't get your arm back?	6	10
Dying doesn't make you whole.	6	10
You should see what you look like.	6	10
Man overboard!	6	10
He's fine. Everybody back away.	6	10
Is it real?	6	10
They took me to breakfast on the way to the airport and told me Jack signed off.	6	10
And he's high enough at Chevy he doesn't have to run it by the whole outfit and-	6	10
Bob Benson to see you both.	6	10
They finally let me see the car. They had clay models. It's not a dog.	6	10
I don't mean to interrupt.	6	10
- But that's what you're doing. - Come on in, Bob.	6	10
I just got off the phone with Manischewitz.	6	10
Apparently they're putting us in review.	6	10
- What happened? - They barely listened to the presentation.	6	10
It was a courtesy. They haven't liked the work for months.	6	10
Shit! Weren't you there?	6	10
Well, I thought it was high time we embraced Bob.	6	10
He was going to go. I talked him out of it.	6	10
Roger Sterling let you watch his dog, and it ran away.	6	10
Bob, we appreciate you handling this like a man.	6	10
And as a reward, Ted and I want you to familiarize yourself with Chevy.	6	10
We just found out we're moving to the next step.	6	10
We're going to need more than Ken in Detroit.	6	10
That's music to my ears.	6	10
Welcome aboard.	6	10
They shouldn't have gone to California.	6	10
We're going to bring in Avon. They gave us Chevy.	6	10
Throw in losing Sterling's account, I think we have a lot of good news.	6	10
They're not gonna think that.	6	10
You're splitting this place and not in half.	6	10
We'll give them something to take their mind off it.	6	10
What do we have?	6	10
You caught a cold in California.	6	10
I don't know what happened.	6	10
I usually feel better out there.	6	10
You've got to stop talking in the past. You know what I learned?	6	10
New York is the center of the universe.	6	10
We could send a landing craft out there, but they don't understand what we do.	6	10
Or they understand it thoroughly.	6	10
My shrink says the job of your life is to know yourself.	6	10
Sooner or later, you'll start to love who you are.	6	10
And apparently I'm a curious child...	6	10
with a full head of hair and a thriving business.	6	10
And you're a terrible swimmer.	6	10
Come in.	6	10
Mr. Campbell wants to see you in the conference room.	6	10
Oh. And what is it regarding?	6	10
Avon sent over a box of samples to the girls...	6	10
and Diane opened it, not me.	6	10
I'll be right in.	6	10
Everyone out!	6	10
She'll be right in.	6	10
This shouldn't be in here.	6	10
What the hell is this?	6	10
I guess Avon's serious.	6	10
Oh, they're serious.	6	10
"When the hell did you have a ""productive breakfast""?"	6	10
- You and Peggy ditched me. - Peggy didn't know.	6	10
There was some confusion, and then it was too late.	6	10
- And I thought since I mixed things up- - There was no confusion!	6	10
- Oh, I'm sorry. - I bet you are.	6	10
Were you coming in here to celebrate what a fool I am?	6	10
You upset the girls. They have nothing to do with this.	6	10
So, you opening up your own agency?	6	10
Ted assigned her.	6	10
Isn't the point that Avon's happy?	6	10
Oh, I bet you're making him very happy.	6	10
Because it's better than being screwed by you.	6	10
We'll see what Ted has to say about this.	6	10
Let me handle Ted.	6	10
It's too late for that.	6	10
Ask her.	6	10
Did you meet with Avon and not invite Pete?	6	10
It was very last-minute.	6	10
Peggy, this doesn't concern you.	6	10
It's unacceptable, and I'd like to know what you have to say for yourself.	6	10
- Does this color look good on me? - Shh!	6	10
What would you like for me to say?	6	10
Joan, you of all people can't plead ignorance.	6	10
She's going to say something about her client and her connection.	6	10
And, honestly, I take no issue with that.	6	10
But what we have here is a breach of the fundamental rules of this business.	6	10
An account executive signs business...	6	10
and they send their junior to maintain it.	6	10
To maintain their boss's relationship.	6	10
The entire thing falls apart if I send you to the store to get cake...	6	10
and you eat it on the way home.	6	10
Did you really try to squeeze him out?	6	10
You have nothing to say for yourself, then?	6	10
It's a revolt!	6	10
- Excuse me. - Meredith, not now.	6	10
"""Joan, Andrew Hayes from Avon is on the phone for you."""	6	10
Oh, it just gets better.	6	10
What are you waiting for? Go take it.	6	10
- That's it? - Possession is nine-tenths of the law.	6	10
Only where there is no law.	6	10
Pete, we're all working together.	6	10
All agency business is your business.	6	10
Thank you.	6	10
You better hope he really calls.	6	10
Welcome back. How was your trip?	6	10
If you don't mind, this is urgent.	6	10
Aren't you glad you didn't go straight home?	6	10
I have to tell you that in your absence, things have become quite dire.	6	10
Mr. Draper, the partners are here.	6	10
Come in.	6	10
Welcome back. How was California?	6	10
It was a series of busts and not the kind I like.	6	10
Well, we have a bit of news concerning the firm.	6	10
- We should get Joan. - No.	6	10
- Anyone else? - No, thank you.	6	10
My visit to Detroit was a success.	6	10
They finally signed off on the strategy. Even showed me a model of the car.	6	10
That's a relief. Good work.	6	10
Also, Joan's at the five-yard line with Avon Cosmetics.	6	10
Joan?	6	10
Well, well, well. While the cat's away-	6	10
Unfortunately, Manischewitz has put us in review.	6	10
Ah, it's been coming for months.	6	10
But that's not what we're here to talk about.	6	10
We thought long and hard about what it's gonna take to make this agency stable.	6	10
I'd like to offer what we believe to be a deferential solution.	6	10
They want to call the agency Sterling, Cooper & Partners.	6	10
Well, we know you like it.	6	10
It would depend on Don, Jim, and me all sharing the blow.	6	10
You're willing to do that?	6	10
It's the only thing that's equally offensive to all.	6	10
S.C. ampersand P.	6	10
I can swallow it if you can.	6	10
I don't think I should weigh in on this.	6	10
Good. Then it's settled.	6	10
I'll get the art department on a logo.	6	10
- Nice work. - I had nothing to do with this.	6	10
Have a good weekend.	6	10
You have no problems with this?	6	10
Pete, we're in the same boat, and I'm fine with it.	6	10
Trust me, that name is a consolation prize.	6	10
It's a gravestone to our resistance.	6	10
You have no idea what's going on out there.	6	10
This is not the same business anymore!	6	10
If you don't like it, maybe it's time to get out of the business.	6	10
Dawn, could you get my wife on the phone?	6	10
What are you doing?	6	10
Working.	6	10
Give me that.	6	10
Hey. 	6	10
Good morning, Mr. Draper.	6	11
Mr. Sterling's inside.	6	11
Do you want ice?	6	11
Coffee.	6	11
It's one thing to be near the bar. It's another thing to be under it.	6	11
Sunkist sent us a crate.	6	11
I've seen blind people juggle, but somehow it seems to be beyond me.	6	11
Just close your eyes. That's what you did in the meeting.	6	11
Whatever I did, it worked. We're in it.	6	11
That's good news.	6	11
Step one, I send it to research.	6	11
Step two, you'll need to get that little idea factory working.	6	11
There's only one angle-	6	11
an orange... that's orange on TV.	6	11
I thought they were pretty clear they're too cheap to get out of print.	6	11
So talk 'em out of it or into it.	6	11
I'd love to, but I think it demands a media strategy.	6	11
Forget research. Put Harry Crane on it.	6	11
Look at you.	6	11
See? Not all surprises are bad.	6	11
The ants, they look like people.	6	11
He should be right out. Is there anything I can get you?	6	11
- I think she would like a cup of tea. - In a teacup.	6	11
I'd be more excited if we didn't have to go in Ted's plane to present.	6	11
- Hello, Mother. - Hello, Peter.	6	11
Manolo, may I speak with you a moment?	6	11
Of course, Mr. Campbell. Your tea is coming.	6	11
I'll be fine. I'm not a child.	6	11
Peggy, would you mind?	6	11
Mrs. Campbell, nice to meet you.	6	11
There's no reason for you to be so formal, dear.	6	11
Sit with me.	6	11
How are you today?	6	11
I can't tell you how much it relieves me to see you and Peter reunited.	6	11
Well, it was really a by-product of the merger.	6	11
I'm glad you both swallowed your pride, if nothing else...	6	11
but for the good of the child you have together.	6	11
Excuse me?	6	11
Oh, I've embarrassed you.	6	11
Your son and I are not together that way.	6	11
Trudy, dear, don't deny him.	6	11
Don't reject his caresses.	6	11
Mrs. Campbell-	6	11
I hope you two can someday find...	6	11
what Manolo and I have found.	6	11
I waited long enough...	6	11
to experience the physical satisfactions of love.	6	11
Did she go to China for that tea?	6	11
Thank you for driving her out to Bud's.	6	11
I've paid you for the extra day.	6	11
I know that you don't drive.	6	11
Well, I do, but not to her satisfaction.	6	11
Bob Benson was right about you. You're worth every penny.	6	11
Bob is a wonderful salesman.	6	11
Still, I want you to have a little something off the books.	6	11
Mr. Campbell, I refuse.	6	11
It's important to me that you treat my mother well...	6	11
but also that you treat yourself.	6	11
- The pleasure is all mine. - I know that isn't true.	6	11
Sally, get in here.	6	11
Hello.	6	11
What?	6	11
Julie's mother called and told me you were the only two girls on the trip.	6	11
So?	6	11
You're not staying in a Midtown hotel with all those boys.	6	11
Miss O'Shea's gonna be there.	6	11
She's 25.	6	11
What's the point of having a mansion...	6	11
if you're gonna spend all your time in here?	6	11
Fine, I won't do the Model UN. It was his idea.	6	11
Fine, you're not going.	6	11
- Can't we stay with Daddy? - You mean with no one.	6	11
You hate that Daddy supports my dreams.	6	11
He doesn't think I'm just a pain in the ass.	6	11
Your father is a hero.	6	11
Like everything else in this country...	6	11
Diplomacy Club's just another excuse to make out.	6	11
I thought she should join the Student Congress. The UN's a joke.	6	11
- Oh, you're home. - Who's this?	6	11
This is Mitchell- Sylvia and Arnold's son.	6	11
Nice to finally meet you, Mitchell. I'm Don.	6	11
Thanks again, Megan.	6	11
What did he want?	6	11
Um-	6	11
I'm sworn to secrecy, but he's in a lot of trouble.	6	11
What happened?	6	11
He's 1-A.	6	11
But he's in school.	6	11
He sent back his draft card in protest. They reclassified him.	6	11
What did he think was gonna happen? Stupid kid.	6	11
Don, he knows he screwed up. He wants to run.	6	11
You know, to Canada.	6	11
I suppose I could call my brother-in-law, but I can't do that to Sylvia and Arnold.	6	11
- Can I? - Just leave it alone.	6	11
- He's so scared. - He should be.	6	11
He can't spend the rest of his life on the run.	6	11
I know how you feel...	6	11
but you don't want him to go to Vietnam.	6	11
Megan, it's not our problem.	6	11
Could you get me another whiskey sour?	6	11
Sure.	6	11
Maybe I'll switch to whiskey sours.	6	11
How about a Shirley Temple then?	6	11
I don't think Dramamine and booze go together.	6	11
I don't think Dramamine and cranberry juice go together either.	6	11
But I thought we'd be back on your little plane...	6	11
not having a romantic dinner.	6	11
- Don't you want to celebrate? - I want to live, Ted.	6	11
What?	6	11
He doesn't like flying.	6	11
Well, you've seen how simple it is now. There's nothing to be afraid of.	6	11
My father died in a plane crash.	6	11
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.	6	11
Was he a pilot?	6	11
Ha! No.	6	11
A passenger.	6	11
Look, you're driving. Can we please, please have another round?	6	11
You still have to get home from White Plains.	6	11
I'll hail a cab.	6	11
He's such a New Yorker.	6	11
This is the agency I always wanted.	6	11
Ambition, brains, and beauty.	6	11
Yeah, but what about him?	6	11
I'm gonna cut you off too, my dear.	6	11
I should call home.	6	11
If the check comes, I'm sending it to Ocean Spray.	6	11
Can you imagine what it does to his wife every time he takes that plane?	6	11
I guess so.	6	11
You don't want me to talk about his wife.	6	11
You don't know what you're talking about.	6	11
But I do. I've seen that look.	6	11
I know, but-	6	11
nothing can happen.	6	11
And he's in love with you too.	6	11
You're the one who's in love with him.	6	11
Well, I could use an account, and he's been generous.	6	11
At least one of us ended up important.	6	11
Please tell me you don't pity me.	6	11
I don't.	6	11
Because you really know me.	6	11
I do.	6	11
I should tell you...	6	11
I had a very strange conversation with your mother.	6	11
There's no other kind.	6	11
Well, it doesn't matter.	6	11
What did she say?	6	11
I think she thought I was your wife...	6	11
and Manuel was her husband.	6	11
My father never treated her that well.	6	11
Maybe that's it. She thinks she's in love with him.	6	11
I could see it. Manolo is very charming.	6	11
I don't think you understand.	6	11
She thinks she's... making love with him.	6	11
Tell me exactly what she said.	6	11
Did your father ever give her spa treatments...	6	11
"that released a ""fire in her loins""?"	6	11
Oh!	6	11
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.	6	11
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told you.	6	11
But I can't get the image out of my head.	6	11
Stop it, please.	6	11
I don't even want to think about her brushing her teeth.	6	11
I thought I cut you two off.	6	11
Ted, I have never been less afraid of flying in my life.	6	11
What? What does he mean?	6	11
Nothing.	6	11
Well, I should get the check.	6	11
Honey, who's that gonna be?	6	11
- Arnold. - Is it too late?	6	11
For what? Come in.	6	11
Look, I would have called, but Sylvia is-	6	11
Listen, about this afternoon-	6	11
Oh, hello, Arnold.	6	11
I'm sorry about my kid dropping in on you.	6	11
I didn't know if I should tell you.	6	11
Well, he figured you would...	6	11
and I don't want you in the middle of this.	6	11
His mother's treating it like he's dying. She doesn't want anyone to know.	6	11
Do you want a drink?	6	11
Sit up here drinking while they're down there slamming the doors?	6	11
And you lied to me.	6	11
Been meaning to knock on your door anyway.	6	11
You know, catch a game or something.	6	11
I get baseball tickets. Mostly the Mets.	6	11
Well, then I'm glad you didn't.	6	11
You know, I didn't even know he left school.	6	11
Sylvia says she didn't know either.	6	11
She's doing that a lot lately- lying about little things.	6	11
Could tell something's been wrong all year.	6	11
- Another Manhattan? - Nah. No.	6	11
Should have never let him go to Paris.	6	11
He got there right in the middle of the riots.	6	11
His French is excellent.	6	11
I think he got a lot of girls as an expatriate revolutionary.	6	11
Could kill him right now.	6	11
There has to be a way.	6	11
Oh, believe me, everybody's an expert on it.	6	11
Sylvia's father was suddenly Clarence Darrow.	6	11
It's thrilling to see a plumber interpret international law.	6	11
You're one of the top surgeons in the country.	6	11
You must know somebody.	6	11
I know a lot of people, but it doesn't matter.	6	11
It doesn't matter if he goes back to school.	6	11
He's 1-A. His induction could be tomorrow.	6	11
He's on a damn list for the rest of his life.	6	11
On some level, you have to admire his idealism.	6	11
You sound like Sylvia.	6	11
But she doesn't really buy his bullshit.	6	11
You think she's gonna let her baby rot in jail for a cause?	6	11
I don't know what to do.	6	11
What would you do?	6	11
If it was my kid, or if it was me?	6	11
You were in the service, right?	6	11
I was.	6	11
You see action?	6	11
It was very different.	6	11
I wanted to go.	6	11
And then when I got there, well-	6	11
That's the trick.	6	11
Kids 18, 19 years old, they have no sense of their own mortality.	6	11
Or anyone else's.	6	11
That's why they make good soldiers.	6	11
Well, the army paid for med school.	6	11
I served in a hospital in Pusan.	6	11
We were very lucky.	6	11
Lucky enough to live in this country.	6	11
And service is part of that bargain- sacrifice.	6	11
We knew that.	6	11
The war is wrong.	6	11
I'll tell you right now, if anyone was ever gonna get it, it's gonna be him.	6	11
He's soft.	6	11
I'm sure he's a good kid.	6	11
The best.	6	11
Cold pills and capsules take a while, don't they?	6	11
Dristan Mist can unlock sinus blockage.	6	11
What you watching?	6	11
I don't know.	6	11
What's the matter? I called.	6	11
I didn't want to get into it when you're about to fly...	6	11
but you were supposed to have dinner with us.	6	11
I made a mistake. We'll do it tomorrow.	6	11
You don't have to make a federal case out of it.	6	11
Why don't you get a legal pad and write down...	6	11
a bunch of excuses for the next week?	6	11
Because none of them mean anything to the boys.	6	11
What about food, clothing and shelter? Does that mean anything?	6	11
Remember what the minister said at Frank's funeral?	6	11
"""God can turn off the lights at any moment."""	6	11
You know where you're gonna be? The office.	6	11
This is temporary.	6	11
I just have to do this until-	6	11
Until what?	6	11
Until you... are back where you were at the old firm?	6	11
Because things weren't so great then either.	6	11
So we've moved on from I'm working too much to something else.	6	11
The problem is, even when you do come home, you're not here.	6	11
You're obsessed.	6	11
And I can feel how disappointing this all is compared to your battles at work.	6	11
I'm not enjoying that.	6	11
How did we get to the point where you think I don't want you to enjoy things?	6	11
I know you like having a young copywriter in your airplane.	6	11
Come on, Pete was there too.	6	11
And I know you like facing Don Draper every morning more than the clients.	6	11
How was your day?	6	11
I just wish you liked being here more.	6	11
Could you get Mr. Campbell?	6	11
Do you want to see him before the status meeting?	6	11
- When's that? - Now.	6	11
And I also need to know if you're attending the Chevrolet dinner.	6	11
- When's that? - Tonight.	6	11
- Morning. - May I speak with you?	6	11
Does your friend still work at the Department of Defense?	6	11
No, he left for Union Carbide.	6	11
But he probably still has pull over there.	6	11
What happened now?	6	11
You must know plenty of people with kids getting deferments.	6	11
How are they doing that?	6	11
They go to college. Divinity school. Medical baloney.	6	11
No, it's too late for that. I need someone who can really pull strings.	6	11
Well, aren't you having dinner with General Motors...	6	11
one of the largest defense contractors in the world?	6	11
What are the politics of that?	6	11
I don't know, Don. I'm not on Chevy.	6	11
Shall we?	6	11
That's not my fault.	6	11
Don't worry. If I had Chevy...	6	11
I wouldn't be able to devote my full attention to Ocean Spray.	6	11
- Cranberries? - Cranberry Cocktail.	6	11
And they like us so much, they might even give us the blends.	6	11
- What about Sunkist? - What about it?	6	11
It's orange juice.	6	11
Morning, everyone.	6	11
- Did you know about Sunkist? - What about it?	6	11
Don told Harry to put together a media plan right away.	6	11
Why didn't you tell us about that?	6	11
Isn't this the meeting where I tell you?	6	11
Are we having this meeting?	6	11
Why didn't you tell us you were presenting to Ocean Spray?	6	11
There's been a series of memos.	6	11
Didn't you wonder where everybody was?	6	11
- We can't present to both. - Which one is bigger?	6	11
They're about the same. Three million.	6	11
We've already spent $5,000 on Ocean Spray.	6	11
What about our trip to California?	6	11
Was it $5,000?	6	11
I have a lot of receipts. I haven't figured it out yet.	6	11
Why don't you join this company and read a memo once in a while?	6	11
Maybe they're not a conflict.	6	11
We don't have either yet.	6	11
I really didn't know.	6	11
I warned you about the memos, Ted.	6	11
The more you send, the less they get read.	6	11
Imagine if every time Ginger Rogers jumped in the air...	6	11
Fred Astaire punched her in the face.	6	11
Why are you taking this to heart?	6	11
Because it's directed at me. Can you not see that?	6	11
So what? You know we'll end up with just one juice.	6	11
I don't want his juice. I want my juice.	6	11
It's all your juice.	6	11
Tell him that.	6	11
Michigan's in the Big Ten.	6	11
Ron Kutchinski just ran the fastest half mile in the world.	6	11
- He's going to the Olympics. - You're selling yourself short.	6	11
I'm telling you, they would be lucky to have you.	6	11
I got it.	6	11
Look at this. Got a couple of high fashion models.	6	11
Aren't you a gentleman?	6	11
- Hey. - Hello.	6	11
Youse two don't know each other.	6	11
These are my two favorite people. Mitchell Rosen, 16A...	6	11
I'd like you to meet Sally Draper, 17B and all points north.	6	11
I'm Julie. I'm crashing at Sally's.	6	11
Cool.	6	11
They were supposed to leave a key for me. I lost mine.	6	11
Nobody said nothin' to me, but that don't mean nothin'.	6	11
We were going to go out for dinner tonight. What's good around here?	6	11
His mother's cooking.	6	11
Around here, it's just old people.	6	11
Are you a musician?	6	11
'Cause you look like one.	6	11
Who?	6	11
I don't see it. I'll let you in.	6	11
- Oh, good day to you, Mrs. Rosen. - Hello.	6	11
- Mitchell, did you get a cab? - I was waiting for you.	6	11
You're unbelievable.	6	11
I got it, Mrs. Rosen. Do you know Sally and, um-	6	11
I'm Julie.	6	11
I'm sorry, girls. We're in a bit of a rush.	6	11
I'll get your cab lickety-split.	6	11
Bring them right back.	6	11
You're living with Mark Lindsay.	6	11
I don't live here.	6	11
What are you doing here? I said I'd meet you at La Grenouille.	6	11
Dorothy, you must let me manage your calendar.	6	11
I'm not standing in the hallway.	6	11
Come in.	6	11
You get ready, Mr. Campbell. I'll entertain her.	6	11
Actually, Manolo, I'd like my mother to myself this evening.	6	11
Very well. Good night, my sweet.	6	11
Must he?	6	11
He has other plans, Mother.	6	11
Yes, Dorothy. I'll be there when you wake.	6	11
- Can I fix you something? - No.	6	11
Manolo doesn't like me to drink.	6	11
He likes me sharp.	6	11
It's so nice the way he looks after you.	6	11
Oh, Peter, he's a gift to me.	6	11
I just wanted to make sure you're aware he's your nurse.	6	11
You are prone to moments of confusion.	6	11
I suppose there's a way I could mistake your tone for concern.	6	11
Oh, I am concerned that you have-	6	11
how do I put this?-	6	11
misconstrued Manolo's attention for affection.	6	11
If we're going to have an adult conversation...	6	11
let's have an adult conversation.	6	11
Has he taken advantage of you?	6	11
Manny has awakened a part of me that was long dormant.	6	11
Don't you think I'm entitled to the pleasures of love?	6	11
Do not be more specific.	6	11
Since when is it any of your business what goes on in my bedroom?	6	11
I am afraid that we are going to have to let him go.	6	11
Oh, no. What did he do?	6	11
He's a pervert.	6	11
You were a sour little boy.	6	11
And you're a sour little man.	6	11
How could I expect you to be understanding?	6	11
You've always been unlovable.	6	11
Now I've lost my appetite. I'm leaving.	6	11
You'll never find your way home.	6	11
I have carfare...	6	11
and a piece of paper with my address...	6	11
written in his elegant handwriting.	6	11
Mother.	6	11
Cheesecake? Chocolate cake?	6	11
- Two of everything. - And another round.	6	11
- Why not? - Oh, I can never get enough of it.	6	11
Growing up in Cleveland, my dad would take me right on Lake Erie.	6	11
But the water's gone bad now.	6	11
You should go to Florida.	6	11
Saltwater. Down off the Keys, where the marlin run.	6	11
Write your own Hemingway story.	6	11
If you don't catch anything, you have to blow your brains out.	6	11
So, Ross, where do you take your kid fishing?	6	11
I just got the two girls, and they could never keep their mouths shut.	6	11
But my grandson's just like me.	6	11
Last summer, we went up to Muskoka. Ontario.	6	11
Jesus, now we gotta hear about this kid again.	6	11
Brendan's at Antioch.	6	11
Yep, studying the classics.	6	11
But I hope he'll come to his senses.	6	11
He's got a couple of years before he has decisions to make.	6	11
Well, as long as we're working together, he's got a job with us.	6	11
Friend of mine's kid just got to that point.	6	11
He doesn't have a lot of choices left. 1-A. Can you imagine?	6	11
Well, my heart goes out to him...	6	11
but that's just one of those problems that can't be solved.	6	11
Yeah.	6	11
I've got two sons.	6	11
Thank God they're too young.	6	11
I don't even like to think about that.	6	11
I know.	6	11
My friend is just beside himself.	6	11
I mean, people are doing things though.	6	11
Believe me, we know about that.	6	11
Makes me sick.	6	11
Well, next year this time, we'll have won the war.	6	11
We'll take Brendan to dinner, get him plastered...	6	11
and have him read the menu in Latin.	6	11
Ted, are you an angler?	6	11
My hobby is coming up with names for the XP.	6	11
Last one.	6	11
Okay.	6	11
"""Things I like about Mitchell."""	6	11
"- ""His ass""? - Shh."	6	11
When did you see that?	6	11
I couldn't think of anything else.	6	11
What did you put?	6	11
"""How he smiled at me."""	6	11
"""His shoulders."""	6	11
"""His red shirt."""	6	11
You girls have a big day tomorrow.	6	11
And I can tell you right now, the next time this door opens, it won't be me.	6	11
- Lights out. - Good night, Mrs. Draper.	6	11
Why do you keep calling her that?	6	11
'Cause she hates it.	6	11
Think about it. He's right down there.	6	11
You should sneak down and kiss him.	6	11
He talked to you.	6	11
God, I wish I lived here.	6	11
- Yeah? - Did I wake you?	6	11
- Yeah. - There's a rat in my apartment.	6	11
Told you to get traps.	6	11
It's in the trap, and it's mortally wounded.	6	11
I'm pretty sure, 'cause there's a lot of blood.	6	11
Did you call an ambulance?	6	11
You have to come over. It went under the couch.	6	11
I can't even look. What if it's still alive?	6	11
What if I lift the couch and it starts flipping around?	6	11
I'm not your boyfriend.	6	11
Maybe I'll make it worth your while if you come over.	6	11
No, you won't. Now good night.	6	11
- You're not interested? - No.	6	11
Then why are you using your sexy voice?	6	11
Tuesday morning's great.	6	11
For what?	6	11
Oh. Why didn't you say so?	6	11
You can bring her.	6	11
It'll be dead by morning.	6	11
Eleanor Roosevelt.	6	11
I can't remember anything 'cause I didn't sleep.	6	11
Your floor smells like pee.	6	11
- No, it doesn't. - Do I smell like pee?	6	11
You smell like Prell.	6	11
Sally, you're not ready?	6	11
I let the guest shower first.	6	11
Well, I have to go to work.	6	11
But first I have to put you two in a cab, so shake a leg.	6	11
Oh, take out the trash.	6	11
I have to get ready.	6	11
I'll do it, Mrs. Draper.	6	11
It's Megan.	6	11
I would love to visit the studio sometime.	6	11
Well, hopefully I'll still have a job.	6	11
I have to make a phone call.	6	11
- Your agent? - Yes, actually.	6	11
Could you get me some coffee?	6	11
What the hell were you up to last night?	6	11
Mr. Draper?	6	11
I'm fine, Dawn. You want some coffee?	6	11
What the hell were you thinking?	6	11
You said you weren't going to be involved in Chevy until 1970.	6	11
So stay the hell out of it. Stop trying to poison my relationship.	6	11
Last time I checked, it's our relationship.	6	11
And not everything's about you, Ted.	6	11
Then be better at it.	6	11
- What are you talking about? - You know this.	6	11
A client shouldn't have a single negative feeling in your presence.	6	11
Not the food, not the wine and certainly not the war.	6	11
I was just taking their temperature.	6	11
Why would you do that? It's Chevy, Don.	6	11
- You'd do it for your kid. - But it's not your kid.	6	11
Oh, is it your kid?	6	11
No, it's my friend's kid.	6	11
Well, I bet you don't have a lot of friends, Don...	6	11
so I'm going to assume this is important.	6	11
It is.	6	11
I just- I don't know what to do.	6	11
Do you know how young 19 is?	6	11
Did you ever think about talking to me instead of our most important client?	6	11
I don't know. It's GM.	6	11
Who else has that kind of clout in Washington?	6	11
Does he wear glasses?	6	11
I don't think so, but he could.	6	11
The guy who taught me to fly...	6	11
is a brigadier general in the Air National Guard.	6	11
They're always looking for exceptional young men to become pilots.	6	11
And you'd be willing to call him?	6	11
I'd consider it.	6	11
But first, you're going to have to stop the war.	6	11
I can't stop the war, Ted.	6	11
Don't be an asshole, Don. The war you're waging on me.	6	11
You have to lower your weapons.	6	11
What are you talking about?	6	11
I'm talking about how we are going to get Ocean Spray.	6	11
So you need to stop chasing Sunkist.	6	11
You're not going to compete with me like that anymore.	6	11
We're on the same damn side.	6	11
That's it?	6	11
Don't act like it's nothing.	6	11
It seems to be impossible so far.	6	11
You'd really do that?	6	11
Thank you.	6	11
This is not a handshake of gratitude. This is a binding contract.	6	11
Of course. Whatever you want.	6	11
That's what I want.	6	11
Hold on. What's the next step?	6	11
Tell the kid to write a letter about his childhood dream of being a pilot.	6	11
And it better be convincing. You should write it.	6	11
And tell him to get a haircut.	6	11
Be straight, Ted. What are the chances?	6	11
I'm going to call right now.	6	11
Thank you.	6	11
Can you get Dr. Rosen on the phone?	6	11
Rosen residence.	6	11
It's me. It's Don.	6	11
What do you want?	6	11
I'm trying to reach Arnold.	6	11
The office said he was home sick.	6	11
It's about Mitchell.	6	11
What? Tell me.	6	11
I know someone who knows someone in the Air National Guard.	6	11
He's getting him a spot.	6	11
You told someone?	6	11
It's my partner.	6	11
He's doing me a favor.	6	11
Did you fix it?	6	11
He just wants Mitchell to cut his hair and sign a letter.	6	11
And the two of you need to make sure he follows through.	6	11
Oh, he'll follow through.	6	11
I bet.	6	11
My God, is it possible?	6	11
I think so, but we have to act fast.	6	11
They went upstate to the VA to call on an army buddy.	6	11
I'll send them up tonight.	6	11
Sylvia, sweetheart, it's gonna be okay.	6	11
Are you there?	6	11
Yes.	6	11
Please, stop crying.	6	11
Oh. I feel better, but I'll feel better when I know it's done.	6	11
Don.	6	11
Yes?	6	11
I can't believe you would do this for me.	6	11
You know I have children too.	6	11
I know that's not why you're doing it.	6	11
And I hope-	6	11
Well, I hope you know that I was just frustrated with you.	6	11
I do now.	6	11
I didn't want you to fall in love.	6	11
You didn't feel anything?	6	11
No, I just-	6	11
I don't want to go through this again.	6	11
You were good to me.	6	11
Better than I was to you.	6	11
Are we going to lunch? Because-	6	11
Get in here and close the door.	6	11
You have given me a terrible problem, and now you're going to fix it.	6	11
Is this about Sunkist? Because I did some digging-	6	11
I told you we needed a nurse, and you sent us a rapist.	6	11
Manolo?	6	11
In fact, I never told you anything. You were just doing some digging.	6	11
Calm down. Sit down.	6	11
Bob.	6	11
She has the mind of a child. That man took advantage of her.	6	11
I assume she told you this story.	6	11
Don't you have your answer right there?	6	11
She says they're in love...	6	11
and it's the first time in months she's seemed sure of anything.	6	11
I don't think that Manolo's interests turn that way.	6	11
Great, so he's a degenerate. That means he's capable of anything.	6	11
What exactly did she say?	6	11
Please, I'm just trying to forget it.	6	11
Drink that.	6	11
- You feel better now? - I do.	6	11
Can I ask you something? Did she seem happy?	6	11
Yes. She did.	6	11
Is it really so impossible to imagine?	6	11
What?	6	11
Couldn't it be that if someone took care of you-	6	11
very good care of you-	6	11
if this person would do anything for you...	6	11
if your well-being was his only thought...	6	11
is it impossible that you might...	6	11
begin to feel something for him?	6	11
When there's true love, it doesn't matter who it is.	6	11
Tell him I'll give him a month's pay.	6	11
And tell him it's disgusting.	6	11
Of course.	6	11
The capital of the Philippines is Manila.	6	11
Its president is Ferdinand Marcos.	6	11
Its national language is Tagalog...	6	11
but many of its inhabitants speak Spanish due to its colonial past.	6	11
And their national product is-	6	11
I don't know. Manila envelopes?	6	11
- You don't know anything. - So?	6	11
How about this? All the boys are going to think you're dumb.	6	11
Don't tell me how to get boys.	6	11
You went to second base twice.	6	11
That's a lot more than you.	6	11
- So if I were you, I'd be scared. - Of what?	6	11
Of what you're going to do when Mitchell asks you to go all the way.	6	11
He doesn't even know I'm alive.	6	11
Oh, I took care of that.	6	11
What did you do?	6	11
- I introduced you. - I introduced myself.	6	11
No, I took the letter, and I signed your name.	6	11
- What? - And I slid it under the back door.	6	11
Ow! That really hurts.	6	11
How could you do that? Now I can never go back.	6	11
You know you're going to thank me.	6	11
Just because your shift is over...	6	11
doesn't mean you can get undressed in the lobby.	6	11
- Incredible. - What?	6	11
He should greet you. How you doing today?	6	11
I'm- I got- I left something.	6	11
And I don't have my key.	6	11
You mean you lost it already?	6	11
Can I have the keys, please?	6	11
Yeah. Okay.	6	11
Go fast.	6	11
Oh, what have we got here?	6	11
Couple of high fashion models?	6	11
Oh, God.	6	11
- Sally. - Oh, God.	6	11
Oh, dear God.	6	11
Dear God, what have we done?	6	11
Sally!	6	11
Sally!	6	11
Sally!	6	11
Did Sally just come through here?	6	11
Mr. Draper, I didn't know you was home.	6	11
She hopped in a cab just now. I'll go get her.	6	11
You okay?	6	11
Yes.	6	11
Did something happen?	6	11
I know she lost her keys. I gave her the keys. It's my fault.	6	11
Mr. Draper?	6	11
Don't you ever work through channels?	6	11
- Who blew the whistle? Brent? - Loud and clear.	6	11
Governor, I've tried to work with local intelligence from the beginning.	6	11
Brent threw me out. Now, why?	6	11
Because it's big. That's why.	6	11
We've had big ones before, but, this time, all I get is smoke.	6	11
Why didn't you tell me?	6	11
McGarrett, this is an important state.	6	11
It's our nation's extended finger into the Pacific-	6	11
the ocean where two-thirds-	6	11
two of the three billion persons on earth meet and touch.	6	11
Hello?	6	11
Oh, I'm glad you're home.	6	11
Let me get you a plate.	6	11
Oh, wow.	6	11
I had a client- meeting. Lunch.	6	11
- Sit down. - I'm, uh-	6	11
I'm gonna lie down.	6	11
You need to get some food in you. Sit down.	6	11
Do you want me to cut you a piece?	6	11
No.	6	11
I got it.	6	11
Hello.	6	11
I'm sorry to bother you.	6	11
Don, Arnold and Mitchell are here.	6	11
- I don't feel well. - Stop.	6	11
Hello, Mitchell.	6	11
I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner, but we just got back...	6	11
and Mitchell has something he wants to say.	6	11
Mr. Draper.	6	11
Thank you very much.	6	11
We'll see if it works.	6	11
What?	6	11
He didn't tell you?	6	11
Don talked to somebody for us.	6	11
Really?	6	11
Sylvia sends her gratitude. She is overwhelmed.	6	11
Do you want something to eat? We should celebrate.	6	11
One step at a time.	6	11
Anyway, Don...	6	11
I owe you.	6	11
Let's go.	6	11
No, you eat. I got it.	6	11
You are the sweetest man.	6	11
You make me sick!	6	11
Sally, come back here!	6	11
What happened?	6	11
I don't know.	6	11
- I'm gonna go talk to her. - No. I'll talk to her.	6	11
She has a crush on Mitchell.	6	11
Oh.	6	11
Sally.	6	11
- Open the door. - No.	6	11
You don't get to talk to me anymore.	6	11
Sally?	6	11
Sally, open the door. I need to talk to you.	6	11
I know you think you saw something.	6	11
I was... comforting Mrs. Rosen.	6	11
She was very upset.	6	11
It's very...	6	11
complicated.	6	11
Sally, can you hear me?	6	11
Yes.	6	11
Did you hear what I said?	6	11
Okay. 	6	11
I was waiting up.	6	12
I didn't want to wake you.	6	12
Don.	6	12
What?	6	12
I don't know what's going on...	6	12
but you have to pull back on the throttle a little, honey.	6	12
Don, turn off the range.	6	12
Sorry, I forgot about them.	6	12
It's fine.	6	12
I want to make you a real breakfast. You look terrible.	6	12
So do you.	6	12
Just stay home today. Can you do that for me?	6	12
Please try and sleep it off.	6	12
You want to quit in front of Kenny? He hasn't fired a shot.	6	12
Whatever you fellas want.	6	12
Kenny, you need to discharge that weapon...	6	12
before Ray turns us into the Bataan Death March.	6	12
You see that tree over there?	6	12
Pretend it's Ralph Nader and let's go get a drink.	6	12
Wait!	6	12
Oh, shit.	6	12
In recent years, crime in this country...	6	12
has grown nine times as fast as population.	6	12
At the current rate, the crimes of violence in America will double by 1972.	6	12
We cannot accept that kind of future for America.	6	12
We owe it to the decent and law-abiding citizens ofAmerica...	6	12
to take the offensive against the criminal forces...	6	12
that threaten their peace and their security...	6	12
and to rebuild respect for law across this country.	6	12
I pledge to you, the wave of crime...	6	12
is not going to be the wave of the future in America.	6	12
I suppose I'm supposed to believe that you didn't know that she wasn't me...	6	12
when you took her to the boathouse and you had your way.	6	12
I'm talking to you.	6	12
Don't you dare ignore me.	6	12
A lot of people laugh at the idea of a girl playing the tuba.	6	12
- Hello? - It's me.	6	12
Your girl said you were home.	6	12
I am.	6	12
If you're too sick to talk, it can wait.	6	12
I can talk.	6	12
It concerns Sally.	6	12
What about her?	6	12
She's not coming this weekend either.	6	12
Oh. That's too bad.	6	12
Although you should tell her if she does come...	6	12
I'm gonna be working all weekend.	6	12
Why would I tell her that?	6	12
It could have been being held hostage by that burglar...	6	12
or the fight she had with her friend after Model UN...	6	12
but she says she's not going again.	6	12
What do you want me to do about it?	6	12
I don't know that it's a good thing or a bad thing...	6	12
but she wants to go away to a boarding school.	6	12
I'll pay for all of it.	6	12
She has to get in, of course.	6	12
How much does that cost?	6	12
Eleanor, Henry's daughter, went there and I think she'll interview well.	6	12
She has good manners with everyone but me.	6	12
She'll get in.	6	12
I don't know, Don. It is Miss Porter's.	6	12
Jackie Kennedy went there.	6	12
You mean Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.	6	12
What kind of medicine are you taking for this cold?	6	12
Formula 44.	6	12
Yeah, I bet.	6	12
Jackie did well twice.	6	12
So did you.	6	12
- I'm going to go. - Betts...	6	12
will you tell her that Megan-	6	12
That we both miss her?	6	12
Of course.	6	12
Cranberry, Cran-Apple...	6	12
Grape-Berry, that would be Cranprune.	6	12
Don't let the name fool you.	6	12
They're all delicious, my friend.	6	12
Is that the line?	6	12
They are one dried and one fresh fruit for a new generation.	6	12
You want to use Vaughn Meader? I thought they buried that guy with JFK.	6	12
No, there was this old salt who took us around the plant.	6	12
He had a heavy accent and a red shirt.	6	12
Ted called him Rose Kennedy.	6	12
During all this levity, did you mention that Cranprune sounds like a glass of diarrhea?	6	12
When we agreed to take the blends, we agreed to take the names.	6	12
It's got less pucker than the Cranberry, but it's heavier than the Cran-Apple.	6	12
That means Cran-Apple is light.	6	12
Light.	6	12
- And Cranberry is- - Sour?	6	12
- Bitter? - Makes your teeth feel weird?	6	12
It's tart. That's all they keep saying about the berries.	6	12
Yes, they do.	6	12
You know, I hate to say this again, but I got to take a leak.	6	12
Great idea. Peggy.	6	12
You want to get some chowdah?	6	12
Thought you had to pee.	6	12
No, I just wanted to see if I could get him to respond to an idea that wasn't hers.	6	12
You look better.	6	12
Hello?	6	12
I can barely hear you.	6	12
Oh, hello, Harry.	6	12
What?	6	12
Listen, I wouldn't bother you at home.	6	12
Obviously I'm on the Coast, but I've got good news.	6	12
You finally found a hooker who will take traveler's checks?	6	12
Why did I tell you that?	6	12
I got a packet at the desk and then a phone call from Sunkist.	6	12
I told you to drop that.	6	12
Well, Jeffrey, the fat one...	6	12
he finally got a look at the media plan and suddenly they're interested in TV.	6	12
They've called a meeting with Sanford, who I think is a decider.	6	12
Don't do that.	6	12
Don, they're talking about two and a half times the print budget.	6	12
We can't.	6	12
- Why not? - Because we have a conflict.	6	12
Ted has Ocean Spray.	6	12
You should have told them we withdrew.	6	12
Adiós, Harry.	6	12
I really didn't want you to work today.	6	12
Harry is such a pain in the ass.	6	12
Let's get out of here.	6	12
That was really, really scary.	6	12
It was disturbing.	6	12
Hello.	6	12
Oh, hello.	6	12
That was quite a film.	6	12
It was terrifying, wasn't it?	6	12
Well, we were, um-	6	12
You know we're doing the St. Joseph's spot based on it...	6	12
and Peggy and I had an argument about whether there was a Japanese in the end.	6	12
You know, when Mia Farrow walks in and sees the baby...	6	12
and the devil worshippers are there.	6	12
There was.	6	12
I know.	6	12
So you'd both already seen it?	6	12
Yeah. But obviously she remembered it better.	6	12
She wants a Japanese in the ad.	6	12
They always have a camera.	6	12
We're going to grab a bite. Have you eaten?	6	12
I should get going. I have a date.	6	12
Yes, well, don't let us keep you.	6	12
So, Don, I see you're feeling better.	6	12
I had to get him out of the house.	6	12
We can still go eat.	6	12
I am supposed to throw around a football. I should go.	6	12
After you.	6	12
Oh, my God.	6	12
I would never live in an apartment that old.	6	12
There's so many buildings like that in Montreal. It's creepy.	6	12
Don?	6	12
What? I'm gonna have nightmares.	6	12
You know who's not gonna sleep?	6	12
Why are you so interested in this?	6	12
You're not interested?	6	12
Honestly, I'm more troubled by the idea...	6	12
of using Rosemary's Baby for a children's aspirin ad.	6	12
Why were they going to the movies at 5:00?	6	12
They didn't think anybody would be there.	6	12
You've been on a soap too long.	6	12
I don't know. I guess.	6	12
What time is it in California?	6	12
Three hours earlier.	6	12
I need to make a phone call.	6	12
Okay.	6	12
What happened?	6	12
Come in.	6	12
What the hell happened?	6	12
I'm fine. Well, obviously not.	6	12
I thought you were in Detroit.	6	12
I was.	6	12
I told them that Cynthia was pregnant...	6	12
and they took me out to celebrate and they shot me.	6	12
- What? - It's not funny.	6	12
Chevy is killing me.	6	12
I hate Detroit.	6	12
I hate cars. I hate guns.	6	12
I don't even want to look at a steak anymore.	6	12
The only way to get through this is to keep reminding yourself it's a great account.	6	12
I'm gonna be a father. I'm gonna have a family.	6	12
Pull yourself together. Anyone here would trade places with you in a second.	6	12
Did I tell you that on the way to the hospital, they tried to stop for lunch?	6	12
They're fat yahoos in cheap suits. I'm done.	6	12
Are you entertaining this idea?	6	12
You'll be laughed out of this building and then out of advertising in general.	6	12
It'd be a difficult transition.	6	12
Chevy won't like it, but I think they're feeling pretty guilty right now.	6	12
Well, if it's in your power...	6	12
and you're willing to give up what goes with it...	6	12
I would gladly take your place.	6	12
What about your family?	6	12
Trudy and I are separated.	6	12
I only see Tammy every other weekend. She won't know the difference.	6	12
I'm sorry to hear that.	6	12
Yes, it's unfortunate.	6	12
I don't know what to say.	6	12
Say you'll back me up and I'll be there for you.	6	12
Congratulations on the baby.	6	12
Thank you.	6	12
Is he ready?	6	12
- Morning. - Morning.	6	12
- Morning. - Hello.	6	12
We have what we think is some pretty spectacular news.	6	12
Crane called from Los Angeles.	6	12
Sunkist finally looked at the media plan...	6	12
and enthusiastically embraced a television campaign...	6	12
to the tune of eight million dollars.	6	12
Great Caesar's ghost.	6	12
They don't care that we're a month into Ocean Spray?	6	12
Harry said we'd resign.	6	12
Apparently they were excited by the spike in color TVs.	6	12
Don told them that was the secret- color.	6	12
- When did you tell them that? - When we were out there.	6	12
But they wouldn't leave Harry alone.	6	12
You upset, Ted? It's almost three times the business.	6	12
No, I just-	6	12
Well, I'm dreading making the call.	6	12
Well, I'll call Ocean Spray.	6	12
And the rest of our clients?	6	12
Someone has to let them know to look out for a knife in their back.	6	12
You want to turn it down?	6	12
Absolutely not. Don't be an idiot, Ted.	6	12
Stay out of this, Jim.	6	12
Forget about giving someone your word, which obviously doesn't mean anything to you.	6	12
How does it look?	6	12
The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.	6	12
You're right.	6	12
We should work more together. We have to. That's the message from this.	6	12
Then it's agreed that we have a more coherent approach to new business.	6	12
That means no more surprises, Don.	6	12
You're right. I apologize.	6	12
But it's a great account.	6	12
Can we celebrate now?	6	12
I think Peggy should be on it.	6	12
She has, you know, juice experience now.	6	12
That makes sense.	6	12
What are you doing?	6	12
Getting ready to do a little hunting.	6	12
What's going on? Mr. Cooper wants to see you.	6	12
Let's find out.	6	12
That's a.22. It's not good for anything but squirrels, you know.	6	12
Would you ever leave New York, Annie Oakley?	6	12
Hello, Pete.	6	12
Hello, Bob.	6	12
Kenny, how are you feeling?	6	12
Better than I am right now. Have a seat.	6	12
Well, shiver me timbers.	6	12
I'd laugh, but it hurts like a son of a bitch.	6	12
For obvious reasons, Ken is withdrawing from handling Chevy.	6	12
You sure you want to do this?	6	12
I'm positive.	6	12
Kenny, you know, I once had a client cup my wife's breast.	6	12
Lee Garner, Jr. made me hold his balls.	6	12
Well, I'm not resigning Chevy.	6	12
I just can't be on the ground there anymore.	6	12
Pete and I have already discussed it...	6	12
and I will stay on the business in New York.	6	12
They'll want that.	6	12
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't reluctant.	6	12
But I know Ken would do the same for me.	6	12
Crocodile tears. How quaint.	6	12
Look, I know everyone's worried...	6	12
but Bob's going to be a big help with the transition.	6	12
Anything I can do.	6	12
In all deference to the weeks Bob spent trying to develop ties with Chevy...	6	12
I think it's best if I bring in my own team.	6	12
That's a dumb idea.	6	12
Any continuity preserves the belief that service has not changed.	6	12
It's nothing about Bob in particular...	6	12
but isn't it better to create the belief that service has improved?	6	12
Pete, you're going to need to know where the land mines are buried.	6	12
I'd listen to the cyclops, Pete.	6	12
I think maybe I'm keeping you from discussing this freely.	6	12
I understand Pete's objections, but I will do whatever is decided.	6	12
Pete, there's nothing to discuss. I like Bob, Chevy likes Bob.	6	12
And if you don't like Bob, we can find someone who does.	6	12
Of course.	6	12
By the way, thank you, all of you, for having this trust in me.	6	12
Is there a problem?	6	12
I don't want to work with you.	6	12
I don't want to stay in a hotel with you. You're sick.	6	12
Why would you say that?	6	12
So you didn't profess your love to me?	6	12
Only my admiration, which is waning quickly.	6	12
This is not about my own interests. I care about Chevy.	6	12
You should watch what you say to people.	6	12
Is that right?	6	12
Congratulations. Can you believe this guy?	6	12
So?	6	12
So what?	6	12
Can I have one?	6	12
Are you anxious?	6	12
I expect you to sail through this interview.	6	12
Geez, I wasn't nervous about it a minute ago.	6	12
I hope it doesn't ruin it that I'm excited for you.	6	12
When I was in 10th grade, my friend Annie left-	6	12
To go to Rosemary Hall. I know, you told me.	6	12
Did I tell you she hated her mother?	6	12
Good for her.	6	12
Is it about getting away from boys?	6	12
If I say yes, will you stop asking?	6	12
I'm proposing some reasons because you aren't being very forthcoming.	6	12
Sally, I can turn this car around.	6	12
I want to be a grown-up, but I know how important my education is.	6	12
Oh.	6	12
Well, congratulations.	6	12
You log a few months on that, you can work anywhere.	6	12
I'm not looking anymore.	6	12
"So what is this? That old joke- ""Hell, I'm telling everyone""?"	6	12
No, I'm calling on behalf of a young account man...	6	12
whom we love, but can't promote because Draper doesn't like him.	6	12
So you're looking for an account man?	6	12
You know you can't work here.	6	12
I'll be frank.	6	12
I got to get this kid out of here, and he's not going to call you himself.	6	12
I'd love to present some concrete options to him when I push him out the door.	6	12
I just need leads. He doesn't have to land anything.	6	12
He must be pretty good if he's in your way.	6	12
He's eager to please.	6	12
Handsome. His name is Bob Benson.	6	12
He has a blue blood connection to Brown Brothers Harriman.	6	12
Beloit, Wharton. I'll send over his personnel file.	6	12
And I'll send over a bill. Make it an even grand. Cash.	6	12
No, no, no, no.	6	12
- What's going on in there? - Someone's having a good time.	6	12
You do realize this is the best picture these people will ever take?	6	12
We were thinking about putting this old man in a wig...	6	12
because he looks so much like Ruth Gordon.	6	12
- Fill me in. - That's a great idea.	6	12
The conceit is that it's shot from the baby's point of view.	6	12
No, no, let's do the ad for him.	6	12
Joan, come here.	6	12
Can I do it from here?	6	12
No.	6	12
So, Don, you are the camera and the baby.	6	12
We might have the end of the bassinet right at the front of the frame.	6	12
Maybe see some kicking toes under a blanket.	6	12
Should I get down a little lower?	6	12
No, that's fine.	6	12
Okay, it's dark.	6	12
Fish-eye lens, you're the baby.	6	12
"Just, ""Whaa! Whaa!"" You do that."	6	12
Whaa! Whaa! Whaa!	6	12
So there's a crowd. Eight or nine people.	6	12
It's the whole coven. And there's a crazy little old lady.	6	12
What you need is a mustard plaster.	6	12
And then there's this wrinkled old man.	6	12
You need a compress.	6	12
And then a Jewish neighbor lady.	6	12
How about a bowl of chicken soup?	6	12
Anyway, there's one more of those, maybe.	6	12
Then they all start crowding in on you.	6	12
And the Japanese takes a picture and the flash turns it white.	6	12
Then you see the beautiful, radiant young mother.	6	12
You don't need anyone's help but St. Joseph's.	6	12
Usually with things like this, it depends on you knowing the movie.	6	12
But I think this works on its own.	6	12
I told you it was good.	6	12
That's a lot of people.	6	12
You need to feel the conspiracy.	6	12
You want me to come to casting?	6	12
Sure, but I'm just gonna watch. It was all her.	6	12
Casting's on the West Side. You should go.	6	12
That's a lot of people.	6	12
I didn't want to dampen the enthusiasm, but the approved budget is $15,000.	6	12
There's at least $35,000 in residuals alone here.	6	12
- What does St. Joseph's say? - They haven't seen the new budget.	6	12
So who's paying for casting?	6	12
We are.	6	12
But Ted seems confident they'll be good for it.	6	12
So he wants to spring it on them at the pre-pro meeting...	6	12
after we're 10 grand out of pocket?	6	12
I don't know, Don. I don't tell him what to do.	6	12
And Diplomacy Club. I don't know if she told you in the interview...	6	12
but Henry thinks she can be an ambassador one day.	6	12
It's heartwarming to see such a proud mother.	6	12
Well, Sally going away is going to be difficult...	6	12
but, of course, I wanted it for myself way back when.	6	12
And in this day and age, it's overwhelming to raise a young girl...	6	12
let alone be one.	6	12
Beautifully put.	6	12
Now, Sally, during your overnight and tomorrow in class...	6	12
I want you to keep in mind, and I'm sure your mother would agree...	6	12
this is as much for you to find out about us...	6	12
as it is for us to find out about you.	6	12
Carla, could you fetch Millicent Turner from study hall?	6	12
You have fun.	6	12
- I'll be back in the morning around- - 2:30 would be perfect.	6	12
Thank you again.	6	12
Mr. Campbell, your mother is here to see you.	6	12
What are you doing here, Mother?	6	12
Josephine, you have my phone number.	6	12
This doesn't concern her.	6	12
I'm here for my passport.	6	12
I'm planning a voyage. And I spoke to Manolo.	6	12
I forbade you to see him.	6	12
Well, he's very upset about the way you're treating his friend Bob Benson.	6	12
That Spanish fly.	6	12
Why are you still in contact with him?	6	12
- I ran into him. - Where?	6	12
I don't remember.	6	12
Tell Manolo that I almost threw you down the steps when you brought up his friend.	6	12
Peter, I am still your mother.	6	12
I don't have your passport.	6	12
I'm sure it's expired like everything else you own. Josephine!	6	12
You're endangering your position.	6	12
So this used to be the living room.	6	12
And, of course, you have to walk through my room to get to her room...	6	12
but we switch over at Christmas.	6	12
I'd rather have my own room too.	6	12
Oh, hello.	6	12
You must be Sally.	6	12
I'm Mandy. Move over.	6	12
Sally's family lives in Rye and Manhattan.	6	12
Let me guess, dad's remarried, mom's fat and sad.	6	12
No, they're both remarried, but my dad's wife is my age.	6	12
Well, I'd like to feel sorry for you, but things are about to get worse.	6	12
Hmm. Don't you like it here?	6	12
You're not allowed to talk anymore.	6	12
Our opinion is crucial to your acceptance.	6	12
And I can't believe no one told you that you were supposed to look after us.	6	12
You didn't bring a bottle or some cigarettes at least?	6	12
I probably have some money.	6	12
You think we need money?	6	12
You should call your mother. Tell her that you're useless.	6	12
I can get you anything you want.	6	12
She keeps talking.	6	12
Now what do we want?	6	12
How was casting?	6	12
It was interrupted by a phone call from St. Joseph's.	6	12
Did you send over a budget?	6	12
Yes, but relax. I talked to them.	6	12
I played the bad guy. They'll be fine.	6	12
No, they won't be.	6	12
They called me at casting to stop it.	6	12
Now I have to turn a no into a yes.	6	12
You were gonna have to do that anyway.	6	12
I couldn't even tell Peggy.	6	12
Did you tell her how expensive it was?	6	12
It's great work and you know it.	6	12
St. Joseph's has been doing the same ad for 20 years.	6	12
They're bread and butter. Why did you pick them to push?	6	12
"They kept asking me for their ""plop plop fizz fizz."""	6	12
And all of a sudden she comes up with this.	6	12
She can smell the CLIO, Don.	6	12
Remember your first big ad?	6	12
She has her heart set on it.	6	12
It's okay, Ted. I get it.	6	12
You're right. They're coming in tomorrow. Just back me up on this?	6	12
Of course.	6	12
I've got to go over that budget.	6	12
Yeah, she stayed skinny, but her breath smelled like vomit all the time.	6	12
I think it's time for you girls to go to bed.	6	12
You hemmed your skirt.	6	12
My friend Sandy used a stapler.	6	12
Then by the time she went home, her legs were all scratched.	6	12
Stand still. Sally, you there?	6	12
Hello.	6	12
That was pretty fast.	6	12
Hey.	6	12
I'm Mandy and this is Millicent.	6	12
Hold on, do you have a rope for him?	6	12
Millicent, go get him.	6	12
Go around the front.	6	12
Nice digs. I'm Glen, by the way.	6	12
Did you have trouble finding us?	6	12
Rolo's driven by before.	6	12
Then I just looked for Snoopy.	6	12
Do you want a cigarette?	6	12
No, but I wouldn't mind a drink.	6	12
Rolo brought something to smoke.	6	12
How you been? How are your folks?	6	12
Can we drink it straight?	6	12
I know how to make a Tom Collins.	6	12
- She's too much. - She's okay.	6	12
I don't think anyone saw us, but we should keep it quiet.	6	12
I'm Rolo, by the way. Nice digs.	6	12
What about the proctor?	6	12
The housemother's a booze fiend.	6	12
I'll save some for her.	6	12
I want to get stoned.	6	12
I need a surface.	6	12
Here's looking up your old address.	6	12
Hello?	6	12
Look at the two of us, burning the midnight oil.	6	12
Something wrong? Did the messenger find you okay?	6	12
I'm gonna need more than this kid Bob Benson's personnel record.	6	12
Might as well be written in steam.	6	12
What do you mean?	6	12
I don't even know if the name is real.	6	12
I don't know where he went to college, but it wasn't Beloit.	6	12
I tried a buddy at Wharton...	6	12
he said maybe he's just telling people Wharton...	6	12
so he's gonna check the whole University of Pennsylvania.	6	12
But it's tough when I don't know if he's really 28 years old.	6	12
The most interesting is the Brown Brothers Harriman job.	6	12
You told me that.	6	12
I got that from him.	6	12
Well, I have a friend there.	6	12
Turns out they all remember Bobby.	6	12
He's from West Virginia.	6	12
Parents are brother and sister or something.	6	12
He was a manservant for three years to a senior vice president.	6	12
He took him to Europe on the Queen Elizabeth.	6	12
Are you kidding me?	6	12
He had three references...	6	12
two nonworking numbers at K&E and a live one at Cunningham.	6	12
They said he just disappeared one day...	6	12
with an electric pencil sharpener and the Christmas card list.	6	12
So what does that mean?	6	12
Mostly that his only job opportunity...	6	12
was someplace dumb enough not to ask any questions...	6	12
and so far, that's just you guys.	6	12
I'd offer to return the money, but I would file this under valuable information.	6	12
Yes, of course.	6	12
I've never seen anything like this before.	6	12
I have.	6	12
He's a heart patient. He hardly ever gets out of that apartment.	6	12
Well, we call that a DR number these days.	6	12
A DR number.	6	12
You can do that in bed, you know.	6	12
That's right. The Detective division is on the third floor.	6	12
On, no, sir. All divisions- Homicide, Robbery, Burglary. Oh, what's that?	6	12
Yeah, I guess.	6	12
Since seventh grade.	6	12
The Ro is from Ronnie and the Lo is from Lowell.	6	12
So they just started calling me Rolo.	6	12
And 'cause he rolls a lot of joints.	6	12
Should I roll another?	6	12
Your friend bogarted the last one and she didn't get any.	6	12
I'm really drunk.	6	12
You think Millicent's okay?	6	12
She always freaks out.	6	12
What if she runs screaming down the hallway...	6	12
and she thinks her hair is on fire and she's screaming...	6	12
"""Boy on the floor! Boy on the floor""?"	6	12
Do you two know each other?	6	12
I think so, but who knows? I was reincarnated.	6	12
I came back as a fish.	6	12
You should read my diary.	6	12
Come on.	6	12
Nice shot.	6	12
I've got good hands.	6	12
Do you play basketball?	6	12
I've been with lots of girls. I know what I'm doing.	6	12
What kind of music do you like?	6	12
I don't want to talk anymore.	6	12
What's going on, Sally? You called us.	6	12
You made us drive all the way over here.	6	12
Suddenly you don't want to fool around? Are you frigid?	6	12
Glen. Glen, come out.	6	12
Hey, come on. You've got to relax.	6	12
What do you want?	6	12
He won't leave me alone.	6	12
What the hell, Rolo? I told you she's like my sister.	6	12
I think you're full of shit, man.	6	12
You just wanted the good one.	6	12
What is going on?	6	12
He tried to force me.	6	12
What? Damn it, Rolo.	6	12
She's a lying little tease.	6	12
That's bullshit.	6	12
Keep it down.	6	12
Get off me, Bishop.	6	12
Are you suicidal? I'm your ride home.	6	12
He'll be fine. I got to go. I don't want to hitch.	6	12
Are you all right?	6	12
Nice meeting you.	6	12
You too.	6	12
I'm sorry.	6	12
Keep in touch.	6	12
How do you know him?	6	12
We grew up together.	6	12
You like trouble, don't you?	6	12
Good morning.	6	12
Are you joining us?	6	12
Ted wanted more firepower.	6	12
I thought I'd pitch in.	6	12
I don't understand what happened.	6	12
Residuals. Can't let them sneak up on you.	6	12
It'll be fine.	6	12
We always win this one.	6	12
Well, I see everything's in order, including our cookies from Ferrara's.	6	12
Byron, you remember Peggy Olson.	6	12
- Mr. Poole, nice to see you again. - Byron.	6	12
And Don Draper, of course, our other creative director.	6	12
Yes, and I'm sorry about the phone call, but, well, it was a bit of a surprise.	6	12
But you're here and we are going to set you at ease.	6	12
Now Ted and Peggy will take you through the creative process...	6	12
that resulted in this ingenious spot.	6	12
I know what it is. I bought it the day I heard it. I just paid a lot less for it.	6	12
Well, as a concept becomes more developed, expenses can mount.	6	12
We want to do this right.	6	12
The cost is still a fraction of the business we believe it will generate.	6	12
Ted, with all due respect, it's not your job to promise sales.	6	12
It's your job to deliver work for the budget agreed to.	6	12
It turned out to be more people than we thought.	6	12
That's why we sent the budget over.	6	12
We didn't want there to be any surprises.	6	12
But this is worth the money.	6	12
But this is a surprise.	6	12
We agreed to 15,000 and it's 50.	6	12
You said specifically that you wanted something contemporary...	6	12
with a sense of humor...	6	12
something that wouldn't make young parents feel like old people.	6	12
This does that and more.	6	12
That's not a reason.	6	12
Well, it should be.	6	12
We have enough of a history that you should trust my judgment.	6	12
No, I want a reason. I'm entitled.	6	12
You know the raft of shit I caught when this budget came in?	6	12
Mr. Plough called me.	6	12
Uh, I hate to interrupt.	6	12
I think, Byron, I know what you want to hear.	6	12
And it has nothing to do with the shooting days or the cast...	6	12
because you've had a long and fruitful, creative relationship together.	6	12
I think, and correct me if I'm wrong...	6	12
that when you say you want a reason...	6	12
you want to know why we would push you like this.	6	12
It would help.	6	12
Well, the truth is that I don't think Ted wants to say.	6	12
'Cause it's, well...	6	12
it's a little bit personal.	6	12
In fact, it's very personal.	6	12
I'm not sure I know what you mean.	6	12
Yes, you do.	6	12
Are you okay, Ted?	6	12
I, uh-	6	12
It's okay.	6	12
Tell him, Ted.	6	12
You don't want to say anything?	6	12
All right. I'll tell him.	6	12
It's hard for Ted to say...	6	12
but this was Frank Gleason's last idea.	6	12
Really?	6	12
Yes.	6	12
I'm afraid we've gotten a little sentimental.	6	12
Damn. You should have told me that.	6	12
I guess I was- I don't know. I, uh-	6	12
The factor didn't seem relevant except to us. I, um...	6	12
didn't want to lean on that.	6	12
Frank was a hell of a guy. Best I can do is 25.	6	12
I don't care if you make these characters out of cardboard...	6	12
or turn them into cartoons, you got to reduce the cast.	6	12
That's all you get.	6	12
I understand.	6	12
I'll show you out.	6	12
You should come to Piping Rock this Sunday.	6	12
Get in a few holes before all the grass dies.	6	12
We'll see.	6	12
Was that really necessary?	6	12
Leave us alone.	6	12
What was that?	6	12
That was the best I could do.	6	12
Do you want me to tell him the truth?	6	12
What are you talking about?	6	12
You're not thinking with your head.	6	12
That was your solution? Try and embarrass me?	6	12
You're embarrassing yourself.	6	12
I know your little girl has beautiful eyes...	6	12
but that doesn't mean you give her everything.	6	12
That has nothing to do with it.	6	12
Come on, we've all been there. I mean, not with Peggy, but-	6	12
Don't say that about her.	6	12
Ted, you're kidding yourself.	6	12
Everybody sees it. Just ask your secretary.	6	12
Your judgment is impaired.	6	12
You're not thinking with your head.	6	12
Good morning, Bob.	6	12
How you doing, boss?	6	12
I thought for certain you would have brought me a coffee today.	6	12
You want me to go get one?	6	12
I've always wondered how you were so expertly servile.	6	12
But now I know. It used to be your profession.	6	12
What do you want?	6	12
Well, for one thing, I wanted you to stop smiling.	6	12
You got it.	6	12
I've been awake all night wondering what you do when you're found out.	6	12
This must have happened before.	6	12
I don't know what you're talking about.	6	12
- Who hired you? - You did.	6	12
When?	6	12
I met with Ken. You walked in, complimented my tie and walked out.	6	12
It was the best day of my life.	6	12
Well, your fraud is irrefutable.	6	12
Can I have a day's head start?	6	12
Can you give me that at least after all I've done for you?	6	12
You've done more for me than I've done for you.	6	12
Spectacular.	6	12
You don't respond well to gratitude.	6	12
So you're just going to run? I don't believe you.	6	12
It terrifies me what you could do in a day.	6	12
No, Bob, you're going to get the benefit of the fact...	6	12
that I've been here before.	6	12
I don't know how people like you do it.	6	12
You're certainly better at it than I am at whatever I do.	6	12
But I would like to think that I have learned not to tangle with your kind of animal.	6	12
I don't understand.	6	12
Where you are and who you are is not my concern.	6	12
I surrender.	6	12
So what does that mean to me?	6	12
I want you to graciously accept my apologies.	6	12
Work alongside me, but not too closely.	6	12
Again, I don't understand.	6	12
Yes, you do.	6	12
I'm off-limits.	6	12
And please, can you find a way to get your friend out of my mother's life?	6	12
You know she's demented.	6	12
Manolo doesn't like women.	6	12
Make sure.	6	12
Sally.	6	12
What?	6	12
So you got what you wanted and now you think you can be rude.	6	12
Fine.	6	12
I'm not going to tell you what Mrs. Beresford said to me...	6	12
when you were saying good-bye.	6	12
She talked to you?	6	12
She said you were curious and bright...	6	12
and received glowing reports from all concerned.	6	12
But?	6	12
She said a girl like you coming from this family will have plenty of choices...	6	12
and she hopes you choose them.	6	12
Oh.	6	12
Now get me a cigarette and give me some details.	6	12
You want one, don't you?	6	12
Go ahead.	6	12
I'd rather have you do it in front of me than behind my back.	6	12
I'm sure your father has given you a beer.	6	12
My father has never given me anything.	6	12
Did you tell him that I need to see him?	6	12
He went home.	6	12
When?	6	12
Right after I told him you needed to see him.	6	12
I know what you did, I just don't know why you did it.	6	12
Calm down.	6	12
You want to offer me a drink? Pretend like you're helping a little more?	6	12
Close the door.	6	12
Oh, of course. You deserve privacy.	6	12
Look, there's still enough money for the ad. We'll make it work.	6	12
Stop hiding behind the ad.	6	12
I know what you did.	6	12
I saved both of you. How do you think it looks?	6	12
You hate that he is a good man.	6	12
He's not that virtuous.	6	12
He's just in love with you.	6	12
Well, you killed him.	6	12
You killed the ad.	6	12
You killed everything. You can stop now.	6	12
I'm just looking out for the agency.	6	12
You're a monster. 	6	12
- Morning. - Don.	6	13
Can I have a moment?	6	13
I know you're deciding who's gonna be on sunkist,	6	13
So I wanted to volunteer.	6	13
You want to go?	6	13
You know that's a demotion.	6	13
You're gonna be in one room with one account.	6	13
Thought about that, but rather than just being a satellite office,	6	13
I was thinking I could turn it into a little agency.	6	13
Los angeles is not what you see in the movies.	6	13
It's like detroit with palm trees.	6	13
 So it's the frontier.	6	13
I don't even need running water.	6	13
Just let me set up the homestead.	6	13
You think you're asking for a promotion,	6	13
But if you fail there, you'll be out of advertising	6	13
Because no one takes it seriously.	6	13
All I'm saying is that I think it'd be exciting	6	13
To build one desk into a real business.	6	13
That's not the way I saw it.	6	13
That's not the way you saw me.	6	13
And you're gonna change that.	6	13
I've always felt you learn more from disappointment than you do from success.	6	13
Well, I suppose I'm becoming a very wise man.	6	13
- Hello, daddy. - How you doing, sweetie?	6	13
 Oh? Wow.	6	13
- He did get my good side.	6	13
He made it for his generous pop pop.	6	13
Why don't we take you to lunch?	6	13
Come on, honey, I've taken up enough of dad's time.	6	13
I wanted to say thank you,	6	13
But obviously that would be premature.	6	13
It's time to take a breather.	6	13
It's prudent investing, it's not personal.	6	13
No, it is personal. I'm your daughter.	6	13
What do I have to do to get on the list of girls you give money to?	6	13
- Honey. - Don't be a brat.	6	13
Brooks won't say it, but you're taking food out of our mouths.	6	13
Don't even bother to come to thanksgiving.	6	13
The table will be empty.	6	13
Stop it. I'll buy a turkey.	6	13
Sir, she doesn't mean it.	6	13
Mr. Cosgrove is here.	6	13
Send him in.	6	13
Name a chocolate.	6	13
What, like hershey's?	6	13
Kenny, there's a reason I'm standing here.	6	13
Hershey's chocolate sent an rfp out to the top 30 agencies	6	13
And all anyone seems to care about is that we're in the top 30.	6	13
Because hershey's isn't serious.	6	13
They don't advertise. They never have.	6	13
Mars bills at 10 million.	6	13
We think hershey's is asking for someone to talk them into that.	6	13
- What did ted say? - He said his plate is full and yours isn't.	6	13
But if you want to take the lead on this, I think he'll follow.	6	13
I love hershey's.	6	13
Get me in a room.	6	13
I'll get you what they sent me.	6	13
How's the motor city?	6	13
I found a deli, but the airport's like calcutta.	6	13
Should be easier once I get an apartment and stop commuting.	6	13
It's a hell of an account.	6	13
Don't I know it.	6	13
You're back in one piece.	6	13
Oh, one bigger piece. I'm putting on weight.	6	13
- No one can see it. - What's that?	6	13
- It's a racehorse. - It's for kevin.	6	13
Don't do that. He's just gonna want a real one.	6	13
We'll see. They just gave bob one.	6	13
Well, you know what they say about detroit.	6	13
It's all fun and games till they shoot you in the face.	6	13
Aren't we going to have dinner?	6	13
Eventually.	6	13
I'm worried. Now they sent a letter.	6	13
Sally has to call them.	6	13
I'll talk to her at thanksgiving.	6	13
I told you, we just have the boys.	6	13
Miss porter's doesn't have thanksgiving vacation.	6	13
I read the letter.	6	13
The next step is a subpoena.	6	13
Okay.	6	13
Hello.	6	13
You can have one. Then we're having dinner.	6	13
Sounds like a plan.	6	13
Could you get bob benson for me?	6	13
-   Bob benson's here to see you.	6	13
Really? Send him in.	6	13
Were you circling my office?	6	13
- I don't understand. - Sit down.	6	13
It occurred to me that you haven't had a performance review.	6	13
Yes, I did. Didn't mr. Cutler tell you--	6	13
I don't give a shit.	6	13
You have a hand on every rung, don't you?	6	13
I don't think I know what you're talking about.	6	13
What are you doing buying presents for that kid?	6	13
Leading that woman on? That's another man's kid. You know that?	6	13
I assure you, I'm not involved with joan.	6	13
We're just buddies.	6	13
joan's known for having a lot of buddies.	6	13
They go fishing together.	6	13
What does this have to do with my performance?	6	13
I'm asking the questions here. I see what you're up to.	6	13
Look, I know that you're concerned with your career	6	13
And chevy's counting on you being a family man,	6	13
But playing with mrs. Harris' feelings	6	13
Is not the right way to go about it.	6	13
- You're right. - Damn it, bob, I better not be.	6	13
I'm keeping an eye on you.	6	13
I appreciate your candor.	6	13
I'm looking forward to having you out in detroit, bob.	6	13
Yes, sir. Thank you.	6	13
This is sally draper speaking.	6	13
It's daddy.	6	13
What do you want?	6	13
I wanted to wish you a happy thanksgiving.	6	13
Okay. I have to go.	6	13
Also, I'm calling because--	6	13
Well, I know it's unpleasant,	6	13
But you have to give a statement regarding the burglar.	6	13
You need to make arrangements to be out of classes December 1st.	6	13
My calendar is full.	6	13
Honey, you have to. It's the law.	6	13
Well, I wouldn't want to do anything immoral.	6	13
You know what?	6	13
Why don't you just tell them what I saw?	6	13
Hello?	6	13
I've got it, moira. I have a personal plea.	6	13
Is this about hershey again?	6	13
No, the folks from sheraton are in the lobby.	6	13
Royal hawaiian. We can't find draper.	6	13
Again?	6	13
"""band of gold"" playing"	6	13
You don't have to listen, but I have to say it.	6	13
We're all brothers in christ.	6	13
That's his gift to us.	6	13
We're talking about a fellowship far more powerful than drink.	6	13
Can you keep it down? I'm trying to drink.	6	13
What's your occupation, young man?	6	13
Staying out of people's business.	6	13
You're not doing a very good job of it.	6	13
I didn't mean to engage you.	6	13
But you did.	6	13
'cause something's on your mind.	6	13
You need to talk.	6	13
I don't.	6	13
What if I told you	6	13
That jesus could offer you not only eternal life,	6	13
But freedom from pain in this life?	6	13
I'm doing just fine.	6	13
Nixon's the president.	6	13
Everything's back where jesus wants it.	6	13
He doesn't work that way.	6	13
'cause he's mysterious.	6	13
He offer the same deal to kennedy?	6	13
Martin luther king? Vietnam, for christ's sake?	6	13
Studies show jesus had a bad year.	6	13
Well, I'm afraid there's not one true believer in that list.	6	13
What the hell did you just say?	6	13
I told you before to get out and not come back.	6	13
- Be on your way. - This is a house of sin.	6	13
You can't keep these girls from the righteous path.	6	13
- They belong to the lord. - You're wrong on that.	6	13
You love the bible 'cause you can't get your dick hard.	6	13
Repentance is your salvation.	6	13
I'd tell you to go to hell, but I never want to see you again.	6	13
The only unpardonable sin	6	13
Is to believe god cannot forgive you.	6	13
Excuse me. Hey.	6	13
- I shouldn't be in here. - Guard: You're right.	6	13
You punched a minister. You should be in rikers.	6	13
- Sleep it off.	6	13
Absolutely not.	6	13
You'll have candy at the theater.	6	13
- Oh, hello, peggy. - Hello.	6	13
Good night.	6	13
Come on, boys. Let's go.	6	13
Clara, I'm going to give my keys to the subletter.	6	13
Did you get me a room at the roosevelt?	6	13
Yes, and you just got this telegram.	6	13
Open it.	6	13
Let's see.	6	13
"""need to inform you, mother lost at--"""	6	13
Oh, my goodness. She fell off a ship!	6	13
What?	6	13
Get bud on the phone.	6	13
I assume this has something to do with last night.	6	13
Yes.	6	13
Megan, I--	6	13
Come over here.	6	13
Where were you?	6	13
I spent the night in jail.	6	13
Why are you laughing?	6	13
because I realized	6	13
It's gotten out of control.	6	13
I've gotten out of control.	6	13
Sorry you had to find out that way.	6	13
But I realized something else, too.	6	13
I don't want to be here anymore.	6	13
- It'll get easier. - No.	6	13
I want to move to california.	6	13
What?	6	13
I don't want you to give up your career.	6	13
I don't want you to think that.	6	13
I just can't be in new york anymore.	6	13
I want to move to l.A.	6	13
I don't--	6	13
I don't know what to say.	6	13
There have been all these opportunities in hollywood,	6	13
But I never even considered it	6	13
Because I thought it would make you go crazy.	6	13
But-- I mean, wouldn't it?	6	13
What would you do out there?	6	13
Sunkist wants us to have someone local.	6	13
It could be like having my own shop.	6	13
A small team, a desk,	6	13
Windows, some sunlight,	6	13
The ocean.	6	13
You'd throw everything away here?	6	13
No.	6	13
It's an opportunity	6	13
To build one desk	6	13
Into an agency.	6	13
We'd be homesteaders.	6	13
Really, don?	6	13
What about the kids?	6	13
I'm sure they'd trade weekends	6	13
For a whole summer in l.A.	6	13
We were happy there.	6	13
We could be happy again.	6	13
Is that a yes?	6	13
This was to be a junior position.	6	13
Look, I'm the search party	6	13
And I decided we were thinking too small.	6	13
Well, I think we can spare you.	6	13
I apologize for sheraton, ted.	6	13
That won't happen again.	6	13
That's my recommendation.	6	13
Of course I welcome a vote on the matter.	6	13
How is it every decision made in this place	6	13
Is subject to 10 opinions unless it's him?	6	13
What if we need him here?	6	13
It's california, not the moon.	6	13
There are telephones and airplanes.	6	13
You're already doing the heavy lifting.	6	13
This is good for you, ted.	6	13
Honestly, I have bigger problems than this.	6	13
Dawn, could you bring me a carton of cigarettes?	6	13
You didn't think ahead.	6	13
You let her go and yet you still need something.	6	13
- She's not going anywhere. - But you are.	6	13
California, here you come.	6	13
You probably dictated the memo right to her	6	13
And had no idea she'd be affected.	6	13
Hold on a second.	6	13
I was gonna talk to you.	6	13
Really? Why? You don't owe me anything.	6	13
I can probably get you out there eventually.	6	13
To work for you? No, I'd rather stay here.	6	13
Where are you going?	6	13
I'm gonna have that sandwich on my desk.	6	13
I need to get to it before you do.	6	13
Are you kidding me? They got married?	6	13
What the hell was he even doing there?	6	13
- ( knocks ) - you should really get going.	6	13
You tell those panamanian criminals they should put manolo under house arrest.	6	13
Or ship's arrest or whatever it's called.	6	13
Fine, the brig.	6	13
Do whatever it takes.	6	13
- What's wrong? - Get me bob benson this minute.	6	13
He was waiting for you. You're late for your flight to detroit.	6	13
Hold that.	6	13
- How are you? - Not great, bob.	6	13
- What's wrong? - What's wrong?	6	13
Don't play dumb.	6	13
You don't know that your boyfriend manolo kidnapped my mother,	6	13
Married her at gunpoint, then threw her off a ship?!	6	13
Slow down.	6	13
I know you're exaggerating and you're being hostile.	6	13
If you want to run, I'd do it now.	6	13
Because you're an accessory to murder.	6	13
I will never, ever let this go.	6	13
Manny wouldn't hurt a fly.	6	13
Even if he thought it was rich?	6	13
I swear I knew nothing about this.	6	13
Ignorance will not be a very good defense.	6	13
Get your own cab.	6	13
I'm leaving a little early because I have plans.	6	13
I hope that's okay.	6	13
Yes, of course, dear.	6	13
Chanel no. 5?	6	13
It's all I wear.	6	13
Vixen by night.	6	13
Pete: I'm very excited to see the scale model.	6	13
And I'm even more excited to go to the london chop house.	6	13
Bob loves it.	6	13
Well, unfortunately bob's not feeling well.	6	13
Pete, have you seen this beauty?	6	13
No, not in the flesh.	6	13
That's a camaro z28. Am I wrong?	6	13
No, you are not.	6	13
I like a man with gasoline in his veins.	6	13
- You've got to try it. - We can't do that in here.	6	13
I did. Last week.	6	13
Shit, it's our floor. We can do whatever the hell we want.	6	13
Keys are under the visor.	6	13
Go to town.	6	13
Bobby, you like to get into trouble, don't you?	6	13
It's standard.	6	13
So is the solid-lifter 302 v-8.	6	13
Listen to that music.	6	13
That's good enough for me.	6	13
Ah, take it out. Come on, boys, back up.	6	13
You looking for first?	6	13
It's written right on there.	6	13
I got it, bob.	6	13
Jesus, you can't drive a stick?	6	13
We'll pay for that.	6	13
What are you doing here?	6	13
Waiting for you.	6	13
I told your neighbors I was a cop.	6	13
You should go home before they kill you.	6	13
I need to talk to you.	6	13
How was your date?	6	13
Is that why you're here?	6	13
I just want to know.	6	13
You didn't bring him home.	6	13
It was terrible, okay?	6	13
He works in finance and ate with his hands.	6	13
Not that it's any of your business.	6	13
I don't know what we're doing.	6	13
You don't know?	6	13
Why don't you have your wife drop by again?	6	13
- I'd love that. - She came in with the kids.	6	13
Why did she give me that look on the way out?	6	13
Did you tell her something? Do you two talk about me?	6	13
I don't know why women do anything.	6	13
Why did you parade your ass in front of my door	6	13
On your way out to see another man?	6	13
I'm following your lead, ted.	6	13
You let don terrify you into ignoring me and now you're here.	6	13
Because I don't want anyone else to have you.	6	13
You should go.	6	13
Peggy, I'm going to leave my wife.	6	13
Don't say that.	6	13
I'm not that girl.	6	13
I love you.	6	13
Hello?	6	13
I just got off the phone with miss porter's.	6	13
Sally's been suspended.	6	13
"She bought beer using the name ""beth francis"""	6	13
With a false id she'd made.	6	13
Kids do things, betty. At least they didn't kick her out.	6	13
Henry's already in albany.	6	13
I'm supposed to join him tomorrow.	6	13
I know you're picking the boys up thanksgiving day,	6	13
But could you go get her tomorrow?	6	13
They're holding her in the infirmary.	6	13
I don't want to have this conversation with my mother-in-law.	6	13
I can't, betty. I have a big meeting.	6	13
She was drunk.	6	13
And she got other girls drunk.	6	13
I've done everything I can think to do,	6	13
Everything my own mother did,	6	13
And it doesn't matter.	6	13
The good is not beating the bad.	6	13
She obviously needs more than I can give her.	6	13
Birdie, this isn't your fault.	6	13
Don, she's from a broken home.	6	13
Pauline doesn't need to know.	6	13
I'll come get them thanksgiving morning	6	13
And then I'll come get her.	6	13
Okay.	6	13
I'm sorry.	6	13
Is everything okay?	6	13
No.	6	13
Is there anything I can do?	6	13
Let's go to hawaii.	6	13
For work?	6	13
For christmas.	6	13
We'll come back with tans.	6	13
You should probably go home.	6	13
I don't want to.	6	13
I can say I worked late on hershey.	6	13
Don't you always go home, though?	6	13
I don't want to sneak around.	6	13
I promise we won't have to.	6	13
I don't want a scandal.	6	13
I can wait.	6	13
Go.	6	13
No, you should go.	6	13
Oh, good, you're home.	6	13
Yeah, I didn't want to wake you.	6	13
Come to bed.	6	13
Okay.	6	13
Oh, sweetheart, you're working too hard.	6	13
What are you doing back?	6	13
- You haven't heard? - Heard what?	6	13
I need a place to live.	6	13
I spoke with the gm personnel department.	6	13
No, here in new york.	6	13
I'm done in detroit and the tenant's already moved in.	6	13
Oh.	6	13
Your brother's been trying desperately to reach you.	6	13
Did they find her?	6	13
well, let him know I'm back.	6	13
I'm gonna be gone for a couple of hours.	6	13
Roger needs me to go to the bank before the holiday.	6	13
You want someone on his desk?	6	13
I'm not sure he's coming in.	6	13
- I'm worried about him. - What's wrong?	6	13
For one thing, margaret and the son-in-law are bleeding him dry.	6	13
Trust me, he loves it.	6	13
Well, he's forlorn.	6	13
I'd invite him to my place for thanksgiving,	6	13
But ralph stopped drinking and you know little ralphie's spastic.	6	13
I think both are too much for him.	6	13
Mr. Draper.	6	13
Mr. Chaough's here to see you.	6	13
Send him in.	6	13
- I need to talk to you. - I was thinking the same thing.	6	13
You should come to hershey's since I'm going to california.	6	13
That's not why I'm here.	6	13
Do you want something?	6	13
No, thank you.	6	13
I don't know how to say this,	6	13
But I want to go to california.	6	13
Really? We can't both go.	6	13
I know. I want you to stay here.	6	13
You put all that energy and optimism back into the business	6	13
And let me go out there.	6	13
I'm the one who needs to start over.	6	13
With peggy?	6	13
No, with my family.	6	13
I don't understand.	6	13
Yes, you do.	6	13
It's my only chance, don.	6	13
I've got kids.	6	13
I can't throw this away. I can't--	6	13
I can't go on like this.	6	13
I'm sorry, ted. I wish I could help you.	6	13
I don't know what I brought out in you,	6	13
But I know there's a good man in there.	6	13
I need you to help me	6	13
Put 3,000 miles between me and her	6	13
Or my life is over.	6	13
I didn't make my decision lightly.	6	13
I need it, too.	6	13
And, frankly, they're writing my wife off her show.	6	13
It's too late, ted.	6	13
It will go away.	6	13
Will you have a drink before the meeting?	6	13
My father was-- you can't stop cold like that.	6	13
Every agency you're going to meet with feels qualified	6	13
To advertise the hershey bar	6	13
Because the product itself	6	13
Is one of the most successful billboards of all time.	6	13
And its relationship with america	6	13
Is so overwhelmingly positive	6	13
That everyone in this room has their own story to tell.	6	13
It could be rations in the heat of battle	6	13
Or in the movie theater on a first date.	6	13
But most of them are from childhood.	6	13
Mine was my father	6	13
Taking me to the drugstore after I'd mowed the lawn	6	13
And telling me I could have anything I wanted.	6	13
Anything at all. And there was a lot.	6	13
But I picked a hershey bar.	6	13
The wrapper looked like what was inside.	6	13
And as I ripped it open,	6	13
My father tousled my hair and forever	6	13
His love and the chocolate	6	13
Were tied together.	6	13
That's the story we're going to tell.	6	13
Hershey's is the currency of affection.	6	13
It's the childhood symbol of love.	6	13
Well, weren't you a lucky little boy?	6	13
Our company excels in television	6	13
And we'll tell you exactly when and where to tell those stories.	6	13
Sweet tales of childhood.	6	13
I suppose we'd start with yours.	6	13
Roger: You can't just have that. You got to pay us first.	6	13
And that's what's so exciting.	6	13
I'm sorry, I have to say this	6	13
'cause I don't know if I'll ever see you again.	6	13
What?	6	13
I was an orphan.	6	13
I grew up in pennsylvania...	6	13
In a whorehouse.	6	13
I read about milton hershey and his school	6	13
"In ""coronet"" magazine or some other crap"	6	13
The girls left by the toilet.	6	13
And I read that some orphans	6	13
Had a different life there.	6	13
I could picture it.	6	13
I dreamt of it--	6	13
Of being wanted.	6	13
Because the woman who was forced to raise me	6	13
Would look at me every day	6	13
Like she hoped I would disappear.	6	13
Closest I got to feeling wanted	6	13
Was from a girl	6	13
Who made me go through her john's pockets	6	13
While they screwed.	6	13
If I collected more than a dollar, she'd buy me a hershey bar.	6	13
And I would eat it alone	6	13
In my room	6	13
With great ceremony...	6	13
feeling like a normal kid.	6	13
"It said ""sweet"" on the package."	6	13
It was the only sweet thing in my life.	6	13
Do you want to advertise that?	6	13
If I had my way, you would never advertise.	6	13
You shouldn't have someone like me	6	13
Telling that boy what a hershey bar is.	6	13
He already knows.	6	13
Don's being modest.	6	13
But it's just this kind of theater	6	13
That makes our work so different.	6	13
Well, that's quite a story.	6	13
It was a pleasure meeting you.	6	13
Stop you from going to some of these other meetings.	6	13
Ted...?	6	13
- It was a pleasure. - Yes.	6	13
You're going to california.	6	13
Are you sure?	6	13
I want you to.	6	13
Thank you.	6	13
Dawn, get my things.	6	13
You know, you shit the bed in there.	6	13
- I don't care. - Was any of that true?	6	13
Yes. I have to go home.	6	13
Happy thanksgiving, sweetheart.	6	13
You, too, mr. Draper.	6	13
So your mother likely went missing over the promenade.	6	13
It's the only way she wouldn't have hit a deck below.	6	13
No, where was the boat?	6	13
Oh, somewhere off the coast of martinique.	6	13
Did they check the beaches?	6	13
Well, first of all, there are a lot of sharks.	6	13
As I said, there's no impetus for either government to investigate	6	13
And the ss sunset princess in contacting you	6	13
Has fulfilled its obligation.	6	13
It's 1968.	6	13
Surely you're not telling me	6	13
There's still some international oceanic limbo	6	13
I have a private investigator prepared to board the ship	6	13
And locate your mother's husband-- well, nurse--	6	13
Manolo col?n, alias marcus constantine.	6	13
We also have wheels we can grease in panama.	6	13
No stone unturned, no expense spared.	6	13
Ahem, let's say we want the very best of everything.	6	13
What are the expenses?	6	13
To bring your mother's killer to justice?	6	13
- Ballpark. - It may take time.	6	13
Now that manolo's aware of her limited financial resources, he may bolt.	6	13
Alvin, I have another call coming in.	6	13
Can we continue this later?	6	13
When you think about it,	6	13
It won't bring her back.	6	13
She's in the water	6	13
With father.	6	13
She loved the sea.	6	13
I didn't want to disturb you.	6	13
What happened?	6	13
I don't even know how to say this.	6	13
Did you tell nan?	6	13
Did you confess? I told you to wait.	6	13
No, that's--	6	13
I'm going to california.	6	13
You can stay here and have your life	6	13
And your career and let this be the past.	6	13
I can't believe don did this.	6	13
I knew he wasn't going. He knows it's siberia.	6	13
- I can undo this. - No, peggy.	6	13
He gave up his spot for me.	6	13
Don?	6	13
I wanted this so much, but I have a family.	6	13
The world out there...	6	13
I have to hold onto them	6	13
Or I'll get lost in the chaos.	6	13
Oh.	6	13
You have to listen to me.	6	13
I love you that deeply.	6	13
I can't be around you.	6	13
And I can't ruin all those lives.	6	13
Get out. Just get out.	6	13
Someday you'll be glad I made this decision.	6	13
Well, aren't you lucky to have decisions?	6	13
Dawn just called. She said there's a partners' meeting	6	13
Tomorrow about california.	6	13
Attendance is mandatory. 9:00.	6	13
You have a meeting on thanksgiving.	6	13
They must really want us out of here fast.	6	13
Honey.	6	13
You have to sit down.	6	13
Why?	6	13
Because something came up.	6	13
And it's not just sally, it's--	6	13
It's what?	6	13
I'm sorry, but we can't go to california right now.	6	13
No, don, that's--	6	13
That's not possible	6	13
Because I already told mel	6	13
And jeff hunter's got me a bunch of meetings out there	6	13
- And the train is leaving the station. - The agency decided that--	6	13
the agency. I quit my job.	6	13
Megan.	6	13
You know what?	6	13
I don't even know why we're fighting for this anymore.	6	13
I don't know what it is.	6	13
We don't have any kids.	6	13
You wato be alone with your liquor	6	13
And your ex-wife and your screwed-up kids.	6	13
Don't say that.	6	13
I love them to death.	6	13
I used to feel pity for them,	6	13
But now I realize we're all in the same boat.	6	13
I know you're upset.	6	13
But I'm gonna be out there all the time with you.	6	13
We'll be bicoastal.	6	13
Megan, I love you.	6	13
I can't do this.	6	13
I can't be here right now.	6	13
They'll deliver the lowboy	6	13
And the china closet next Friday.	6	13
I couldn't take any more	6	13
And I already look like the beverly hillbillies	6	13
I don't want your mother's things, peter.	6	13
Well, bud's not getting everything.	6	13
And I'm not moving everything to california with me.	6	13
It's fine. I'll manage.	6	13
When are you leaving for your parents'?	6	13
When tammy finishes her nap.	6	13
When are you leaving for los angeles?	6	13
Soon as I can.	6	13
I'd invite you, but I think it's best you're alone right now.	6	13
- Don't be cruel. - No.	6	13
It's going to take you a moment to realize where you are.	6	13
You're free.	6	13
Free of her. You're free of them.	6	13
You're free of everything.	6	13
It's not the way I wanted it.	6	13
Now you know that.	6	13
Can I go in and say goodbye? I won't wake her.	6	13
I was told 9:00.	6	13
Right on time. Impressive.	6	13
Don, we need to have a serious conversation.	6	13
Where would you like to do it?	6	13
Is this about the hershey meeting yesterday?	6	13
Because I can explain.	6	13
Well, unfortunately, that meeting	6	13
And most of your questionable behavior is beyond explanation.	6	13
Should I sit down?	6	13
Yes.	6	13
I'm not going to defend myself.	6	13
I've tolerated plenty from every one of you.	6	13
Don, there's no need for defense.	6	13
This isn't a trial.	6	13
The verdict has been reached.	6	13
So what time did this meeting start?	6	13
We think it's best for you and the firm	6	13
If you take some time off and regroup.	6	13
- How much time? - A few months.	6	13
But the holidays are coming. That'll take up most of it.	6	13
Did you tell ted?	6	13
'cause he can't go to california if there's no one here to run new york.	6	13
Ted feels confident he can oversee peggy from l.A.	6	13
He knows it's temporary.	6	13
I want a return date.	6	13
We can't give you that.	6	13
You all agree with this?	6	13
Try and see it from our side.	6	13
- Good morning. - Hello, don.	6	13
You're early.	6	13
Sorry about that, old chum.	6	13
This is lou avery from dancer fitzgerald.	6	13
We've met.	6	13
Going down?	6	13
"""moon river"" playing"	6	13
What's that?	6	13
We couldn't send it back.	6	13
- Hey. - What?	6	13
Happy holidays.	6	13
What's he doing here?	6	13
I'm inviting you into kevin's life,	6	13
Not mine.	6	13
Okay.	6	13
Hi, bob.	6	13
Mom, roger's here.	6	13
Gail got her hair done for you.	6	13
Hello, little man.	6	13
- You ready for some turkey? - Yes.	6	13
Here, let me get it for you.	6	13
I thought you left.	6	13
No, I've got too much to do.	6	13
And you thought you'd do it in here?	6	13
It's where everything is.	6	13
See you Monday.	6	13
"Did they name it ""hershey"" because of the chocolate"	6	13
Or is the chocolate named after the city?	6	13
There was a man named hershey.	6	13
He made enough chocolate to build a town.	6	13
Why are we stopping?	6	13
This is a bad neighborhood.	6	13
Come on.	6	13
This is where I grew up.	6	13
"""both sides now"" playing"	6	13
rows and flows of angel hair 	6	13
and ice cream castles in the air 	6	13
and feather canyons everywhere 	6	13
I've looked at clouds that way 	6	13
but now they only block the sun 	6	13
they rain and snow on everyone 	6	13
so many things I would have done 	6	13
but clouds got in my way 	6	13
I've looked at clouds from both sides now 	6	13
from up and down and still somehow 	6	13
it's cloud illusions I recall 	6	13
I really don't know clouds 	6	13
at all	6	13
moons and junes and ferris wheels 	6	13
the dizzy dancing way you feel 	6	13
when every fairy tale comes real 	6	13
I've looked at love that way 	6	13
but now it's just another show 	6	13
you leave 'em laughing when you go... 	6	13
Ripped By mstoll	7	1
Are you ready?	7	1
Because I want you to pay attention.	7	1
This is the beginning of something.	7	1
Do you have time to improve your life?	7	1
Do you have precisely 30 seconds	7	1
for a word from Accutron Watches?	7	1
The watch appears bottom third.	7	1
The second hand moves with a fluid sweep	7	1
"and above it-- ""Accutron Time."""	7	1
You go into a business meeting.	7	1
 Is there food in your teeth? Ashes on your tie?	7	1
And you've got nothing to say.	7	1
The meeting is boring, but you can't be.	7	1
But you're wearing an Accutron.	7	1
This watch makes you interesting.	7	1
It's a boardroom. It's black and white.	7	1
We hear light traffic. No talking.	7	1
We just see our man, you, late 20s,	7	1
shaggy with a youthful cowlick, but in a suit and tie.	7	1
This is a businessman staring at his watch	7	1
as muffled conversation swirls around him.	7	1
Now we just hear the electronic hum.	7	1
Omm-mm.	7	1
He stands up and the faces come into view.	7	1
 A couple of white-haired men	7	1
and a contemporary who looks like Steve McQueen.	7	1
"You shake hands and ""Steve McQueen"" gets a look at your watch."	7	1
We hear the first words.	7	1
"""Is that Swiss?"""	7	1
Now we're in color	7	1
and it's a little interview for the two of them	7	1
while the other men look, outlining the benefits of this watch.	7	1
It is Swiss. It is accurate.	7	1
It is the height of design and technology.	7	1
"""Accutron. It's not a timepiece."	7	1
"It's a conversation piece."""	7	1
Wow, Freddy.	7	1
That's a home run.	7	1
Actually, it's kind of an end run.	7	1
That is not what I expected.	7	1
There's a nice way to say that	7	1
and there's the way you just said it.	7	1
Well, it's really good.	7	1
They're going to resist that black and white thing.	7	1
Yeah, but nobody's done it. Not that I know of.	7	1
"""Accutron, it's time for a conversation."""	7	1
It's not as dramatic and it hides the benefit.	7	1
I don't know. It sounds more elegant to me.	7	1
Yes?	7	1
You wanted me to tell you when it was five minutes	7	1
until the status meeting.	7	1
Thank you, Shirley.	7	1
So, I'll see you next week.	7	1
I'm gonna have another cup of coffee.	7	1
"You really put the ""free"" in freelancer, don't you?"	7	1
Ahem. Hello?	7	1
Hello, Daddy.	7	1
Oh.	7	1
How are you, honey?	7	1
I'm well.	7	1
I thought I'd catch you before you went to the office.	7	1
Right.	7	1
I'd like to have brunch Sunday morning.	7	1
Sure. That'd be nice.	7	1
I'll bring vodka. We'll have Bloody Marys.	7	1
No, in a restaurant.	7	1
How about the Plaza? They have vodka.	7	1
It'll just be me.	7	1
Sounds touching.	7	1
10:30. Bye-bye.	7	1
Bye, honey.	7	1
I feel like we really got somewhere last night.	7	1
Hello, Dawn.	7	1
- Gentlemen. - The team is here.	7	1
Fire when ready.	7	1
How long is this meeting?	7	1
That depends on you, doesn't it?	7	1
Who do we have here? Gladys Knight and the Pips?	7	1
That's very hip, Lou.	7	1
- Should I get the door, Lou? - Yes, Nurse.	7	1
So, how is everybody today?	7	1
Ready for your routine checkup?	7	1
"Just open your mouths and say ""ahh."""	7	1
Gentlemen.	7	1
Get me those brand reviews.	7	1
It's a deadline, knuckleheads!	7	1
You know what it says to me?	7	1
It says you don't care.	7	1
And anybody who doesn't care doesn't have to work here!	7	1
And you do not have the weekend!	7	1
- I can come back. - No.	7	1
Clara, can I get a buttered roll, please, from the lobby?	7	1
Yes, of course.	7	1
Come on in.	7	1
What are you holding?	7	1
It's Avon. You said you wanted to see me.	7	1
How many accounts do I have?	7	1
Well, it's all of them.	7	1
It feels like more.	7	1
I'm walking into this office every day and I barely get ahead of things	7	1
before I get Bob from Detroit around noon	7	1
and Pete from LA around 2:00.	7	1
Is this Avon related,	7	1
or did you just need someone to hand you a tissue?	7	1
I have no real help except Torkelson, who's Cutler's guy.	7	1
And I think he's making Clara nightly.	7	1
- That's juicy. - He can have her.	7	1
The point is Butler Footwear just hired a new head of marketing	7	1
and if I meet with him, it's a demotion.	7	1
You're head of accounts. He'll think he's important.	7	1
That's what it looks like to him.	7	1
But to Charles Butler Jr., it looks like I'm only as important	7	1
as his head of marketing.	7	1
If I have no underlings, I'm useless.	7	1
Have Roger or Cutler meet with him.	7	1
That's two dumb ideas. You're not listening to me.	7	1
This is a hierarchy. Do you understand that?	7	1
Tell him I couldn't make it at the last minute.	7	1
I'm having dinner with Jerry Lewis or GM or somebody.	7	1
No, don't mention other clients.	7	1
Certainly.	7	1
I appreciate your confidence in me.	7	1
- Make him go away.	7	1
I have your roll and I have Bob Benson on the line.	7	1
You see this? I don't have time to take a crap.	7	1
And last but not least,	7	1
any news from the Motor City?	7	1
Chevy XP collateral is scheduled to go to press Monday.	7	1
- Hallelujah. - But we don't have approved copy.	7	1
We don't even have a name for it.	7	1
Dang it.	7	1
Chevy graphics people keep telling me	7	1
"there's a ""Chevy way"" of doing things."	7	1
- And money is no object. - Get it in writing.	7	1
You didn't pick an angle for Accutron.	7	1
Wow, is that today?	7	1
Sure, I did. Dawn, what did I say?	7	1
"""Just in time to be on time."""	7	1
That wasn't one of the choices. I think that was a digression.	7	1
"How about ""Accutron is accurate""?"	7	1
That was one of the choices, I'm positive.	7	1
"""It's time for a conversation."""	7	1
I think that one's more finished.	7	1
And I think you're putting me in a position of saying	7	1
I don't care what you think.	7	1
Why would you put something in front of me	7	1
that you don't want me to pick?	7	1
Because you told me to give you two ideas.	7	1
You apparently only gave me one.	7	1
Last week I gave you 30 choices and you told me to bring you two.	7	1
That's the way we do it.	7	1

Oh, Moira, can you remind me to pick up	7	1
two dozen bagels before the end of my trip?	7	1
Aha.	7	1
So, the missus misses New York.	7	1
No, they are for Pete. Nan loves California.	7	1

"""Dream For Sale"" playing in background"	7	1
That's what I've been saying.	7	1
I know. Okay, Ira. I've got to go.	7	1
Hello, Alan.	7	1
I'm sorry, I think I'm a little early.	7	1
First actress ever to say that.	7	1
You look wonderful, honey.	7	1
- Don Draper, this is Alan Silver. - Don't get up.	7	1
The husband is a matinee idol.	7	1
I told you.	7	1
Don, I want to get one thing out of the way.	7	1
Know that it was important to me	7	1
that you know the man your wife is spending so much time with.	7	1
I assure you, it's greed and nothing else.	7	1
I feel completely at ease.	7	1
My partners in New York promise a lot of things to girls	7	1
when they come West.	7	1
They passed off a lot of dogs.	7	1
But your girl is something.	7	1
I mean, she's the kind of girl who's gonna shine for the network	7	1
"in her callback for the ""Bracken's World"" pilot."	7	1
What? Get out of here.	7	1
I will not.	7	1
I thought the guy hated me.	7	1
But his boss loved you.	7	1
I'll say one thing about this girl,	7	1
she evokes strong feelings.	7	1
I feel like I just ate a bag of butterflies.	7	1
Let's celebrate.	7	1
Young man.	7	1
Let me get a bottle of French champagne	7	1
for my French TV star here.	7	1
I can't believe it. When is it?	7	1
Wednesday, 9:15. We can hold off on fixing your teeth.	7	1
Obviously I jumped the gun on that.	7	1
Okay.	7	1
What network?	7	1
NBC.	7	1
Such great news, honey.	7	1
Look at you two.	7	1
You're my favorite couple.	7	1
- Mr. Barnes? Wayne? - That's me.	7	1
I'm Joan Harris from SC&P.	7	1
Should I tell them that we're ready for a table?	7	1
Maybe we should wait for Ken.	7	1
Please, sit.	7	1
- What can I get you? - I'll have a Coke.	7	1
Two Cokes.	7	1
I'm so sorry.	7	1
Ken was called away on an emergency	7	1
and rather than risk cancelling on someone so important,	7	1
he asked that I stand in.	7	1
Look, I must be crazy to be disappointed.	7	1
I'm sure you had a hard time keeping this seat empty,	7	1
but this conversation is best for Ken.	7	1
Tell me about your new position.	7	1
Head of marketing.	7	1
That's not just new for you, that's new for Butler Footwear.	7	1
They pay me to think about the four Ps--	7	1
price, product, place, and promotion.	7	1
- Thank you. - That's a smart way to think about it.	7	1
I have a degree in business.	7	1
It's not a science, but we try to make it one.	7	1
Advertising is just a small piece of the marketing mixture	7	1
and it might be more effective if it's better integrated	7	1
into our business.	7	1
So are you thinking about bringing	7	1
one of our account executives into your office?	7	1
Actually, I'd like to move all our advertising in-house.	7	1
It does sound like the conversation is getting bigger than the two of us.	7	1
There's someone above you and someone below you	7	1
and everybody's buying everybody dinner.	7	1
Wouldn't it be cheaper for Mr. Butler to just walk down the hall?	7	1
SC&P's relationship with Butler Footwear	7	1
is very important to our company.	7	1
And I think you're being shortsighted about our value.	7	1
Well, I was hired to be bold.	7	1
And I'm prepared to make my recommendation.	7	1
Forgive me, but my wife will he excited	7	1
to have me tuck the kids in at least once this week.	7	1
Certainly, I just--	7	1
could you hold off on your recommendation a few days	7	1
so that you can at least have the dinner you thought you were having?	7	1
Sure. Pleasure to meet you.	7	1
You as well.	7	1
Excuse me.	7	1
Could I get a splash of whiskey in this?	7	1
I'll get the bag. You go sit down.	7	1
Take a quick look.	7	1
Then I want to turn off the lights so you can see the view.	7	1
I like what you did with it.	7	1
I love it.	7	1
But my next house is gonna have a pool.	7	1
Our next house.	7	1
Are you sure you don't want to move into a more populated area?	7	1
It's like Dracula's castle up here.	7	1
They're far away, Don.	7	1
It's just what happens to the sound in the canyon.	7	1
I'm scared, but I don't want to turn the lights back on.	7	1
I'm a little dizzy.	7	1
I just-- l need to keep walking just for a second.	7	1
Oh!	7	1
I'm sorry.	7	1
I'll make it up to you tomorrow.	7	1
Get some rest.	7	1
Don, honey.	7	1
Please don't flick any cigarettes off the balcony.	7	1
I don't know how, but everyone says	7	1
they can tell where the fire starts.	7	1
Don?	7	1
I love my scarf.	7	1
I thought with the convertible, you'd need a few.	7	1
It's 9:00 and I have to get to class.	7	1
You want me to drop you at the office?	7	1
No, I'll take a cab.	7	1
Just don't work all day, okay?	7	1
And don't rip the ads out of my magazines.	7	1
Stan, you want coffee?	7	1
What are you doing here?	7	1
I'm just catching up on all the work that's been going on.	7	1
Looks good. Lou, he's--	7	1
Yes, absolutely.	7	1
- So... - I have a lot to do.	7	1
Stan, do you want any coffee?	7	1
- Yes. - What?	7	1
He said yes.	7	1
Stan!	7	1
You don't have to make me any. I'll he out of here in a minute.	7	1
Hey, Ted. Good to see you.	7	1
Hey, Stan.	7	1
I thought you'd be tan.	7	1
Well, you're in an office here, you're in an office there.	7	1
What's the difference?	7	1
You know what?	7	1
I'm just going to get my work and get out of here.	7	1
Good to see you guys.	7	1
None of this seems related to coffee.	7	1
Buck up, chief.	7	1
I'm fine. It's fine.	7	1
You look good.	7	1
You look well, too.	7	1
Iced tea.	7	1
You really branched out into a new environment.	7	1
I did discover it in a homesick moment.	7	1
I flew back New Year's Eve after a week with my brother	7	1
and Christmas with Tammy and my in-laws.	7	1
Sat at the counter by myself	7	1
and immediately felt divine.	7	1
I'll have a Brooklyn Avenue.	7	1
It's a pastrami with the coleslaw right on the sandwich.	7	1
Two of those.	7	1
Believe it or not, Brooklyn Avenue is a street in East Los Angeles.	7	1
The New Yorkers here, they brought as much as we need.	7	1
But the bagels are terrible.	7	1
Where are you living?	7	1
I have an apartment by the tar pits.	7	1
It's one bedroom, but it's two stories.	7	1
Must have quite a view.	7	1
The city is flat and ugly and the air is brown,	7	1
but I love the vibrations.	7	1
You not only dress like a hippie, you talk like one.	7	1
What have you been up to?	7	1
Keeping busy. You sign anything out here?	7	1
Yeah.	7	1
The first week I signed H. Salt Fish and Chips.	7	1
Four stores.	7	1
Didn't Roger make an announcement?	7	1
I wouldn't know.	7	1
Oh, of course.	7	1
Listen, you know if it was up to me, you'd be back there already.	7	1
How's Ted?	7	1
I noticed you timed it so that you'd be out here while he was back there.	7	1
I came to see my wife.	7	1
Yes, of course.	7	1
I've been meaning to look her up.	7	1
It's incredible, but he's sour.	7	1
Maybe he doesn't like the sun.	7	1
Last weekend, middle of January,	7	1
Sunkist sent us out to the groves	7	1
and I picked an orange right off the tree.	7	1
It's 75.	7	1
There's snow on the mountains.	7	1
Ted sat in the car with the door open writing on a pad.	7	1
It's good, isn't it?	7	1
So although Beverly Hills has the patina of show business,	7	1
it's really just accountants, lawyers, and dentists.	7	1
And you can walk to lunch, although I don't.	7	1
Very nice.	7	1
So this is the chamber of horrors.	7	1
And then that's my office.	7	1
Well, wonder who that could be.	7	1
- Hello there. - Bonnie Whiteside.	7	1
This is Don Draper.	7	1
Bonnie's a real estate agent.	7	1
She's helping me find the ideal pad.	7	1
What, and leave the tar pits?	7	1
It's cute, but he shouldn't be renting.	7	1
Those are some nice-looking properties.	7	1
Where are you living?	7	1
I told you, honey, Don's bicoastal.	7	1
I wanted to be by the ocean, but my wife rented a house in the hills.	7	1
- Great view. - City or valley?	7	1
I don't know.	7	1
Well, when you're tired of commuting,	7	1
give me a call.	7	1
Don't get excited, Don.	7	1
She turns it on for everyone.	7	1
Ooh!	7	1
Professor Podolsky?	7	1
Mrs. Harris, I presume?	7	1
I appreciate you meeting me on a Saturday.	7	1
Well, the price is right and the company looks interesting.	7	1
What exactly is the company, by the way?	7	1
The client is in footwear.	7	1
Shoes, women's.	7	1
The new head of marketing wants to cut costs.	7	1
I get it.	7	1
It's 20 degrees out there and the kids are in sandals.	7	1
Lowering overhead is not a bad idea.	7	1
Is that where you'd start,	7	1
"keeping in mind ""the four Ps""?"	7	1
Do you have an MBA?	7	1
No, but their head of marketing does.	7	1
These kids.	7	1
"Believe me, Rockefeller didn't worry about ""the four Ps."""	7	1
Still, I'm going to need an argument	7	1
and I think it's going to need to be more technical than that.	7	1
I mean, if they're not quitters, it makes more sense	7	1
to diversify their lines or open foreign offices.	7	1
How much to get an analysis like that in writing?	7	1
Well, let's see if you have anything to trade.	7	1
This is a business school. Doesn't money work here?	7	1
I'm doing an advertising research study.	7	1
I wanted to know what percentage of your clients	7	1
work on fees versus commission.	7	1
Oh.	7	1
Well, when I started working,	7	1
my goodness-- 16 years ago,	7	1
all of our clients were on commission.	7	1
We started discussing a fee-based model three years ago.	7	1
Now we're at 50-50.	7	1
I don't know if you can answer this,	7	1
or even understand it,	7	1
but what is the difference?	7	1
Actually, I can answer that.	7	1
You're going to need another pad.	7	1
Hello.	7	1
You frying bacon?	7	1
It's in the coq au vin.	7	1
And I made bread pudding with blueberries in it for dessert.	7	1
Any wine left or did the chicken drink it all?	7	1
I picked you up a bottle.	7	1
Better.	7	1
I think you have the wrong address. I don't know--	7	1
Fellas, why don't you put it over there?	7	1
Over where? It's huge.	7	1
By the window. There's a wall. That's where it goes.	7	1
- Thank you very much. - You've got to sign.	7	1
Thank you.	7	1
Why did you do that?	7	1
- You have an antenna on the roof? - It's huge.	7	1
It's the way they make them now.	7	1
How's it gonna look, Don?	7	1
You know, everyone I know here is starving.	7	1
You're going to be on TV.	7	1
Don't you want to watch yourself in living color?	7	1
Don't jinx me.	7	1
I didn't know an expensive gift would upset you.	7	1
You're not here long enough for a fight.	7	1
What are you doing up so late?	7	1
My mama said to tell you the toilet's clogged.	7	1
Well, she's not supposed to flush things down it.	7	1
She'll know what I'm talking about.	7	1
My mama said some people just throw it out the window,	7	1
but she's not gonna.	7	1
You got to fix it.	7	1
I'm sorry, Julio, but l just got home from work.	7	1
It's Saturday. Why you got to work?	7	1
You got to fix it!	7	1
You could ask nicely. That might work better.	7	1
- She said to yell at you. - Why?	7	1
Because you don't listen.	7	1
I don't understand her!	7	1
Here. This is yours. It's a gift. Good night.	7	1
"""Lost Horizon"" score playing on TV"	7	1
What is this?	7	1
Let's go to bed.	7	1
Hey.	7	1
Yes?	7	1
We haven't celebrated.	7	1
Oh, I didn't know if you wanted to.	7	1
I do.	7	1
Let me brush my teeth.	7	1
Hold on.	7	1
Are you okay?	7	1
I'm just--	7	1
I don't know why I feel nervous.	7	1
About this?	7	1
About everything.	7	1
Don't.	7	1
Good morning.	7	1
How much time do we have?	7	1
I'm on the red-eye.	7	1
I hate this.	7	1
We have the rest of the day.	7	1
I know.	7	1
I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.	7	1
Hello.	7	1
They saved all the construction for Sunday.	7	1
It's okay, Daddy. Catch your breath.	7	1
It's so good to see you.	7	1
Sweetheart, being summoned makes me nervous.	7	1
No, everything is wonderful.	7	1
Can you give us a minute?	7	1
To the fear of an ambush.	7	1
To being together.	7	1
What the hell are you up to?	7	1
I just wanted to see you	7	1
and tell you that it's been too long and that...	7	1
well, when all is said and done,	7	1
I forgive you.	7	1
That's beautiful to hear.	7	1
Because I forgive you, too.	7	1
No, Daddy.	7	1
I forgive you.	7	1
And I forgive you.	7	1
All of your transgressions...	7	1
abandoning Mother,	7	1
making me ask for money,	7	1
your intermittent interest in Ellery.	7	1
I don't even care that you smell like incense	7	1
"or have any thoughts about your current, quote, ""state of affairs."""	7	1
I-- I simply forgive you.	7	1
You want me to say I'm sorry?	7	1
Because I don't agree with all that.	7	1
Where the hell is this coming from?	7	1
Well, if you must know, I've been searching.	7	1
And with a little help, I've come to understand	7	1
that anger can be vanquished by love.	7	1
Are you going to church?	7	1
Not in any way you'd understand.	7	1
- What do you want from me? - Nothing.	7	1
You can't make it better.	7	1
So now we're just supposed to eat eggs Benedict?	7	1
I would love that.	7	1
Good evening.	7	1
Evening.	7	1
Thank you.	7	1
Do you want a sleeping pill?	7	1
No, thank you.	7	1
You know what?	7	1
Me either.	7	1
I'm sorry. Don't tell me you enjoy flying.	7	1
I fly a lot.	7	1
And I'm always hoping I was seated next to,	7	1
well, someone like you...	7	1
instead of a man with a hairpiece eating a banana.	7	1
But why would I expect anything else?	7	1
You can blame Madison Avenue for that.	7	1
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.	7	1
Where were you? I was worried.	7	1
I thought we hated all things domestic.	7	1
You sound uptight.	7	1
Man walks in, obviously having tied one on,	7	1
"woman says, ""Where were you?"""	7	1
Kind of establishment.	7	1
Why are you being so mean?	7	1
Move over.	7	1
Oh, Christ. Move him over, too.	7	1
Is that my vest?	7	1
If you were with someone, I don't care.	7	1
You know anyone's welcome in this bed.	7	1
I just want to get some sleep.	7	1
I'd like to put this on, but vanity is preventing me.	7	1
You want me to wear mine so I don't see you?	7	1
This is nice. I usually sleep alone.	7	1
What about the man that gave you that ring?	7	1
He passed away.	7	1
A year ago, actually.	7	1
I was--	7	1
he wanted his ashes scattered at Pebble Beach.	7	1
How was that?	7	1
I failed.	7	1
It's a very popular spot for such things.	7	1
Apparently, they don't want another sand trap.	7	1
I ended up at his second choice.	7	1
Disneyland.	7	1
Really?	7	1
- Have you ever been there? - I have.	7	1
Where is he now?	7	1
Tom Sawyer Island.	7	1
That's probably a popular destination, too.	7	1
Yes, they were very vigilant.	7	1
It took some doing.	7	1
How old was he?	7	1
He would have been 50.	7	1
So, much older?	7	1
He worked fast, too.	7	1
What happened to him?	7	1
He was thirsty.	7	1
He died of thirst.	7	1
His company sent him to a hospital.	7	1
I went with him.	7	1
I was supposed to be part of the cure somehow.	7	1
And all I did was observe.	7	1
I thought he was really getting better.	7	1
Then a doctor told me he'd be dead in a year.	7	1
All of them would be.	7	1
I'm gonna close my eyes now.	7	1
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.	7	1
Despite our best efforts, we're still stacked up,	7	1
but it looks like we're two away.	7	1
I think that we'll begin our descent in 15 minutes.	7	1
Sorry, l think I dozed off.	7	1
You have a few more minutes.	7	1
If I was your wife, I wouldn't like this.	7	1
She knows I'm a terrible husband.	7	1
How long have you been married?	7	1
Not long enough.	7	1
I really thought I could do it this time.	7	1
- Did she kick you out? - No.	7	1
She doesn't know that much, but she knows.	7	1
Well, if she doesn't know, you should just keep it that way.	7	1
That's what people do.	7	1
I keep wondering...	7	1
have I broken the vessel?	7	1
If you did, what can you do about it?	7	1
It's done.	7	1
I bet I could make you feel better.	7	1
I bet you could.	7	1
There's a car waiting for me. I can give you a lift.	7	1
I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.	7	1
Your tenant Mrs. Rodriguez called again about her toilet.	7	1
She was hard to understand, but I think she said	7	1
she's calling the alderman.	7	1
Ugh.	7	1
Call my sister Anita and tell her to get Gerry	7	1
and his friend the plumber up there.	7	1
- Shouldn't I just call Gerry? - No.	7	1
Anita can ask her husband, I can't.	7	1
- Good morning, ladies. - Good morning.	7	1
- How was your weekend? - Peachy. Cut up some firewood.	7	1
I'm sorry about last week.	7	1
You're right that I shouldn't have suggested something I didn't like.	7	1
I never gave it another thought.	7	1
Well, I did and I realized that Freddy's original idea	7	1
was the best, but I didn't do it justice.	7	1
What are you doing? I already said yes.	7	1
“Accutron,	7	1
"it's not a timepiece, it's a conversation piece."""	7	1
Forget it.	7	1
- Morning. - Morning, Lou.	7	1
This is actually a big idea.	7	1
Why are you making this so hard?	7	1
Open the door and walk in.	7	1
You do not need to parachute in through the ceiling.	7	1
But I don't mind. l just want to give you my best.	7	1
I don't know, Peggy-	7	1
I guess I'm immune to your charms.	7	1
Can I get some coffee?	7	1
Good morning, Clara. ls Ken in yet?	7	1
No, he's on the plane.	7	1
As soon as he lands, I need to speak with him regarding Butler.	7	1
Good for you. Mr. Butler is coming in this week.	7	1
What?	7	1
Get Wayne Barnes on the line-- now.	7	1
Mr. Barnes on line three.	7	1
Joan?	7	1
- You already set a meeting? - Good morning.	7	1
I took you seriously, but you didn't take me seriously.	7	1
Look, I know you're fighting for your job, but don't get emotional.	7	1
I'm fighting for your job.	7	1
Okay, well, I appreciate it, but don't worry about me.	7	1
- I'll be fine. - Are you sure?	7	1
Let's talk about your in-house advertising agency.	7	1
You think you can go into a network or a newspaper	7	1
with your checkbook and get the space we get	7	1
when we deal with them every day with 30 clients?	7	1
You will be competing against us,	7	1
not against other shoe companies.	7	1
We both know the shoe business is going to decline	7	1
for some time in the future.	7	1
If you make a bold move now,	7	1
that decline will be your responsibility.	7	1
What are you gonna do then?	7	1
You can only fire us once.	7	1
So what am I supposed to do?	7	1
I already set the meeting.	7	1
Cancel it.	7	1
No, I'm asking you,	7	1
what do I do?	7	1
Tell them we cancelled the meeting.	7	1
We need more time to present a revised media strategy.	7	1
- Yes. - Good.	7	1
I'm still expecting to meet with Ken.	7	1
I'll follow up on that today.	7	1
You'd better.	7	1
Did you tell him to prepare more boards for Accutron?	7	1
- Do you want to do it? - No, I want to do it.	7	1
- I don't know what I did. - Get out of here.	7	1
He may be in the art department, but he reports to me.	7	1
"We already have boards for ""Accutron is accurate."""	7	1
You know that's a loser.	7	1
I think if he could see both of them, he'll change his mind.	7	1
Or at least let us show both to the client.	7	1
Let it go, baby. It's dead.	7	1
No, l just don't think he's given it the proper thought.	7	1
You're telling your boss you think he's stupid.	7	1
Well, I'm tired of fighting for everything to be better.	7	1
You're all a bunch of hacks who are perfectly happy with shit.	7	1
Nobody cares about anything.	7	1
No one wants things to be better, I got it.	7	1
I'll just stand out here all by myself.	7	1
We find ourselves rich in goods, but ragged in spirit--	7	1
reaching with magnificent precision for the moon,	7	1
but falling into raucous discord on Earth.	7	1
We are caught in war wanting peace.	7	1
We're torn by division wanting unity.	7	1
We see around us empty lives wanting fulfillment.	7	1
We see tasks that need doing...	7	1
- Come in. - ...waiting for hands to do them.	7	1
You know I'm breaking a rule here.	7	1
I haven't had one of these sausages since I quit.	7	1
If this makes me have dreams about beer,	7	1
I'm gonna be mad at you.	7	1
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.	7	1
I should be paying you.	7	1
You want that balcony door open? It's freezing outside.	7	1
Peggy went bananas for your Accutron work.	7	1
Of course she lifted her leg on it.	7	1
Also, I swang by J. Walter Thompson,	7	1
thinking there was an emergency with our copy for 7-Up.	7	1
- You want a sweater? - Nah.	7	1
Turns out they're looking for help on Oscar Mayer.	7	1
You are making quite a name for me out there.	7	1
Bologna? Hot dogs? It's moms and kids either way.	7	1
Why don't you stop this Cyrano bit	7	1
and march your ass in there and get us both a job?	7	1
Because I have a job.	7	1
It's been two months.	7	1
Nobody's called, right?	7	1
I'm still being paid.	7	1
Well, they had Christmas without you.	7	1
The Super Bowl. Pretty soon it's gonna be Easter.	7	1
You know, I've been there.	7	1
You don't want to be damaged goods.	7	1
I tried to get a hold of you.	7	1
Why? I spoke to Clara. Thank you for solving that problem.	7	1
I bailed it out, but I think it's irreparable.	7	1
It's only a matter of time before we lose it.	7	1
Every account man who's ever come into my office has said that.	7	1
But they haven't all left one of these.	7	1
- Oh. - Stay out of my office.	7	1
Sorry.	7	1
I dozed off.	7	1
Well, Jimmy says he'll be back in the morning.	7	1
He needed a part.	7	1
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.	7	1
It seems silly for you to go all the way out to Brooklyn and come back.	7	1
It won't take long this time of night.	7	1
Are you sure?	7	1
I don't like Anita there alone in the house.	7	1
Of course.	7	1
- See you in the morning. - Okay.	7	1

- Evening, Mr. Draper. - Hello, Dawn.	7	2
 - Let me take your coat. - It's 8:00. Do you mind?	7	2
What is this?	7	2
Sweet'N Low and Coffee-Mate. I noticed you were out.	7	2
Is this an elaborate plea for coffee? I can make some.	7	2
I really can't stay.	7	2
Mrs. Draper did not call this morning,	7	2
but I arranged for a Valentine bouquet to arrive	7	2
in the afternoon her time, so I'd expect a call here around dinner.	7	2
Good girl.	7	2
Mohawk Airlines? Henry Lammott came in?	7	2
He just dropped in. He wanted to meet Lou.	7	2
Huh. Office or conference room?	7	2
- Conference room. - Where did he sit?	7	2
- Who? - Lou.	7	2
 I don't remember.	7	2
How did Diners Club go on Tuesday?	7	2
It got pushed back for a signing meeting with Handi-Wrap.	7	2
More Dow? How long has that been going on?	7	2
I don't know. It's Mr. Cosgrove.	7	2
Clara's terrible with memos.	7	2
- What creative team is on it? - I don't know.	7	2
- No other calls? - No, Mr. Draper.	7	2
I know, I know. I told you, it's for carfare.	7	2
Well, I've been thinking about it a lot, actually.	7	2
And you know I don't mind keeping you aware of things.	7	2
But there's something about the money that makes it feel wrong.	7	2
You're doing extra work. You should get extra pay.	7	2
It's no work at all.	7	2
So I will continue to do what I feel comfortable doing for free,	7	2
which is answer your phone and keep you up to date.	7	2
That's all I ask for.	7	2
No, you asked me to get you photocopies of the Butler work	7	2
and they're locked in Peggy's office and I can't.	7	2
I don't want you to do that.	7	2
All right. Good.	7	2
But I want you to take this.	7	2
- You take care. - Of course.	7	2
The cleaning woman comes tomorrow morning.	7	2

"Carol: She says, ""You look like a working girl."""	7	2
And I thought she meant I looked low-class like a secretary.	7	2
But Petra said she meant a prostitute.	7	2
How the fuck does my mother know what a prostitute looks like?	7	2
How was Sarah?	7	2
Below average.	7	2
She wants me to bring her Capezios,	7	2
so I don't know what I'm going to wear.	7	2
Is it an open casket?	7	2
I didn't ask.	7	2
Sergeant Snorkel says we have to come back on the 12:30.	7	2
So back here by 3:00?	7	2
The funeral's at 9:00.	7	2
We see Sarah, boo-hoo.	7	2
Maybe we leave a little early because Sally's so upset.	7	2
We get in a taxi to the cemetery,	7	2
but we get out in Greenwich Village.	7	2
Two hours of shopping, take another pumpkin to Grand Central.	7	2
There's a boutique on MacDougal that has Pocahontas boots.	7	2
I am upset, Carol.	7	2
Me, too. I heard her dad's a mess.	7	2
She was supposed to be a great beauty.	7	2
Sarah had this picture of her wearing a bikini on Christmas.	7	2
She took it with her.	7	2
You know she's gonna miss school till Easter?	7	2
I wish my mom was dead.	7	2
I'd stay here till 1975 if I could get Betty in the ground.	7	2
What are you wearing?	7	2
I don't have anything black but my turtleneck,	7	2
so I thought I'd wear that with my brown suede skirt and black tights.	7	2
Jesus, Draper. ls this your first funeral?	7	2
(laughing)	7	2
Leave the lights off.	7	2
How am I gonna find anything?	7	2
Why do you have to do this tonight?	7	2
- Hey. - Didn't you already sign Chevy?	7	2
Can't you just add the business onto their other contract?	7	2
Sweetheart, let me explain this to you.	7	2
This is the Southern California Chevrolet Dealers Association.	7	2
Chevy's the factory, this is the store.	7	2
You're not listening to me.	7	2
Just has to be there when he wakes up.	7	2
He's so drunk, he doesn't even know where he is.	7	2
That's why it has to be there when he wakes up	7	2
with a note that says,	7	2
"""You promised to sign this no matter what."""	7	2
( moans )	7	2
You are such a big deal.	7	2
( Door opens )	7	2
How'd it go?	7	2
- I got 'em. - Good work.	7	2
- Good night, Bonnie. - Good night.	7	2
- ( Door closes ) - ( both laughing )	7	2
( elevator bell dings )	7	2
Peggy: Hold that, please.	7	2
- Hello, New York. - Howdy.	7	2
Oh, Michael, very nice work on Butler.	7	2
Stan, we're going to need renderings, color.	7	2
( Elevator bell dings )	7	2
- How's Monday? - Today is Friday.	7	2
Whew, I'm buried all day and I have plans tonight.	7	2
So you can finish tonight and have plans all weekend.	7	2
- She's gonna find out. - What?	7	2
( Sighs )	7	2
Maybe if you invite me, you can have till Tuesday.	7	2
We now all know you don't have plans for Valentine's Day.	7	2
Oh.	7	2
She has plans. Look at her calendar.	7	2
"""February 14, masturbate gloomily."""	7	2
- ( elevator bell dings ) - Monday is fine.	7	2
Who are these from?	7	2
Hard to believe your cat has the money.	7	2
Really lovely.	7	2
Look at you, every inch a girl.	7	2
Is this some kind of joke?	7	2
Just tell me now because I don't want to have to fire you later.	7	2
Enjoy your flowers, boss.	7	2
Oh.	7	2
Happy Valentine's Day, Shirley.	7	2
And happy Valentine's Day to you.	7	2
Shirley, I see there's no card,	7	2
but I'd like to know who sent me these beautiful flowers.	7	2
Well, actually--	7	2
Oh.	7	2
Oh.	7	2
I understand now.	7	2
Oh, good.	7	2
Could you get me some coffee?	7	2
What time is it on the coast?	7	2
- Pardon? - 6:00 a.m.	7	2
I'll handle it.	7	2
Could you get the door?	7	2
( Phone rings )	7	2
Ted Chaough's office.	7	2
Good morning, Moira. It's Peggy.	7	2
Where are you?	7	2
I'm in my office, but I need you to relay a message to Ted for me.	7	2
Oh, okay.	7	2
Tell him that I got his message.	7	2
No, tell him that I relayed his message	7	2
to the client and...	7	2
And what?	7	2
There's nothing he can do.	7	2
They're not--	7	2
they don't want to hear any more pitches.	7	2
The business is gone.	7	2
Really? What account?	7	2
He'll know.	7	2
Well, the snow's melted, but not the hearts of New Yorkers.	7	2
"I just had some old lady call me a ""kike."""	7	2
- ls that right? - Yeah.	7	2
She was letting her dog relieve himself	7	2
"and I said, ""Pardon me, but you want to curb that thing?"""	7	2
"She says, ""Mind your own business, kike."""	7	2
( laughs ) Maybe it's the hat.	7	2
The strangest things happen to you.	7	2
Hey, did you see this?	7	2
Ogilvy signed Hershey.	7	2
I hadn't heard that.	7	2
( Man speaking on P.A. )	7	2
She hates her because she got a C in Western Civ.	7	2
She corrects my English.	7	2
I went to school in England.	7	2
Are we going to walk into school with these?	7	2
We'll say they're Sarah's.	7	2
Is my purse in your bag?	7	2
The senior class sent her flowers because they're all so concerned.	7	2
Half of them think her name is Sally.	7	2
Shit, I must have left it at the coffee shop.	7	2
Maybe in the head shop?	7	2
I'm just going to go up and check at the counter.	7	2
- I'll get your fare. - No, my address book is in there.	7	2
- It's everybody I know. - We can't wait.	7	2
There's another train in a couple hours.	7	2
"- ""Hello, Dawn."" - ""Hello, Shirley."""	7	2
You shouldn't be taking a break right where you are.	7	2
I'm not. I'm getting her coffee. And I'm taking my time.	7	2
- ( Chuckles ) What did she do now? - It ain't funny.	7	2
Charles sent me 12 long-stem roses in a crystal vase	7	2
and she took 'em.	7	2
I was right at the photocopier when she came in	7	2
preparing her shit, and somehow--	7	2
'cause I put the card in my purse,	7	2
"I guess because it said, ""I love you so""--"	7	2
she thought they were hers.	7	2
Well, it was an honest mistake.	7	2
Who the hell is sending her flowers?	7	2
(laughs)	7	2
Why didn't you say something?	7	2
It was too late. I tried.	7	2
- You tried? - I really did.	7	2
Well, they're hers now.	7	2
I'm gonna tell her.	7	2
You want those flowers so bad,	7	2
you'll take the trouble that comes with getting them back?	7	2
It's not right.	7	2
Well, I have two bosses	7	2
and one of them hasn't told his wife he's on leave.	7	2
Keep pretending.	7	2
That's your job.	7	2
Well, you know who I feel the worst for is Charles.	7	2
He'd rather you have a job.	7	2
You know that's not true.	7	2
"""Happy Valentine's, Dawn."""	7	2
"""Good-bye, Shirley."""	7	2
Dave: You look good. Rested.	7	2
You said that. How do I usually look?	7	2
It's just that you've been so busy for the last two years,	7	2
you've never taken me up for lunch.	7	2
I figured you're on some kind of break.	7	2
Maybe I'm doing research.	7	2
Maybe I want our place to be a little bit more like Wells Rich Greene.	7	2
You'd have to have Mary.	7	2
And, you know, you probably could.	7	2
I knew you were gonna tell me how great it is to work there,	7	2
but I didn't think that's where you'd start.	7	2
So you looking to make a change?	7	2
I have a job.	7	2
And I have a contract and a noncompete clause.	7	2
And I'm a partner.	7	2
Look, I don't know what the truth is and I don't really care.	7	2
Someone said you were dabbling in the LA office	7	2
or managing your wife's career.	7	2
People say things.	7	2
Well, then you probably heard the one	7	2
where you pulled a major boner in a meeting	7	2
and you cried or punched somebody or something	7	2
and that they cut you loose.	7	2
I didn't know I was gonna be interrogated	7	2
by the Hooterville telephone operator.	7	2
So it's not true?	7	2
You're spoiling the mood.	7	2
( Chuckles )	7	2
How about for a second date, we go see the Knicks?	7	2
Right on the floor.	7	2
Bradley's having one hell of a season.	7	2
That's a good idea.	7	2
Hello?	7	2
Can I help you, sweetheart?	7	2
Who are you?	7	2
I'm Mr. Avery. You looking for casting?	7	2
No, I'm looking for my dad, Donald Draper.	7	2
Uh, well, he's not here.	7	2
Did he change offices?	7	2
Perfect.	7	2
Look, honey, he's not here.	7	2
He's probably at home. You should call him.	7	2
You know how to get an outside line?	7	2
Is Joan here?	7	2
That's a good idea. Her office is right down there.	7	2
You know, I think everybody's at lunch.	7	2
( slams )	7	2
Have a nice day.	7	2
So she's sitting there on the conference table	7	2
Indian-style in a dress and boots	7	2
like some kind of perverted kindergarten teacher	7	2
"and she says, ""Well, thank you, Robert."	7	2
"I know it's the best you can do."""	7	2
What did Bob do?	7	2
Accepted his death gracefully.	7	2
I see a sheep and a wolf.	7	2
But which is which?	7	2
- How are you, Don? - Great.	7	2
Jim Hobart, Dave Wooster.	7	2
We know each other.	7	2
So, Dave, how come you'll have lunch with Don and not with me?	7	2
'Cause this is social. He's not trying to buy us.	7	2
Well, what are you trying to do, Don?	7	2
Are you taking lunches now?	7	2
No, I'm just looking for love.	7	2
Well, on behalf of myself	7	2
and all the millionaires at McCann Erickson,	7	2
we'd love a chance to tell you how handsome you are.	7	2
Move along, Jim.	7	2
Tell Mary I picked up the check, because I just did.	7	2
I don't have to crap on McCann for you, do I?	7	2
I almost worked there. Twice.	7	2
But you didn't.	7	2
Here, I want you to have these.	7	2
It smells like an Italian funeral in there.	7	2
( Keys clicking )	7	2
So then dessert finally arrives and the ladies,	7	2
on cue, depart to the toilets.	7	2
And as we're standing, Honeywell leans in and says,	7	2
"""I like what I see."""	7	2
Now, I thought he was making a ribald comment about my date,	7	2
but he followed up by suggesting	7	2
we retire to the bar, just the two of us.	7	2
Is this a partners' meeting	7	2
or the most tedious wireless program I've ever heard?	7	2
- ( Chuckles ) - Pete: What?	7	2
What did he say?	7	2
- We're on the edge of our seats. -( laughing )	7	2
- Hello, New York? - He's saying get to it, Pete.	7	2
- Did you kiss the man or not? - Fine.	7	2
Well, he didn't want to say it in front of the boys from Detroit,	7	2
but he wants us to handle his business.	7	2
He rules the SoCal dealerships with an iron fist.	7	2
- That's great. - Wonderful.	7	2
- That's wonderful news. - It is, isn't it?	7	2
They want us to start on the summer sale.	7	2
Sign them right away.	7	2
Sit in his yard with a pen if you have to.	7	2
Pete: Contract came with the milkman.	7	2
I'll get Bob Benson to fly in from Detroit for the signing.	7	2
We don't want the tail wagging the dog.	7	2
They're the Dealers Association.	7	2
They bill almost as much as Chevy does.	7	2
They are the dog.	7	2
- He's right. - Just a minute.	7	2
Chevy's our client and they're our entree to GM,	7	2
which bills more than everything on the planet.	7	2
I would tell Detroit we've got this opportunity	7	2
and I would ask for their blessing.	7	2
Look, when I brought in Chevy,	7	2
I got their very own Mikey O'Brien laid.	7	2
Sorry, sweetheart. And it wasn't easy. Sorry again.	7	2
Pete caught him. Let Pete mount him.	7	2
Can we move on?	7	2
This phone call is already eating into our fee.	7	2
Ted, weren't you there when we signed Chevy?	7	2
Roger seems to have failed to get a head count.	7	2
I don't see any reason to keep score.	7	2
Gentlemen, this is good news.	7	2
And I have no problem with flying to Detroit	7	2
and briefing Bob and all those--	7	2
I'll bring oranges.	7	2
- Ted? Are you there? - ( static hissing )	7	2
Hello, California?	7	2
- Dee, can you hear us? - Yes, I can.	7	2
- Dee? - ( sighs )	7	2
What's wrong with you? I say up, you say down.	7	2
I'm surprised you're disagreeing with me.	7	2
It's common sense.	7	2
I think they can't hear us.	7	2
We can hear you!	7	2
Pete can service the account,	7	2
but he will report to our man in Detroit	7	2
where said parties will be offered	7	2
the right of refusal.	7	2
I remember very clearly when Don and I signed Chevy.	7	2
Don who?	7	2
Our collective ex-wife who still receives alimony?	7	2
- Hang up. - Pete: No.	7	2
Roger: This is a partners' meeting.	7	2
Let's poll the partners, shall we?	7	2
- Aye. - Aye what?	7	2
I agree with Jim.	7	2
Moira, fix the phone.	7	2
I feel caught off guard by having a confrontation	7	2
over something that seems rudimentary.	7	2
( Phone clicks )	7	2
They never said which of Peggy's accounts we lost.	7	2
Call me when you fix the damn phone.	7	2
Let me try out there.	7	2
What difference could that possibly make?	7	2
I thought we were gonna get a new one of these.	7	2
And why the hell aren't we in the conference room?	7	2
Do not go after him.	7	2
Moira, you can reach me in my office.	7	2
( TV playing )	7	2
Hello?	7	2
- ( TV turns off ) - Marta?	7	2
Oh, I looked everywhere for you.	7	2
What are you doing here?	7	2
What happened? ls everything okay?	7	2
Obviously not.	7	2
- Where were you? - I was at the office.	7	2
What?	7	2
I wasn't feeling well. I left early.	7	2
What happened?	7	2
Does your mother know where you are?	7	2
What? No.	7	2
You're not supposed to be off campus.	7	2
My roommate's mother died and they let us go to the funeral,	7	2
but I lost my purse.	7	2
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.	7	2
I just need money for the train.	7	2
And I guess I need a note of excuse.	7	2
I'll drive you.	7	2
No, it's okay. You're not feeling well.	7	2
I'll be fine.	7	2
You really don't have to.	7	2
It looks like you have a lot of work to do.	7	2
Come on, it'll be nice. We'll take a drive.	7	2
What's the note supposed to say?	7	2
What?	7	2
Sally, what do I say?	7	2
Just tell the truth.	7	2
Where the hell were you?	7	2
I was getting your perfume.	7	2
- Draper's daughter showed up. - Sally was here?	7	2
I don't know her name. She was looking for him.	7	2
My Lord. What did you say?	7	2
I said he's probably at home. It's not my problem.	7	2
I have to call him.	7	2
Call him?	7	2
You have to call him? Okay.	7	2
Don't bother apologizing to me, I guess.	7	2
- I'm very sorry. - ( slams )	7	2
Want to go before we go?	7	2
- ( Phone rings ) - I'm fine.	7	2
- Hello. - It's Dawn.	7	2
And I'm really sorry.	7	2
I don't know what happened,	7	2
but Sally came into the office and she talked to Lou.	7	2
- And what did he say? - I don't know.	7	2
But I wanted you to know that she might be on her way.	7	2
Okay. Thank you, Dawn.	7	2
Do you have to stay?	7	2
No.	7	2
Let's go.	7	2
Hello, Dawn.	7	2
Lou said he wanted to see me.	7	2
- Oh. - ( button clicks )	7	2
Lou, Joan's here to see you.	7	2
Lou: Actually, I need to see the both of you.	7	2
Get the door.	7	2
When I generously agreed	7	2
to share Dawn here with Don Draper,	7	2
it was for the purposes of his correspondence	7	2
and incoming phone calls, not cleaning up his messes.	7	2
One of those things is very time-consuming.	7	2
- What happened? - His daughter came by.	7	2
Why are we going through all this?	7	2
I know you can't fire her.	7	2
Just move her to another part of the building.	7	2
Lou, I will take care of this.	7	2
- What do you mean by that? - I want my own girl.	7	2
- Come along, Dawn. - In a minute.	7	2
Obviously I can say anything I want.	7	2
But you don't want to.	7	2
I skipped my lunch to buy your wife perfume.	7	2
If you had been thoughtful enough to get her a gift	7	2
when I told you about it 10 days ago, I would have been here.	7	2
Do you understand? It's not my problem.	7	2
None of this has anything to do with me.	7	2
I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing.	7	2
Was that necessary?	7	2
When she comes back from the ladies',	7	2
have her hand over the keys.	7	2
New York is on the line.	7	2
Do you have to put them on the contraption?	7	2
It's just Mr. Sterling.	7	2
- This is Pete. - It's Roger.	7	2
I appreciate you fighting for me.	7	2
Well, Jim pled his case	7	2
and we decided it's best to keep the business,	7	2
but run it past Detroit.	7	2
- Which means Bob gets involved. - What?	7	2
Jim and I had a meaningful conversation--	7	2
I heard your conversation. You're full of it.	7	2
That is just the kind of weakness	7	2
that got us in this position to begin with.	7	2
Let me just go to Detroit. I'm sure--	7	2
...something to do with Bob or my feelings towards Bob,	7	2
but it really doesn't.	7	2
It's a chance for me to rectify my status with those people.	7	2
And in the end, that's our best route to new business.	7	2
Dee: He disconnected.	7	2
- ( Sighs ) - ( bangs )	7	2
Why even bring in an account?	7	2
They're just gonna take it away.	7	2
Sometimes I think maybe I died	7	2
and I'm in some kind of...	7	2
I don't know if it's heaven or hell or limbo.	7	2
But I don't seem to exist.	7	2
No one feels my existence.	7	2
Just cash the checks. You're gonna die one day.	7	2
What you're supposed to say is,	7	2
"""Hey, why don't we just start our own agency?"""	7	2
At least the goal would be clear.	7	2
I mean, what am I working for here?	7	2
There's two offices.	7	2
Yours is only slightly better than mine.	7	2
What am I supposed to do, work my way up to your office?	7	2
You can have my office.	7	2
No, that is not the point.	7	2
Cutler sent you out here because you're too moral.	7	2
He couldn't look you in the face and be Machiavelli.	7	2
That's not why I'm here.	7	2
Why are you here?	7	2
All you do is answer the phone and mope around.	7	2
You know what?	7	2
We're not talking anymore.	7	2
From now on, we'll both pretend I'm in New York.	7	2
( Door slams )	7	2
Joan wants us to switch desks.	7	2
Don't feel bad. It's not your fault.	7	2
I know.	7	2
Don't be sore, but I'm really happy.	7	2
I need a box.	7	2
She wants you out front right now.	7	2
Okay. Well, just a few things.	7	2
He takes it light with two Sweet'N Lows.	7	2
Always put through his son Earl.	7	2
These three lines are Lou's	7	2
and this one is Mr. Draper's.	7	2
Maybe I should get a pencil.	7	2
You know what?	7	2
I'll have Mr. Draper's calls come straight to me at reception.	7	2

I could have lived for months on that commission.	7	2
And then it was all gone	7	2
because some asshole barreling down Lake Avenue	7	2
threw his cigarette out the window.	7	2
I'm sorry, but it's not the same.	7	2
It's worse. I'm in sales, too.	7	2
Not some housewife complaining about getting oatmeal out of a carpet.	7	2
An act of God, Pete,	7	2
that's how you know when things are really against you.	7	2
You don't seem very upset about it.	7	2
'Cause that's the thrill.	7	2
Our fortunes are in other people's hands	7	2
and we have to take them.	7	2
( Doorbell rings )	7	2

♪ Carved on a tree... ♪	7	2
You sure you don't want anything?	7	2
I told you, I'm not hungry.	7	2
How are your studies?	7	2
Spectacular.	7	2
Do you want a French fry?	7	2
They're cold.	7	2
Know what? I'm gonna get some coffee.	7	2
I should probably call my friends.	7	2
They're probably worried.	7	2
Want ice cream or something?	7	2
Did you even need gas?	7	2
I wanted to talk to you.	7	2
The reason I didn't tell you I wasn't working	7	2
was because I didn't want anyone to know.	7	2
Got it.	7	2
I didn't behave well.	7	2
I said the wrong things to the wrong people	7	2
at the wrong time.	7	2
What did you say?	7	2
I told the truth about myself.	7	2
But it wasn't the right time... then.	7	2
So they made me take some time off and...	7	2
I was ashamed.	7	2
What was the truth?	7	2
Nothing you don't know.	7	2
So what are you gonna do?	7	2
I don't know.	7	2
It's kind of up to them.	7	2
If you're not going to work, why don't you stay with Megan?	7	2
Because I wanted to be here to fix it.	7	2
- How? - ( chuckles )	7	2
I don't know.	7	2
Do you still love Megan?	7	2
Of course I do.	7	2
You know I visit every couple weeks.	7	2
I talk to her all the time.	7	2
Why don't you just tell her that you don't want to move to California?	7	2
Go ahead.	7	2
- Can I get a Coke? - Sure.	7	2
( Phone ringing )	7	2
- I'm sorry to bother you. - What do you want, Peggy?	7	2
( Sighs ) Well, I'd like Shirley off my desk.	7	2
What? What did she do?	7	2
There was an incident today	7	2
and I'm not comfortable with her on my desk.	7	2
I shouldn't have to tell you more than that.	7	2
- So just fire her. - I didn't say that.	7	2
She can work anywhere in the office you want.	7	2
I just want someone else.	7	2
Fine.	7	2
- You can share Moira. - She hates me.	7	2
- Meredith. - She has the mind of a child.	7	2
Damn it, Peggy!	7	2
Dawn can't work with Lou.	7	2
Neither of them can work out front.	7	2
Scarlett and Harry are practically married.	7	2
- What do you want me to do? - Fix it!	7	2
All I know is that today was a workday	7	2
and I didn't get anything done.	7	2
( Knocks )	7	2
- What do you want?! - I'm sorry.	7	2
Since the meeting was aborted,	7	2
I wanted to get some details regarding Avon.	7	2
But perhaps now is not a good time.	7	2
We're just having some personnel issues.	7	2
I just realized	7	2
you have two jobs, don't you?	7	2
- I'm not complaining. - Maybe you should.	7	2
What are the skills required down here?	7	2
Organization? Fortitude?	7	2
Lack of concern for being unliked?	7	2
( Chuckles ) I suppose.	7	2
Well...	7	2
there's an office open upstairs.	7	2
It's for an account man, not the head of personnel.	7	2
What do you mean?	7	2
Let me know what you decide.	7	2
We can talk about Avon on Monday.	7	2
Good night.	7	2
- Carol: Hello? - It's me.	7	2
Where the hell are you?	7	2
We've got you covered till lights out.	7	2
Ankle Fat thinks you're at a church somewhere	7	2
with Sarah crying on your shoulder.	7	2
Thanks, but I'm with my dad.	7	2
He wrote me a note.	7	2
You're never going to believe what happened on the train.	7	2
There was this creepy salesman from Milford.	7	2
He's really old, but he keeps smiling at us	7	2
and he wants to take us to the smoker.	7	2
- Yolanda said-- - You know what, Carol?	7	2
- I should go. - Well, we hid your booty.	7	2
Your sandals, they're in the back of the closet next to your cleats.	7	2
So at least the trip was worth it.	7	2
I'll see you later. Bye.	7	2
What's this?	7	2
I sot you a patty melt.	7	2
Everything okay?	7	2
Mm-hmm.	7	2
I don't like you going to funerals.	7	2
It was awful.	7	2
Sarah's mom was yellow.	7	2
She was wearing this wig.	7	2
I hate that you had to see that.	7	2
I only went so I could go shopping.	7	2
I doubt that.	7	2
I don't know.	7	2
Life goes on.	7	2
I'm so many people.	7	2
Can you see the car from here?	7	2
Yes.	7	2
Good.	7	2
I want you to finish your meal.	7	2
I'm gonna go out to the car and get it running.	7	2
Then you walk out.	7	2
We're not gonna pay.	7	2
Really?	7	2
Don't bother with the flowers. Everyone's gone.	7	2
No, these are mine.	7	2
They're from my son. Thank you, Roger.	7	2
Well, I bet he's gonna be pretty upset if he sees you giving them away.	7	2
I'm not.	7	2
I'm taking them to my new office.	7	2
Up here?	7	2
It was suggested that I move now that I have some accounts.	7	2
Jim suggested it?	7	2
Do you disagree?	7	2
Does it matter?	7	2
Well, Rome wasn't built in a day.	7	2
( Phone ringing )	7	2
Ah, hello.	7	2
Hello.	7	2
Apparently we're going to finish that conference call on Monday.	7	2
That won't be necessary.	7	2
I set Pete straight.	7	2
Hmm, glad to hear it.	7	2
I'd hate to think of you as an adversary.	7	2
I'd really hate that.	7	2
You sure I don't have to go in and talk to anyone?	7	2
No, I have the note.	7	2

Dawn Chambers, please.	7	3
( Phone rings)	7	3
- Dawn Chambers. - I'm glad I caught you.	7	3
I need ribbon for my typewriter.	7	3
It's a Coronet.	7	3
And I have letterhead, but I could use a ream of onionskin.	7	3
Okay.	7	3
 And I wrote a letter to Fritz over at Leica.	7	3
I'm going to need an airmail envelope.	7	3
I can get these sent over to you right now.	7	3
- Just bring them with you. - Mr. Draper, I'm swamped.	7	3
I have to get a schedule out for a shoot.	7	3
So you can come a little later. What are you shooting?	7	3
- Mountain Dew. - Oh.	7	3
What is it?	7	3
"Um, it's called ""Invisible Boy."""	7	3
It's this kid--	7	3
Ginsberg finally got that through.	7	3
I guess so.	7	3
Anyway, Mr. Draper, I can get a messenger to you in 20 minutes,	7	3
unless you're going out.	7	3
 Obviously I didn't make any plans.	7	3
I was expecting you to come over.	7	3
Were there any calls?	7	3
- ( Phone ringing) - Just Mr. Alan Silver	7	3
from the Paul Kohner Agency in Los Angeles.	7	3
Can you get him on the line?	7	3
I'm sorry, my phone is ringing off the hook.	7	3
I hope it's okay. He says you have his number.	7	3
Or I can give it to you again.	7	3
No, Dawn, I want you to call him.	7	3
I, uh-- can you hold?	7	3
Don Draper for Alan Silver.	7	3
Don. Glad I caught you.	7	3
I was beginning to give up hope.	7	3
How can I help you?	7	3
It's a bit of a casting issue.	7	3
I don't know if I can help you with that.	7	3
Well, it has to do with our girl.	7	3
And I'm probably overreacting,	7	3
but you're the closest thing to a manager	7	3
and, let's face it, you probably have more influence.	7	3
( laughs ) You better.	7	3
Just get to it, Alan.	7	3
Megan went into an audition	7	3
and performed adequately from what I can tell	7	3
and by the time she got to the parking lot	7	3
decided to call casting	7	3
and ask if she could come back in and do it differently.	7	3
So she's persistent.	7	3
On Sunday she got the director's number	7	3
from someone in her acting class, called his home,	7	3
then managed to run into him at the Brentwood Country Mart	7	3
while he was having lunch with Rod Serling.	7	3
She met Rod Serling?	7	3
I don't even know if she knew he was there.	7	3
She apparently pled her case in tears	7	3
and demanded another reading.	7	3
Why would she do that?	7	3
It's not like I've never seen this before.	7	3
They lose their confidence.	7	3
But I don't want anyone to have that anecdote.	7	3
It's best we nip this in the bud.	7	3
Well, what am I supposed to do?	7	3
You know her better than I do.	7	3
I tried to talk to her, but she hung up.	7	3
You have to tell her to relax.	7	3
She really is doing well as the new girl in town.	7	3
Yeah.	7	3
Well, then, I don't want to take up any more of your precious time.	7	3
Yeah, thank you.	7	3
- ( Phone ringing) - ( approaching footsteps )	7	3
It's the Clios. Who cares?	7	3
I do, but you shouldn't give them the power	7	3
to decide who shall live and who shall die.	7	3
Stan and I are part of the agency and Playtex is our client.	7	3
We'd feel the same if it was the other way around.	7	3
Would you describe that as patronizing?	7	3
I'm not taking anything away from anybody.	7	3
But I'm not going to do better work than St. Joseph's.	7	3
Lou's finishing his call.	7	3
You'll get 'em next year.	7	3
I gave that account to you when I left.	7	3
I worked Playtex for years.	7	3
Well, maybe you didn't work it right.	7	3
Lou: Send in the cavalry.	7	3
Morning.	7	3
Mr. Draper, good morning.	7	3
A weekday? What a treat.	7	3
Nice to see you, Tricia.	7	3
No briefcase?	7	3
I'm going to surprise my wife.	7	3
I've said it before-- I hate her.	7	3
What can I get you?	7	3
Tomato juice.	7	3
Freeze-frame as our stallion runs through the background.	7	3
The bottle appears.	7	3
"Announcer-- ""Chevalier Noir."	7	3
"More horsepower."""	7	3
Why is there artwork?	7	3
Well, I believe it really helps if you see it.	7	3
You understand every hour he works costs money?	7	3
You can't be hypothetical.	7	3
- It took a second, Lou. - Stay out of it, Rizzo.	7	3
It's already done. Would you just look at it?	7	3
Who put a knot in your pantyhose?	7	3
She's upset because I got nominated for a Clio	7	3
"and ""Rosemary's Baby"" didn't."	7	3
I don't care about awards.	7	3
Oh, sorry, Peggy.	7	3
Jim pulled it because St. Joseph's	7	3
was still unhappy about going over budget	7	3
and all the awards Ted's already won for them.	7	3
They're upset about winning?	7	3
You know clients hate awards.	7	3
That's why Ogilvy never submits.	7	3
He does it for the clients. Trust me.	7	3
Wasn't Ogilvy the chairman of the Clios last year?	7	3
That's comforting-- you weren't rejected.	7	3
You weren't even considered.	7	3
- Are we finished? - Sorry about that.	7	3
- You want to go to color? - Ask your boss.	7	3
I'm usually by his side.	7	3
The real challenge in our life has been trying to get Rocky's attention.	7	3
Rocky.	7	3
I told you last time to tell him that I'm an admirer.	7	3
( Chuckles )	7	3
After Henry patched things up,	7	3
he'd hoped to be on the short list for AG.	7	3
Attorney general.	7	3
But I shouldn't be talking about this.	7	3
How are things in real estate?	7	3
I'm a travel agent, Betty.	7	3
But you're still going to take that exam again, aren't you?	7	3
No, it's going swimmingly.	7	3
I'm in the office three days a week now.	7	3
"""Wanderlust Travel."""	7	3
- That's spicy. - Take a few.	7	3
I'm sure you'll need them.	7	3
Henry's secretary takes care of all that.	7	3
But she still has to book through somebody.	7	3
Trust me, it's not all about breaking the rack rate on a hotel room.	7	3
It's about perfection.	7	3
One of my clients told me that I redefined	7	3
his definition of first class.	7	3
Three days a week in an office.	7	3
What's that like?	7	3
It's a little shopping center in Dobbs Ferry.	7	3
Just a storefront, really. A bunch of desks.	7	3
Everybody's on the phone all the time,	7	3
so you have to keep one finger in your ear.	7	3
I have three phones and no secretary.	7	3
Sometimes I can't turn my neck when I get home.	7	3
Doesn't Carlton complain?	7	3
He likes the money.	7	3
He wants me to let the girl go, and I probably should.	7	3
Ernie and Jenny are walking to school now.	7	3
Well, Gene's a few years away from that.	7	3
Oh, your time's occupied.	7	3
But for the rest of us,	7	3
as they get older, there's less and less to do.	7	3
Being alone in the house all that time.	7	3
I really needed a challenge.	7	3
Well, there's still plenty of challenges ahead, believe me.	7	3
Fine, I needed a reward.	7	3
I thought they were the reward.	7	3
I don't know. Maybe I'm old-fashioned.	7	3
Betty Draper, that is indeed how I would describe you.	7	3
I want that streusel coffee cake. Will you split?	7	3
Of course.	7	3
Well, hello. How are you doing, Tom?	7	3
- Randall. - Good.	7	3
Our good friends at Koss here, and frankly I'll include myself,	7	3
have a few questions for you.	7	3
I'd love to explain anything.	7	3
I think it's the media plan we agreed upon.	7	3
No.	7	3
It's about this article from a few weeks back.	7	3
Yes, I've seen this, obviously.	7	3
I'm very happy with our media plan,	7	3
but Grey has this computer that they're opening up to everybody.	7	3
We just thought maybe we should look into it.	7	3
Or you should.	7	3
Look, may I sit down?	7	3
This is a very enviable piece of PR.	7	3
"Grey gets ""The New York Times"" to tell all about their computer"	7	3
by offering their services up to the world.	7	3
But I swear, as clever as it is, it's just PR.	7	3
I'm an engineer.	7	3
You can explain to me what the difference is	7	3
between their computer and your computer.	7	3
Well, computers don't think. People do.	7	3
And the data accumulated by me and my department	7	3
reflects the same national availability of media.	7	3
What we will be able to offer soon is local data as well.	7	3
We will be able to integrate local and national markets into one report.	7	3
We are developing that program.	7	3
There you have it.	7	3
You'll forgive me,	7	3
but Grey's does sound very impressive.	7	3
They're a different kind of agency.	7	3
I wasn't even invited to this meeting because this is about your business.	7	3
Koss, that's the only name that should be in the paper.	7	3
Very well put.	7	3
Tom, does that put you at ease?	7	3
I'm really sorry to put you through that.	7	3
Randy warned me, but, you know, I got to ask.	7	3
( laughs )	7	3
I'll walk you out.	7	3
You said you wanted to poke your head in and say hi to Peggy?	7	3
It's good to see you. Got to get you out on that boat.	7	3
Thank you, Jim. Harry, always a pleasure.	7	3
What are you smiling about?	7	3
Did you not call for a fireman?	7	3
Why the hell is Grey Advertising coming up in my meeting?	7	3
Well, that article could have been about us	7	3
if anyone appreciated our media department.	7	3
Are you aware your self-pity is distasteful?	7	3
You know what? This conversation is over.	7	3
I'm really not interested.	7	3
( Car approaches )	7	3
Hello.	7	3
You're here! You surprised me!	7	3
Maybe I got your hints.	7	3
I've never, ever admitted that I wanted this.	7	3
What happened? Did you get fired?	7	3
I just had a hankering.	7	3
Really?	7	3
Well, an extra special hankering you shall get.	7	3
( TV playing )	7	3
Hello.	7	3
Loretta, please.	7	3
They're not watching.	7	3
No, I believe they're not interested in that.	7	3
Aren't you helping Bobby with his homework?	7	3
Yes, ma'am.	7	3
You got to sign this slip for Bobby's field trip.	7	3
How was everyone today?	7	3
They're little angels.	7	3
They're looking for chaperones. I can take Genie along.	7	3
Well, if you can remember to turn this in, I want to go along.	7	3
You do? You're gonna come?	7	3
Yes. Yes, lam.	7	3
Great. It's Miss Keyser's dad's farm.	7	3
She grew up there and they make butter and grow eggs.	7	3
Well, we'll see all that, won't we?	7	3
I'm going to change.	7	3
I really needed that.	7	3
I really needed this.	7	3
So I could have been anyone.	7	3
It's your own fault.	7	3
I think I've been alone too much.	7	3
You have so many friends, I can't keep track.	7	3
I don't know.	7	3
(Sighs)	7	3
It's sunny here for everyone but me.	7	3
"I'm walking around in a cloud of ""no."""	7	3
Megan, you know, they're getting rejected, too.	7	3
Maybe they're just handling it better.	7	3
That's a terrible thing to say.	7	3
I'm speaking from experience.	7	3
You can't let it erode your confidence.	7	3
And you can't get angry or desperate.	7	3
I know that.	7	3
I know all that.	7	3
What the hell are you doing here?	7	3
Alan called me.	7	3
What? He called you?	7	3
I'm your husband. He was worried.	7	3
Great, now l have to fire him.	7	3
What am I gonna do? How am I gonna find someone new?	7	3
You don't have to fire anyone.	7	3
You just have to stop acting like a lunatic.	7	3
What did he say?	7	3
You know what? Forget it.	7	3
So you came out here to what?	7	3
Pull me out of a bathtub where I slit my wrists?	7	3
I'll admit it, I was worried.	7	3
Well, thanks for the visit, Daddy.	7	3
I was stupid for thinking you could possibly miss me.	7	3
I do miss you.	7	3
No, you don't.	7	3
I should fly in and surprise you.	7	3
Yeah, that's a scary thought, isn't it?	7	3
- No. - Really?	7	3
You're never there when I call	7	3
and you always have to call me back.	7	3
And it's always quiet.	7	3
Where is it quiet in that office?	7	3
And I've never even heard a typewriter.	7	3
- That's not true. - Yes, it is true.	7	3
I'm sorry I had to interrupt your love affairs	7	3
with the disaster of my career.	7	3
Megan, sit down.	7	3
I was your secretary, remember?	7	3
I know what you're like when you're left alone.	7	3
- You're acting crazy. - So where are you?	7	3
Why can't I reach you? Who's your new girl, Don?	7	3
There is no one else.	7	3
I've been at home.	7	3
They put me on leave, okay?	7	3
You lost your job?	7	3
Don't worry, I'm still getting paid.	7	3
I don't give a shit. When did this happen?	7	3
Right after you left.	7	3
They fired you last year?	7	3
I didn't get fired. That's the thing.	7	3
I don't know if they want me or they don't want me.	7	3
Why didn't you tell me?	7	3
Because I messed up	7	3
and I didn't want you to know until I fixed it.	7	3
And there is no one else. I've been good.	7	3
I haven't even been drinking that much.	7	3
So with a clear head,	7	3
you got up every day and decided	7	3
that you didn't want to be with me?	7	3
Megan.	7	3
(Sighs)	7	3
Mm, I'm not walking out of my own house.	7	3
So that means you have to leave.	7	3
Have you calmed down?	7	3
I'm not kidding around.	7	3
I want you to call a cab, get on a plane, go home.	7	3
I don't want you to worry about me anymore.	7	3
- Stop it. - It's okay, Don.	7	3
This is the way it ends.	7	3
It's going to be so much easier for both of us.	7	3

I felt badly about diminishing your contributions	7	3
in this morning's meeting.	7	3
And let's face it, this computer situation is an arms race.	7	3
There's no point in winning if people don't know.	7	3
Well, we're not winning. We don't have a computer.	7	3
What?	7	3
Believe me, I ask for one every Christmas	7	3
and no one even bothers to say no.	7	3
Well, why did you tell the client we do?	7	3
It's semantics.	7	3
We use a computer, therefore I call it our computer.	7	3
But it's actually someone else's computer.	7	3
And the local markets program?	7	3
It's a great idea.	7	3
I'm sure someone's going to do that.	7	3
You have stiff competition, but I believe you to be	7	3

( Exhales )	7	3
Well, while we're digesting,	7	3
perhaps you should do a little digesting.	7	3
You can look at it now or you can put it in your pocket,	7	3
but you can't use it as a coaster.	7	3
Why don't you just tell me what's in it?	7	3
Why don't you look?	7	3
- That's coy. - No, that's drama.	7	3
Woman: Excuse me.	7	3
I'm sure you caught my eye during dinner.	7	3
I was only staring because I believe we know each other.	7	3
Emily Arnett?	7	3
I'm afraid I can't place you.	7	3
I'm sorry.	7	3
I don't mean to interrupt anything.	7	3
Would you like to join us?	7	3
No, I'm off to bed.	7	3
Hopefully I'll be able to sleep.	7	3
I'm on the top floor right next to the elevator.	7	3
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.	7	3
Have a good night.	7	3
Who was she?	7	3
Fellas, there's no need for the hard sell.	7	3
We had nothing to do with that.	7	3
I wish I'd thought of it.	7	3
Should we get another drink or do you have someplace to be?	7	3
( Chuckles )	7	3
( knocks )	7	3
Hello.	7	3
What are you doing here?	7	3
Are you alone?	7	3
For the time being.	7	3
I came by because I had a quick question.	7	3
- Shoot. - How do you sleep at night?	7	3
You know what? I called you at Christmas.	7	3
I'm sorry I opened the door. I was expecting a BLT.	7	3
Why would I want to talk to you when you fired me?	7	3
"I got the message. ""Merry Christmas, love, Judas."""	7	3
What is this?	7	3
That's a nice offer.	7	3
They're really trying to make it sound like it's not a demotion.	7	3
So I take the job? That's your advice?	7	3
If that's what you want to do.	7	3
Well, I know what you want me to do. Go away.	7	3
I guess you don't remember I started that company.	7	3
I had to talk you into it.	7	3
I guess you forgot I found you at the bottom of a fur box.	7	3
I would never have done that to you.	7	3
Oh, come on. Don't be a big baby about it.	7	3
You were a disaster. We did you a favor.	7	3
The man who talked to Hershey?	7	3
I've seen that man wandering the streets with a sandwich board	7	3
"saying ""The end is near."""	7	3
- So I have my answer. - I didn't know the question?	7	3
You want to come back? Come back.	7	3
I miss you.	7	3
( Knocking on door)	7	3
- Who is it? - Sherry: Room service.	7	3
Oh.	7	3
I didn't know we had company.	7	3
Yeah, for once, it's a friend of mine.	7	3
Sherry, this is Don.	7	3
I was just leaving.	7	3
Come in Monday.	7	3
(phone ringing)	7	3
- Megan: Hello? - It's me.	7	3
Hello.	7	3
I wanted to hear your voice.	7	3
I don't have a lot to say.	7	3
Then you can just listen.	7	3
I...	7	3
I shouldn't have lied to you.	7	3
And I'm sorry.	7	3
And I want everything to be okay.	7	3
(Sighs)	7	3
Are you there?	7	3
Yes.	7	3
I can see now that I wasn't...	7	3
thinking clearly	7	3
and I had this logic to what I did and...	7	3
hopefully now...	7	3
things can be the way we want them to be	7	3
because I'm going back to the agency.	7	3
Good for you.	7	3
I don't know if I can undo it, but I think I fixed it.	7	3
"""I fixed it"" is you got a job out here."	7	3
That's what you promised me. That's why I'm here.	7	3
I just thought that if you found out what happened...	7	3
you wouldn't look at me in the same way.	7	3
I can't believe after all this time you don't know me.	7	3
I know how I want you to see me.	7	3
Don't lie to me.	7	3
Don't do that.	7	3
You can't do that.	7	3
I'm your wife.	7	3
Stop pushing me away with both hands.	7	3
I could come back out.	7	3
I have the weekend.	7	3
( Sniffles )	7	3
(Sighs)	7	3
Not now.	7	3
It's not a good idea.	7	3
I love you.	7	3
Good night.	7	3
There's basically Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolf Man,	7	3
the Mummy, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon.	7	3
- That's quite a few. - There's also King Kong, too,	7	3
but he's not really a monster.	7	3
I like all of them, but I guess Wolf Man's my favorite	7	3
because he changes into it.	7	3
Dracula changes into a bat.	7	3
That's true.	7	3
16, 18...	7	3
It's nice to see somebody getting along.	7	3
We were having a conversation.	7	3
Thank you so much for helping out.	7	3
( Bus thumps)	7	3
Makes my job so much easier.	7	3
Bobby asked and I couldn't say no.	7	3
My mom loves animals.	7	3
She really likes you.	7	3
Yes, well, that blouse says she likes everyone.	7	3
It's Lou, right?	7	3
Oh, hello there.	7	3
Good to see you.	7	3
Sure.	7	3
How are you, Don?	7	3
Ready to get back to work.	7	3
Good for you.	7	3
Hello there.	7	3
Oh, Don! Look at you.	7	3
- How are you? - I'm good.	7	3
It's been too long.	7	3
Here I am.	7	3
Why don't you let me take that up to him?	7	3
( laughs ) To Roger?	7	3
No, he's not in yet. That's mine.	7	3
Do you want some?	7	3
When do you expect him? I think we have a meeting.	7	3
I'm always the last to know.	7	3
It's fine.	7	3
I'll keep myself occupied.	7	3
Great to see you again.	7	3
Keep that.	7	3
- Is Jim Cutler in yet? - I think he's at breakfast.	7	3
I don't care if he's in bed with Joey Heatherton.	7	3
Get him on the horn.	7	3
Ginsberg: Don?	7	3
Is that you?	7	3
Hello, Michael.	7	3
Ed, come here. Look who's here.	7	3
Oh, hi, Don. Great to see you.	7	3
Boy, you smell good.	7	3
Hey, you know what? Are you busy?	7	3
- What do you mean? - Don't bother him.	7	3
He'll know. Come here.	7	3
Chevalier Blanc has started Chevalier Noir.	7	3
"That's ""night,"" or ""black."""	7	3
Either way, it's the opposite of Blanc.	7	3
And we're supposed to work up print	7	3
"based on this voiceover tagline, ""More horsepower."""	7	3
And you gotta see the words, but it ends with a freeze-frame.	7	3
What does?	7	3
The TV spot.	7	3
Oh. I assume you have storyboards.	7	3
Exit stage left.	7	3
What have you been up to, Don?	7	3
Just R&R mostly.	7	3
Do you want to see the strategy?	7	3
Sure.	7	3
What happened to the storyboards from Chevalier Noir?	7	3
She gave them to Lou.	7	3
What do I do? Don wants to see 'em.	7	3
- Don? - Don-- Draper.	7	3
Says who?	7	3
Says him. He's outside.	7	3
Right now? What's he doing here?	7	3
You want I should ask him?	7	3
What's he doing?	7	3
Who cares?	7	3
- What's going on? - Shh! Look.	7	3
What is he doing here?	7	3
Maybe he finished drying out.	7	3
Meredith, we better get back to work.	7	3
Hello, Don.	7	3
Hello, Stan.	7	3
Where you been? Riding the rails?	7	3
- Turns out Lou's got the boards. - It's fine.	7	3
Mr. Draper.	7	3
Morning, Dawn.	7	3
Seems to be some lapse in communication	7	3
regarding my return.	7	3
No one told me.	7	3
Could you just let me know when someone tracks down Mr. Sterling?	7	3
- Can I get some coffee? - Certainly.	7	3
Why don't you fellas catch me up?	7	3
You want me to get everything?	7	3
Whatever you got handy.	7	3
Let's start with the garbage.	7	3
( Cow moos )	7	3
Children, this is my father, Farmer Cy.	7	3
"You can call me Cyrus or Cy or ""hey, mister."""	7	3
( laughs )	7	3
If you look around, you can see pigs	7	3
and goats and chickens.	7	3
And Pammy's favorite, the horsies.	7	3
We've got all the animals.	7	3
But this farm is mostly for growing potatoes,	7	3
so there's not a lot above ground.	7	3
But I know you're all here to see the cows.	7	3
So why don't we walk this way?	7	3
I'm sorry, ladies, but there's no smoking in the barn.	7	3
I'll be along.	7	3
You're not afraid of missing them milk the cow?	7	3
I'll be done in a minute.	7	3
Well, I hope no one accidentally grabs on the wrong udders.	7	3
Excuse me?	7	3
Farmer's daughter needs a bra.	7	3
( laughs )	7	3
( clicking )	7	3
- Mm-hmm. - Do you need my lighter?	7	3
Would you mind?	7	3
Don? ls that you?	7	3
Boys, excuse me a minute.	7	3
Don, what a pleasant surprise.	7	3
You're looking well, Joan.	7	3
What have you been up to? What are you doing here?	7	3
- Waiting. - For what?	7	3
You two just getting in?	7	3
We had a breakfast meeting.	7	3
What are you doing here?	7	3
I guess I'm waiting for Roger.	7	3
Oh, I see.	7	3
Well...	7	3
it was nice seeing you.	7	3
Guess what. Cynthia had a little boy.	7	3
Edward, but we call him Eddie.	7	3
Eddie Cosgrove.	7	3
That's the carousel in Central Park.	7	3
Always makes me think of you.	7	3
Now I know what you'll look like bald.	7	3
( laughs )	7	3
( knocks ) May I have a word?	7	3
Don't linger in the door.	7	3
I'm wearing boots.	7	3
Yes, fine, dear.	7	3
Did you know that Don Draper is downstairs?	7	3
Doing what?	7	3
He says he's waiting for Roger. Does that ring a bell?	7	3
He shouldn't be here.	7	3
So obviously I would like to get married,	7	3
but, you know, I don't really have any savings.	7	3
I mean, it doesn't make any sense to borrow money from my parents	7	3
just so I look successful in front of hers, does it?	7	3
I don't know. That is a tough spot.	7	3
What the hell is going on in here?	7	3
We were just catching up.	7	3
That's nice, ladies. You four, in my office.	7	3
- We have that meeting. - What meeting?	7	3
Sorry, Don.	7	3
( Cow moos )	7	3
Don't get no fresher than that.	7	3
Who wants to try it?	7	3
I will.	7	3
- Really? - Sure.	7	3
See how warm it is?	7	3
It's sweet.	7	3
Don.	7	3
Where the hell were you?	7	3
- Had an early lunch. - I can smell it.	7	3
I didn't know you were gonna beat me here.	7	3
You could have told somebody. Anybody.	7	3
I don't have to tell anybody. That's my name on the door out there.	7	3
This is my agency. I'm the president of this agency.	7	3
I don't have to ask anybody anything.	7	3
You know what? I could call a holiday for the whole office right now.	7	3
I've been sitting in here waiting for you.	7	3
I'm not gonna slink out of here with my tail between my legs.	7	3
- Now call a damn meeting. - Let me ask Joan.	7	3
- Don't ask Joan. - Wait here.	7	3
Chicken salad on rye and a Nesbitt's?	7	3
Yes, thank you, Dawn.	7	3
(children chattering )	7	3
You eat. I'm going to wash my hands.	7	3
Okay.	7	3
You can't sit there. That's my mom's spot.	7	3
Jim: Don?	7	3
Hello, Jim.	7	3
I'm surprised to see you.	7	3
Well, here I am.	7	3
Mr. Cutler, there you are.	7	3
I can go down to the lobby and sell newspapers,	7	3
but you're still gonna pay me.	7	3
- I have a two-year contract. - Calm down.	7	3
I'll find out what's going on and I'll take care of it.	7	3
What am I supposed to do?	7	3
Just hide while he sits down there	7	3
cooling his heels like Longfellow Deeds?	7	3
We're going to ask him to leave.	7	3
May I?	7	3
Be careful. I've seen this before.	7	3
You might want to call security.	7	3
A lot of bees over there.	7	3
They live in drawers.	7	3
- Where's my sandwich? - What do you mean?	7	3
There were two.	7	3
I traded it.	7	3
- You traded it? - With Susie Rogers.	7	3
She didn't have a sandwich.	7	3
I got her gumdrops.	7	3
Bobby, that was my lunch.	7	3
I'm sorry. I'll go get it back.	7	3
Stop it. It's fine.	7	3
- I'm sorry. - Sit down.	7	3
I'm sorry.	7	3
I swear I didn't know you were going to eat.	7	3
There were two sandwiches.	7	3
You want them?	7	3
No. You eat them.	7	3
But I don't want them.	7	3
Eat your candy.	7	3
Your shoes.	7	3
What about her?	7	3
I just discovered you're our best hope	7	3
to explain why Don Draper is downstairs.	7	3
He came to me in remorse and said he's ready to come back.	7	3
Oh, I see.	7	3
Well, unfortunately, we fired him.	7	3
No, we didn't.	7	3
We deliberately put him on leave in this very room.	7	3
We didn't fire him. I would never agree to that.	7	3
The leave of absence was a very clear message.	7	3
We were allowing him to preserve his dignity	7	3
while seeking other employment.	7	3
Ah.	7	3
Well, I remember clearly that Cutler said	7	3
the leave of absence was to give him time to think.	7	3
I didn't want any more rancor.	7	3
Is that what you thought? That we fired him?	7	3
Not necessarily, but I did expect	7	3
to revisit the topic after some time as a group.	7	3
Well, here we are. Let's take a vote.	7	3
- I'll speak for Ted. - And I'll speak for Pete.	7	3
All I can say is that Don is a very talented man,	7	3
but how does he fit into everything now?	7	3
This is working.	7	3
Besides, we're still mopping up the damage he's done.	7	3
I do not like the way this agency is spoken of out there.	7	3
You don't think that's because our creative is invisible right now?	7	3
One nomination.	7	3
Lou didn't put in anything he couldn't tag his name on.	7	3
He barely worked here last year.	7	3
Lou is adequate.	7	3
I think it's more important we discuss Harry Crane.	7	3
Harry Crane?	7	3
He's gone. Anything else?	7	3
This agency is too dependent on creative personalities.	7	3
You're still talking for Ted?	7	3
If we want people speaking about this agency,	7	3
what they should be speaking about is our media department.	7	3
We need to invest in a computer, period.	7	3
We need to tell our clients we're thinking about the future,	7	3
not creative hijinks.	7	3
Don is a genius.	7	3
He's costing us a fortune!	7	3
- You hate him. - I don't!	7	3
I hate what he did to Ted.	7	3
Enough! This is a financial decision.	7	3
Obviously, it's not.	7	3
Right now Don draws a sizable salary	7	3
and has a partnership stake.	7	3
That costs more than a computer.	7	3
- He has a contract. - He's in breach.	7	3
No, he's not. He's on leave!	7	3
And even if we do fire him, he's a partner.	7	3
We have to buy him out.	7	3
That's true.	7	3
That's a big hit.	7	3
As tough as it is, I'm confident	7	3
it'll be more profitable in the long term.	7	3
"Since when are you allowed to use the words ""long term"" in this office?"	7	3
It'll be 1973 before we're even.	7	3
We fire him, we lose the noncompete.	7	3
You want to walk down some hotel hallway	7	3
and see Mary Wells sitting on Don's lap the next time you go in to present?	7	3
( TV playing )	7	3
How was the farm?	7	3
How was your day?	7	3
Did you eat?	7	3
I'm not hungry.	7	3
I was hungry, but now I'm not.	7	3
It was a long day.	7	3
I'm going to give Gene a bath.	7	3
Come on, Genie.	7	3
What happened?	7	3
I wish it was yesterday.	7	3
- Man: Have a good night. - Woman: Good night, George.	7	3
(phone ringing)	7	3
How was your day?	7	3
That remains to be seen.	7	3
Are you coming back?	7	3
I thought so.	7	3
Now I'm not so sure.	7	3
Well, I can't say that we miss you.	7	3
Thank you, Peggy.	7	3
( TV playing )	7	3
What happened?	7	3
I couldn't get it out of Bobby.	7	3
It was a perfect day and he ruined it.	7	3
How is that possible, Betty?	7	3
Do you think I'm a good mother?	7	3
Of course.	7	3
Then why don't they love me?	7	3
What are you talking about?	7	3
Look at him.	7	3
It's just a matter of time.	7	3
Mr. Draper.	7	3
Yes. Dawn...	7	3
can I get some coffee?	7	3
Of course, but they want to see you in the conference room--	7	3
the partners.	7	3
Oh.	7	3
Hello, everyone.	7	3
Come on, sit down.	7	3
- Bert, how are you? - Capital.	7	3
Well, this is the meeting I assumed you were going to have	7	3
before I came, Roger.	7	3
Sorry if I disrupted your day,	7	3
but I've had a productive time catching myself up with everything.	7	3
Well, we've discussed it and we've reached the conclusion	7	3
that we'd like you to come back to work.	7	3
I'm pleased to hear that.	7	3
But there are some stipulations.	7	3
Violation of which will result in termination	7	3
and a reabsorption of your partnership shares.	7	3
You are not allowed to be alone with clients.	7	3
You are to stick to the script in meetings	7	3
and that means the script will be approved	7	3
by the people in this room.	7	3
Outside of client hospitality, there will be no drinking in the office.	7	3
You'll be in Lane's old office.	7	3
And you will report to Lou.	7	3

Well, now, we have three options--	7	4
Catalina, which includes a boat ride one of us will enjoy,	7	4
Yosemite, which is a very long drive,	7	4
or Palm Springs, which--	7	4
are you listening to me?	7	4
Don't look.	7	4
Turn around.	7	4
That man is staring at me.	7	4
Well, I'm relieved that you weren't looking for a better conversation.	7	4
 It's a little rude, but I'm fine.	7	4
- What were you saying? - Very well.	7	4
What are you doing?	7	4
George?	7	4
I didn't want to bother you.	7	4
You're obviously here on business.	7	4
What?	7	4
No.	7	4
Trudy and I are divorced-- getting divorced.	7	4
I've relocated to our West Coast office.	7	4
George Payton, this is Bonnie, my real estate agent.	7	4
I wish you would stop introducing me that way.	7	4
Why? It's good for business.	7	4
Okay, what if I say,	7	4
" ""Bonnie, my girlfriend, your real estate agent""?"	7	4
- Nice to meet you. - Charmed.	7	4
What brings you to L.A.? There's no cough-and-cold season.	7	4
- George works for Vicks. - Oh.	7	4
Actually, I left. Please, sit.	7	4
I'm working for Burger Chef now.	7	4
You can't be in the hamburger business	7	4
without taking a swing at Disneyland.	7	4
When did that happen?	7	4
Right after Tom's heart attack.	7	4
I thought of you.	7	4
- Tom who? - Tom Vogel.	7	4
He had a heart attack?	7	4
Who's that?	7	4
My father-in-law.	7	4
I hadn't heard about that.	7	4
He's fine.	7	4
Who knew he had a heart?	7	4
Yes, right.	7	4
You know we're putting McCann in review.	7	4
Be nice for us to work together without old Tom in the way.	7	4
Hm.	7	4
It would kill him.	7	4
( Chuckles )	7	4
Do you want to join us?	7	4
How about I give you a call when I get back to the home office?	7	4
Of course.	7	4
Have a wonderful evening.	7	4
I love watching you work.	7	4
That was skillful.	7	4
Those conversations happen all the time.	7	4
Doesn't mean anything.	7	4
( Elevator bell dings )	7	4
( slow tapping )	7	4
( faint chatter)	7	4
Cutler: Accounts won't have to search for a conversation starter	7	4
and creative will benefit from accurate data.	7	4
Ahem, any questions?	7	4
Where are we supposed to work?	7	4
You all have offices.	7	4
Lloyd, from LeaseTech, has informed us	7	4
that the footprint of the machine was prohibitive.	7	4
And then it occurred to us,	7	4
why not let every client who sets foot in that door	7	4
know that this agency has entered the future?	7	4
( Applause )	7	4
And please, we will try and keep the construction	7	4
and installation process as brief as possible,	7	4
but steer clear of the area for your own safety.	7	4
You might want to wear shoes.	7	4
Thank you all.	7	4
Dawn: If you have any personal items in the creative lounge,	7	4
please remove them immediately.	7	4
Anything left behind at noon today will be assumed garbage.	7	4
They're driving us underground.	7	4
You know Lou didn't fight for our space.	7	4
He doesn't believe in creative because he doesn't know how to do it.	7	4
Trust me, you're going to use that computer	7	4
more than you use that lounge.	7	4
Did he hear me?	7	4
Why were you late? You know that's a no-no.	7	4
I wasn't late. I didn't get a memo.	7	4
I don't even know what's going on.	7	4
Well, we're getting a computer.	7	4
It's going to do lots of magical things,	7	4
like make Harry Crane seem important.	7	4
This decision must have been made at the partners' level.	7	4
It preceded you.	7	4
You got a problem, take it up with Cutler.	7	4
Think it's too early to come in and celebrate	7	4
our technological advancement?	7	4
I think that's worse than being late, isn't it?	7	4
You're right. Good thinking.	7	4
Maybe later, off campus.	7	4
Harry Crane took a huge dump, and we got flushed down the toilet.	7	4
Ginsberg, don't you believe in advertising?	7	4
"That computer is the ""Mona Lisa."""	7	4
People pay entry to the whole Louvre	7	4
just to walk by that thing.	7	4
This is what was unique about this place.	7	4
I want the couch.	7	4
That is not going to fit in our office.	7	4
Why don't we switch it with the one in Lane's office?	7	4
Because that one's really good.	7	4
You mean Don's office?	7	4
Don! Will you take the other end of this?	7	4
Okay.	7	4
You gotta hold your side a little lower.	7	4
I'm on the heavy side of the seesaw right now.	7	4
A little to your right.	7	4
My right.	7	4
Damn it, Ginsberg. Put it back.	7	4
It's too big for our office.	7	4
Come on, Stan! I wanna try!	7	4
The other one's full of farts.	7	4
You're on your own.	7	4
Ginsberg: Let me put this in terms the art department can understand--	7	4
they're trying to erase us!	7	4
But they can't erase this couch!	7	4
( Sighs )	7	4
So, in addition to the fruitful nature	7	4
of our previous relationship at Vicks,	7	4
George is very excited about our bicoastal presence.	7	4
Are we concerned about a conflict with H. Salt Fish & Chips?	7	4
- Pete: Ted? - H. Salt views themselves	7	4
as a specialty restaurant, not fast food.	7	4
( Chuckles ) That's a joke, right?	7	4
Pete, what did your friend at Burger Chef say?	7	4
They're going to open their thousandth store	7	4
and that's across 45 states.	7	4
George Payton knows who his competition is	7	4
and he loves that we understand the franchise game.	7	4
Well, Ted, you're the king of fish and chips,	7	4
but I don't want you running the team from out there.	7	4
We're calling you home.	7	4
Sorry, Jim, I'm not going anywhere.	7	4
I think we should put Peggy on it.	7	4
This is a national campaign.	7	4
It's almost three million in billings.	7	4
The whole thing's about the kitchen	7	4
and the cleanliness and getting to the homemakers.	7	4
They'll want a woman.	7	4
Lou?	7	4
I think Peggy is the right choice.	7	4
Well, I'm glad we all agree the client is going to love	7	4
having a woman's point of view-- or whatever Peggy counts as--	7	4
but is Don not even on the list?	7	4
I was thinking the same thing.	7	4
He's spent three weeks alone in that cave,	7	4
and he hasn't clubbed another ape yet.	7	4
High praise indeed. Lou?	7	4
Don's a very valuable piece of talent.	7	4
He should be put to work already.	7	4
Absolutely.	7	4
Roger: Good work all around.	7	4
That's what I always say, this business is about relationships.	7	4
Bye-bye, boys.	7	4
Ted: Dee, we're done.	7	4
Let's see them give that to Bob Benson.	7	4
We done here?	7	4
I thought we had an understanding about Don.	7	4
There's nothing to be afraid of.	7	4
He's an exquisite copywriter, if nothing else.	7	4
He's gonna implode.	7	4
That's a distinct possibility, isn't it?	7	4
On the other hand, you might get some good work.	7	4
( Squealing )	7	4
( toy gun popping )	7	4
Hey, spud. Get over here.	7	4
- What's going on? - We're playing hide-and-go-seek.	7	4
You hear that, Caroline? Someone's hunting big game.	7	4
And someone's looking for you.	7	4
- Mommy here? - No, Daddy and Nana.	7	4
They're in there.	7	4
Ellery and I are supposed to go play.	7	4
See you later, alligator.	7	4
( pops )	7	4
Mona, Brooks.	7	4
What a pleasant surprise.	7	4
- Margaret's run away. - To where? Bergdorf's?	7	4
It's not a joke.	7	4
She's upstate with some sort of religious cult.	7	4
- What? - It's a commune.	7	4
You don't know that.	7	4
- What the hell happened? - I can't get a straight story.	7	4
Because I don't know why you need to know.	7	4
Apparently, she woke up one morning	7	4
and got in a van with some hippies that she barely knew.	7	4
She's only been gone a few days.	7	4
10. Brooks and I think it best if you go up there and retrieve her.	7	4
The only reason I even told you	7	4
is because I need someone to watch my son,	7	4
and I thought it best it be family.	7	4
If you don't want to do it,	7	4
I've got a long list of strangers I can pay.	7	4
You're upset.	7	4
You're not thinking right.	7	4
We can't help you if you don't tell us what happened.	7	4
Look, she hasn't been herself lately	7	4
and we went to this marriage encounter group.	7	4
( Chuckles ) You're kidding.	7	4
She wanted to, and I thought it would be good for her to talk to people.	7	4
That's always a mistake.	7	4
Roger!	7	4
Brooks, sweetheart,	7	4
I don't mind watching my grandson,	7	4
but it sounds like you tried to stop her	7	4
and you obviously failed.	7	4
- A father is a powerful thing. - What are you doing?	7	4
Of course, she'll watch him. Let the man be a man.	7	4
I appreciate that, sir. I'm gonna go say good-bye.	7	4
I'm telling him that I'm joining her on vacation.	7	4
Good idea.	7	4
- ( Door closes ) - What kind of a sales pitch was that?	7	4
- That was terrible. - I agree with him.	7	4
She is off her rocker and she has run away with,	7	4
from what I can glean, more than one lover.	7	4
I only know one other person who would do something like that.	7	4
How is this my fault?	7	4
Because she is a perverse child who only thinks of herself.	7	4
Look, I know you're upset.	7	4
I am terribly worried.	7	4
It'll be fine.	7	4
( Door closes )	7	4
- ( distant hammering ) - ( drills whirring)	7	4
Harry: Well, it was a variety show,	7	4
and it featured this computer that was programming the variety acts.	7	4
And they had a lot of psychedelic graphics.	7	4
It was obvious that whoever did the sets	7	4
had never seen the IBM 360, I can say.	7	4
Lloyd: Maybe I'll go buy a TV. I can catch it.	7	4
You should get a TV, but it got cancelled	7	4
11 minutes into the premiere.	7	4
Tim Conway plays a guy who's trying to kill himself the whole show.	7	4
Probably to get out of his contract.	7	4
Don Draper, this is Lloyd Hawley.	7	4
- Lloyd's with LeaseTech. - I saw you at the announcement.	7	4
And what do you do around here, Don?	7	4
Oh, Don is, uh, a partner and our creative director.	7	4
I thought Lou was the creative director.	7	4
- We have two. - We have three.	7	4
I mean, there's Ted, too.	7	4
You must have a hell of a business right now.	7	4
We'll see.	7	4
It's tough, because we both sell IBM's product and compete with them.	7	4
Who's winning? Who's replacing more humans?	7	4
Listen, I apologize about your work area.	7	4
It wasn't my idea.	7	4
Look, I'm sorry you lost your lunchroom.	7	4
- It's not symbolic. - No, it's quite literal.	7	4
I'll talk to you later, Lloyd. Some of us have work to do.	7	4
That's why I supervise the installations.	7	4
There's always some kind of trouble.	7	4
Don't worry, that goes back years.	7	4
Well, I go into businesses every day, and it's been my experience	7	4
these machines can be a metaphor for whatever's on people's minds.	7	4
Because they're afraid of computers?	7	4
Yes. This machine is frightening to people,	7	4
but it's made by people.	7	4
People aren't frightening?	7	4
It's not that.	7	4
It's more of a cosmic disturbance.	7	4
This machine is intimidating	7	4
because it contains infinite quantities of information,	7	4
and that's threatening, because human existence is finite.	7	4
But isn't it godlike that we've mastered the infinite?	7	4
The IBM 360 can count more stars in a day	7	4
than we can in a lifetime.	7	4
But what man laid on his back counting stars	7	4
and thought about a number?	7	4
He probably thought about going to the moon.	7	4
Pleasure to meet you, Lloyd. I should get back in there.	7	4
- You wanted to see me? - Close the door.	7	4
( Hammering fades )	7	4
It's quite a view, isn't it?	7	4
I like to think of myself as a leader, Peggy,	7	4
and that means doling out discipline.	7	4
But it also means tempering it with encouragement.	7	4
Which should I be prepared for?	7	4
I didn't hire you, but I would have,	7	4
and I would've paid you as befits your senior status.	7	4
I'm giving you $100 more a week.	7	4
I'm writing it on this piece of paper	7	4
because I've found that saying things around here...	7	4
is useless.	7	4
Well, I...	7	4
appreciate that.	7	4
Very much.	7	4
Well, with it comes a mission.	7	4
I'm putting you in charge of Burger Chef.	7	4
Really?	7	4
Carve out hours for whomever you want on the team.	7	4
And Don.	7	4
- Don Draper? - He's the one.	7	4
Thank you so much, Lou.	7	4
Knock 'em dead.	7	4
Have you told Don?	7	4
You're in charge, sweetheart.	7	4
- ( Tools whirring, buzzing ) - ( phones ringing )	7	4
- ls he in? - He never leaves.	7	4
Marsha, can you bring Don and Mathis to my office?	7	4
Certainly.	7	4
( Knocking on door)	7	4
Come in.	7	4
Please don't eat that. You're so trim.	7	4
- Anything else? - Miss Olson would like to see you.	7	4
Send her in.	7	4
No, I'm to send you in.	7	4
Okay.	7	4
- You wanted to see me? - Can I offer you something?	7	4
It was a long walk, but no.	7	4
I have what I think is very good news.	7	4
I hope you'll see it that way.	7	4
Hey, Don.	7	4
I don't know if you've heard the rumors,	7	4
but Pete Campbell has gotten us a presentation with Burger Chef.	7	4
All I know is it's national fast food.	7	4
- They run a new spot every month. - That's right.	7	4
But we have to win it first,	7	4
and that's why I wanted you both on my team.	7	4
Congratulations.	7	4
Congratulations to you.	7	4
Mathis: How long do we have?	7	4
I don't know yet, but I want to get started right away.	7	4
I think 25 tags should get the ball rolling.	7	4
- I'll get right on it. - Apiece.	7	4
That's 50 total between the two of you.	7	4
- What's the strategy? - Lou likes to start with the tags	7	4
and then sneak up on a strategy.	7	4
You'll get used to it.	7	4
Well, that'll do it.	7	4
- Thanks for thinking of me. - I look forward to your work.	7	4
Monday.	7	4
( Door closes )	7	4
( door slams )	7	4
( elevator bell dings )	7	4
- How was your weekend? - Lonely.	7	4
- How was yours? - Wouldn't you like to know?	7	4
Oh, I'm sorry.	7	4
You have a meeting with Miss Olson,	7	4
and the Burger Chef research came in.	7	4
- Is he in? - Yes.	7	4
Good.	7	4
Oh, good.	7	4
Don't act like you were looking for me.	7	4
I was looking for you.	7	4
I need coffee. I didn't sleep last night.	7	4
Well, Mona called,	7	4
and I'm supposed to read you this message.	7	4
"""Hey, genius! Brooks is in jail in Kingston."""	7	4
From now on, you don't listen to her,	7	4
you listen to me.	7	4
And what I really like is no matter what you order,	7	4
they give you a side of spaghetti,	7	4
even if you order spaghetti.	7	4
What, Burger Chef does?	7	4
No, Vito's.	7	4
I can go get him.	7	4
Don: Come in.	7	4
It's time for the meeting.	7	4
I can't make it.	7	4
Oh.	7	4
Do you want me to turn in your tags?	7	4
Nope.	7	4
Okay.	7	4
He's not coming.	7	4
- What? - That's what he said.	7	4
Is that right?	7	4
I guess he's not ready.	7	4
I mean, we did just get the research.	7	4
I would really appreciate a chance to beef these up, as it were.	7	4
I mean, if Don's going to get more time...	7	4
Here's a better idea.	7	4
Why don't we move the meeting to the end of the day,	7	4
and you give me what you've got now plus 25 more?	7	4
That's going to be 50.	7	4
But now you have the research.	7	4
( Bangs glove box)	7	4
- Hey. - Nothing works.	7	4
You need to calm down.	7	4
"I don't want this turning into ""The Guiding Light"""	7	4
the moment we get there.	7	4
Ha. I'm worried, but you're angry.	7	4
Don't lose your temper. How much cash do you have?	7	4
Why don't you reach in and check?	7	4
His bail is 180.	7	4
Let Brooks spend another day in the slammer.	7	4
- He'll just get in the way. - No, obviously.	7	4
I meant we should spring him on the way back.	7	4
He's a bum.	7	4
If he wasn't a bum, she wouldn't have left him.	7	4
She told him she was never leaving that place	7	4
and that he and Ellery could stay there.	7	4
What was he supposed to do?	7	4
He was supposed to get into a fight with those hippies,	7	4
not some rednecks in a bar three hours later.	7	4
It's my fault.	7	4
I always let her out of everything.	7	4
She only had one job and that was to find a husband,	7	4
and she mucked it up.	7	4
You liked him.	7	4
I thought he was good enough for the time being.	7	4
( Sighs )	7	4
I wanted her to wait like I did.	7	4
You only waited because I wasn't available.	7	4
Well, look how that worked out.	7	4
What was she supposed to think?	7	4
"""Things are hard. I'll just find another man."""	7	4
That can't be it.	7	4
Oh, God, I hope she's not a drug addict--	7	4
although they usually stay in the city.	7	4
"- How do you know that? - ""Life"" magazine."	7	4
It's probably another man, who probably has drugs.	7	4
You and me is not such a bad example.	7	4
I mean, what psychiatrist is Ellery going to be telling one day	7	4
about the weekend his dad was in jail	7	4
and his mom was on a commune?	7	4
I'm sure you can recommend one.	7	4
You know, I haven't seen her in a while,	7	4
because the last time I did, she was so cruel and so serene.	7	4
She has been strange lately.	7	4
And a little bit philosophical?	7	4
Yes.	7	4
( Chuckles )	7	4
I thought she was finally happy.	7	4
( Knocks on door)	7	4
Come in.	7	4
Sorry to bother you.	7	4
Do you have a light? Mine crapped out on me.	7	4
The perils of technology.	7	4
It's 1969 and you're unable to make fire.	7	4
Human error. Forgot to fill it.	7	4
You're the only one here. It's lunchtime.	7	4
I'm not hungry.	7	4
Probably have too much to do.	7	4
I'm not doing anything.	7	4
Look, I don't want to put you out, but if you have a second...	7	4
I have an advertising question.	7	4
Hmm.	7	4
Go ahead.	7	4
Advertising-- does it work?	7	4
On some people.	7	4
It helps to have a good product.	7	4
I'll tell you how great it is.	7	4
I started LeaseTech with two old friends,	7	4
and six months later, we have 19 new employees	7	4
and three new competitors.	7	4
Well, the first question is how is what you're selling unique?	7	4
IBM's leases are short and expensive	7	4
because they're always replacing the equipment with the newest model.	7	4
Ours are cheaper because we don't do that.	7	4
Don't yours become obsolete?	7	4
They all become obsolete eventually.	7	4
The question is, how long does that take?	7	4
IBM doesn't care because they just sell new machines.	7	4
At this point, I usually ask,	7	4
"""How did you get into this business?"""	7	4
Well, I was at IBM for a few years.	7	4
- I knew it. - Yes.	7	4
And I saw that they have got a great product,	7	4
but they don't trust it.	7	4
Now, I've worked with these machines.	7	4
I know how resilient they are.	7	4
I don't want to find them in a junkyard in two years.	7	4
So you're betting that they'll last longer than even IBM thinks?	7	4
Yeah.	7	4
But the problem is, so are a bunch of other companies.	7	4
But they don't have you,	7	4
and they don't advertise.	7	4
Very nice.	7	4
What's IBM like?	7	4
Oh, there you are. I thought we were going to lunch.	7	4
Thanks for the light. Pleasure to talk to you.	7	4
You were going to give me the name of a good keypunch service.	7	4
( Door closes )	7	4
- When's Roger back from lunch? - He's gone for the day.	7	4
- ( Knocks ) - You got a second, Bert?	7	4
Of course.	7	4
LeaseTech--	7	4
the company we're leasing the computer from-- is a virgin.	7	4
And I think we should prepare a presentation	7	4
while their guy is hanging around, push him over the edge.	7	4
New business?	7	4
That whole industry is exploding.	7	4
This guy has exponential growth.	7	4
Have you forgotten the stipulations?	7	4
Fine, tell somebody else.	7	4
I mean, the apple is right there.	7	4
You have a fundamental misunderstanding	7	4
of what went wrong here.	7	4
So, that's it? You want me to be a janitor?	7	4
Whistle while I work?	7	4
You thought there was going to be a big creative crisis	7	4
and we'd pull you off the bench,	7	4
but in fact, we've been doing just fine.	7	4
So, why am I even here? I could've gone anywhere.	7	4
- Why are you here? - Because I started this agency!	7	4
Along with a dead man whose office you now inhabit.	7	4
I left something in there.	7	4
When?	7	4
Thank you, Caroline. I got it.	7	4
What are you doing?	7	4
( Chickens clucking )	7	4
Are you looking to buy some jelly?	7	4
The stand's up the road.	7	4
No, we're looking for Margaret Sterling.	7	4
Hargrove. Margaret Hargrove.	7	4
I know who you're talking about.	7	4
Marigold!	7	4
She doesn't want any trouble, and we don't want any trouble.	7	4
Nor do we.	7	4
These two are looking for you.	7	4
You know 'em?	7	4
Of course I do.	7	4
This is my mother and father.	7	4
- Mother, you look wonderful. - Stop it.	7	4
I know why you're here,	7	4
and I just want to welcome you.	7	4
Margaret, darling, we just--	7	4
Could you call off your dogs?	7	4
I'd like to have a private conversation.	7	4
Hey, everybody, I understand the dry cleaning's ready,	7	4
but can you bring it back in an hour?	7	4
There's 50 bucks in it for you.	7	4
I'm fine, everyone. These are my parents.	7	4
Will you let me show you around at least,	7	4
before you start railing against something you don't understand?	7	4
I don't know what happened between you and Brooks,	7	4
but your son misses you.	7	4
Things have never been better between me and Brooks.	7	4
Even	7	4
And...	7	4
I miss Ellery so much.	7	4
I think about him all the time,	7	4
but he can't be happy if I'm not happy.	7	4
I didn't know how dire it was, but if you need money--	7	4
whatever you want, whatever you need.	7	4
She doesn't want money. Margaret, listen.	7	4
Sugarplum, these people are lost and on drugs,	7	4
and they have venereal diseases.	7	4
That's not for you.	7	4
You don't know them.	7	4
And I'm tired of accepting society's definition of me.	7	4
I don't pray to that anymore.	7	4
Darling, I understand.	7	4
Being a young mother can be overwhelming,	7	4
even with help.	7	4
You sit with your child at the end of the day	7	4
and you're exhausted and you don't even know what you did.	7	4
And everything you do seems wrong.	7	4
It's hard to accept that those are the definitions, but they are.	7	4
I'm sorry you had nothing to live for.	7	4
I did.	7	4
I had you, and I was grateful.	7	4
I'm grateful.	7	4
I don't have to lock myself in a bathroom	7	4
with a pint of gin every day.	7	4
I ought to slap you.	7	4
Why are you talking to your mother like that?	7	4
Daddy, I'm sorry.	7	4
I'm telling her the truth, and she doesn't want to hear it.	7	4
- Let's go! - ( Sighs )	7	4
You didn't even let me talk to her.	7	4
There's no more point in talking.	7	4
I'd think she was brainwashed, but there's nothing to wash.	7	4
You can't make her turn on a dime. You'll embarrass her.	7	4
Fine. You want to wine and dine the account, Roger?	7	4
Knock yourself out.	7	4
There's a four-year-old in Manhattan crying himself to sleep.	7	4
I'll get Cletus to drive me to the train.	7	4
( Door slams, engine starts )	7	4
Marigold!	7	4
You want to show me around?	7	4
- ( Sighs ) - ( tools whirring, banging )	7	4
Hey, it's Don.	7	4
Look at that, I got you.	7	4
I didn't know where you'd be.	7	4
You're here, there, everywhere.	7	4
No, I'm not in the bag. I'm in the office.	7	4
Listen, let's go to Shea.	7	4
Let's go see a game, I mean it.	7	4
Is there a game today?	7	4
You shouldn't have told me that, because now we're really going.	7	4
Okay. Your wish is my command. I will not move.	7	4
Can I hang up the phone?	7	4
( Chuckles )	7	4
( groans )	7	4
When you're done with that, one of us should find some firewood.	7	4
When he's done with that, he's not going to be able	7	4
to find his ass with both hands.	7	4
I'll tell you what, Clay, why don't we switch jobs?	7	4
You want to get firewood, help yourself.	7	4
There's no hierarchy, man.	7	4
Believe me, there's always a hierarchy.	7	4
We do things by true consensus here.	7	4
If we can't all agree on something, we think of something else.	7	4
Everyone does what they want.	7	4
Good.	7	4
Because I haven't felt this at one with nature	7	4
since I was in the Navy.	7	4
Go ahead. It's dynamite grass.	7	4
Now, I see why we're eating so early.	7	4
No, it's because we follow the cycles of the Earth.	7	4
It's gonna get dark.	7	4
Electricity and all that?	7	4
It just brings problems.	7	4
But you've got a truck.	7	4
Yeah.	7	4
That's been up for debate, man.	7	4
Doesn't it get cold up here?	7	4
We light a campfire.	7	4
And there's other ways to keep warm.	7	4
It's all right, sweetheart. He's expecting me.	7	4
Freddy, what a pleasant surprise.	7	4
- You know you called me. - I sure do.	7	4
- There's someone I want you to meet. - Who?	7	4
I want you to... ♪ Meet the Mets ♪	7	4
Meet the Mets!	7	4
♪ Step right up and greet the Mets. ♪	7	4
Great idea. Can you walk?	7	4
Hello again.	7	4
Meredith, we're off for the day.	7	4
- Way off. - Okay. You two have fun.	7	4
Where are you going?	7	4
( Tools buzzing )	7	4
Don, I didn't hear you.	7	4
No, I didn't hear you.	7	4
Come on, Don, we're gonna miss the game.	7	4
You talk like a friend, but you're not.	7	4
I'm sorry, I don't understand.	7	4
I know your name.	7	4
It's Lloyd. I told you.	7	4
No, you go by many names.	7	4
I know who you are.	7	4
Don, let's go.	7	4
Why don't you listen to your friend?	7	4
You don't need a campaign.	7	4
You've had the best campaign since the dawn of time.	7	4
Pull yourself together.	7	4
Freddy?	7	4
We're knocking off early.	7	4
- Okay. - Ball game.	7	4
I just wanted to make sure you saw the memo from the partners.	7	4
Your raise was approved. Congratulations.	7	4
What?	7	4
Oh, yes. Thank you. This office is so great.	7	4
Everyone can just drop by on their way out.	7	4
Don't worry, it won't happen again.	7	4
Joan!	7	4
I'm sorry. I'm just having a day.	7	4
I have exactly two minutes.	7	4
It won't take that long.	7	4
You already know the problem.	7	4
Burger Chef's a big account,	7	4
but they obviously thought you were ready for it.	7	4
They didn't want to give me Burger Chef.	7	4
- They wanted to give me Don. - What are you talking about?	7	4
You didn't hear?	7	4
Lou put Don on my team.	7	4
- To cowardice. - Mine or theirs?	7	4
He owes me work, and he's going to the ball game?	7	4
And there's nothing I can do, and he knows that.	7	4
Have you told Lou?	7	4
You don't know this, but there were rules set for Don.	7	4
- Is he breaking them? - I don't know.	7	4
( Sighs )	7	4
So, they just dropped it in my lap,	7	4
hoping one of us would fail.	7	4
Well, Peggy, I don't know if this makes you feel better,	7	4
but I don't think they thought about it at all.	7	4
"Roger: I can't believe my little ""princess and the pea"""	7	4
is sleeping like this.	7	4
You've never even wanted to go camping.	7	4
Margaret: Well...	7	4
I used to think the country was lonely.	7	4
Now I realize the city is.	7	4
I mean, look at that.	7	4
It's beautiful.	7	4
You think we'll put a man up there?	7	4
With all the brainpower around here?	7	4
I'm certain you'll put a man on the roof.	7	4
I'd like to go to the moon.	7	4
Well, I guess if you can make an allowance for a truck,	7	4
you can make an allowance for a rocket.	7	4
Don't you want to go?	7	4
Of course.	7	4
Every little boy wants to be an astronaut.	7	4
Astronauts didn't exist when you were a little boy.	7	4
Jules Verne--	7	4
"""From the Earth to the Moon."""	7	4
You read that to me.	7	4
They shot a cannon into space.	7	4
I don't think so.	7	4
Must've been your mother.	7	4
I'm really happy here, Daddy.	7	4
I know.	7	4
Oop, oop...	7	4
Get my binoculars. They're in the hallway closet.	7	4
Good idea.	7	4
We're going to miss the national anthem.	7	4
( Door closes )	7	4
( Margaret giggling ) Stop it, not here.	7	4
( Car horn honks )	7	4
Come on.	7	4
It's as black and strong as Jack Johnson.	7	4
Thank you.	7	4
How'd you get in?	7	4
I'm glad you passed out. I got a lot less to explain.	7	4
Did the Mets win?	7	4
What the hell are you doing?	7	4
Aren't they giving you a second chance?	7	4
They weren't serious about it.	7	4
They finally gave me something to do,	7	4
and it was write 25 tags for Peggy.	7	4
- What's the account? - Burger Chef.	7	4
Hm-- Peggy.	7	4
Have you been to the restaurant yet?	7	4
What, and have some pimply kid who should be writing taglines	7	4
hand me a milk shake?	7	4
How would you rather have it?	7	4
Would you rather be in my situation--	7	4
bouncing from office to office?	7	4
"""Ding-dong, Don Draper calling."""	7	4
I want my job back.	7	4
How the hell do you think that's going to happen	7	4
when you're at the bottom of a bottle?	7	4
You know you never have to have another drink again.	7	4
I don't want to hear that right now.	7	4
You're hungover. It's the best time to hear it.	7	4
I mean, are you just going to kill yourself?	7	4
Give them what they want?	7	4
Or go in your bedroom, get in uniform,	7	4
fix your bayonet, and hit the parade?	7	4
Do the work, Don.	7	4
- ( Birds Chirping) - ( Sighs)	7	4
You're up early.	7	4
Where's my daughter?	7	4
She's probably at the creek getting water.	7	4
I don't think so.	7	4
It's a beautiful night and a beautiful morning.	7	4
Did you see the sunrise?	7	4
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?	7	4
It's time to leave Shangri-La, baby.	7	4
Take a good look, say good-bye to your friends.	7	4
You were doing so well, Daddy.	7	4
Fine, you don't want to say good-bye?	7	4
- Let's go. - Hey, man, leave her be.	7	4
Come on, Sprout, you feel like driving the truck today?	7	4
No one's going to help you take me away from here.	7	4
They know this is where I want to be.	7	4
I don't care what you want and I don't care what they want.	7	4
It's over. Let's go.	7	4
I don't know why I assumed you were more open-minded.	7	4
Well, I'm not.	7	4
I understand the temptation,	7	4
and I know everyone your age is running away	7	4
and screwing around, but you can't.	7	4
You're a mother.	7	4
- Ellery has everything he needs. - He needs his mother.	7	4
I'm sorry, but you don't get to do this!	7	4
Good-bye, Daddy.	7	4
Let me go! Let me go right now!	7	4
(grunts)	7	4
How could you just leave him?	7	4
He's your baby.	7	4
How did you feel when you went away to work, Daddy?	7	4
Your conscience must have been eating you alive.	7	4
Calling your secretary from a hotel	7	4
to pick out a birthday present for me?	7	4
I'm sure you were sick.	7	4
It's not that hard, Daddy.	7	4
He'll be fine.	7	4
( Elevator bell dings )	7	4
You sure you don't want a Danish?	7	4
Nope.	7	4
- Coffee? - Yes, please.	7	4
Good morning.	7	4
I'll have your tags by lunch.	7	4
Great.	7	4

Good morning.	7	5
Plans for the weekend?	7	5
- California? - Next weekend.	7	5
I want you to know I haven't forgotten	7	5
your request regarding Handi-Wrap.	7	5
I spoke to Lou and he's very happy to have you on the business.	7	5
And, of course, you can assume from our conversation that I am, too.	7	5
Thank you.	7	5
I hope you understand I mean on the team.	7	5
That's exactly what I asked for.	7	5
 Stop humming! You're not happy!	7	5
Do you want me to introduce you?	7	5
I'm not interested in her.	7	5
She belongs to it and it belongs to her.	7	5
"- What is ""it""? - What, am I Cassandra?"	7	5
That machine came for us. And one by one...	7	5
- Good morning. - Morning.	7	5
Morning, lovely.	7	5
What's wrong?	7	5
Do you know anything about this?	7	5
Where did you get this?	7	5
I found it on the Xerox machine.	7	5
"And I thought, ""Wow, Shirley's gonna be"	7	5
"in a lot of trouble for leaving it there."""	7	5
 - It's sensational stuff. - I didn't leave it there.	7	5
But I appreciate its return.	7	5
It's got to be pretty recent.	7	5
He's got one about Eisenhower's funeral.	7	5
I'm sure he'd prefer you hadn't seen this.	7	5
Hmm, that's not what Dr. Freud would say.	7	5
No one has seen this.	7	5
"""Scout's Honor."""	7	5
Mr. Ginsberg?	7	5
This thing's on the fritz.	7	5
S-T-R-A-T-E-G-Y.	7	5
Meredith, honey, I don't want that spelled out,	7	5
l just want it spelled right.	7	5
Mr. Draper.	7	5
I was just talking to you.	7	5
There's a Stephanie Horton calling collect.	7	5
Would you like to accept the charges?	7	5
She says she's your niece.	7	5
Yes. Yes, absolutely.	7	5
Hello, Stephanie. It's Don.	7	5
I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.	7	5
Come on. How are you?	7	5
How are you... Don?	7	5
About the same.	7	5
Is everything okay?	7	5
Well...	7	5
I suppose it probably sounds like an emergency, but it's not.	7	5
I thought of you because, well--	7	5
it's not an emergency.	7	5
You're making it sound like an emergency, sweetheart.	7	5
I'm pregnant.	7	5
I'm expecting.	7	5
And I'm running out of bread and...	7	5
I hate that this is why I'm talking to you after all this time.	7	5
I'm glad you called me.	7	5
That's what I'm here for.	7	5
I mean, you're my...	7	5
What'd you call yourself? My niece.	7	5
I don't know why I said that.	7	5
No, that's what you are.	7	5
I like that.	7	5
Are you still in Berkeley?	7	5
I'm in LA. That's where I ended up.	7	5
It's gonna be fine. Do you have a pen?	7	5
How far along are you?	7	5
I think around seven months.	7	5
But my mom says I came early.	7	5
My wife, her name is Megan Draper, lives in LA.	7	5
Can you get to Laurel Canyon?	7	5
I've got a car. You got married again?	7	5
Yes.	7	5
She's gonna take care of you.	7	5
I want you to stay there. I'm coming out tonight.	7	5
I don't know.	7	5
I want to see you. It's not up for debate.	7	5
Thank you, Dick.	7	5
You may find the time by dialing	7	5
Meridian 7-1-2-1-2.	7	5
I'm sorry, can I speak to Megan, please?	7	5
- Hello. - Listen, I'm coming out tonight.	7	5
Oh, okay. ls everything okay?	7	5
Not really.	7	5
You're gonna get a visit from Stephanie Horton.	7	5
She's Anna Draper's niece.	7	5
She's expecting and she's alone	7	5
and she needs money and I should see her.	7	5
Poor thing.	7	5
I'll cancel my party and you can catch up.	7	5
What Pam?	7	5
You said you weren't coming this weekend,	7	5
so I'm having the party for my acting class.	7	5
- Tonight? - Tomorrow night.	7	5
But I don't need to have it.	7	5
Or you can come. Stephanie can come.	7	5
Don't worry about it. We'll stay out of your way.	7	5
You don't have to pick me up. I'll be in by 10:00.	7	5
I'm so sorry, Don. We'll make her feel at home.	7	5
Who's there with you?	7	5
Amy from Delaware.	7	5
Could you get rid of her? I'd rather keep this a family matter.	7	5
Okay.	7	5
I'm sorry this is the reason, but I'm glad I get to see you.	7	5
Me, too. Bye.	7	5
Ooh.	7	5
Burger Chef's mascot Little Chef is a flop	7	5
because he's, what, another chef?	7	5
He doesn't eat the burgers, he cooks them.	7	5
But what if you replaced him with a fresh recruit?	7	5
A saucy little retard named Scout.	7	5
He can't work at a hamburger stand.	7	5
He can take anything but an order.	7	5
Hey, Don.	7	5
Stan, once the smoke clears,	7	5
I need you to rush some things out for Handi-Wrap.	7	5
- I need it by 4:00. - Mmm.	7	5
I'm really, truly busy.	7	5
What the hell is that?	7	5
Turns out Lou thinks he's Mort Drucker.	7	5
- Mort Walker. - How'd you get this?	7	5
It wasn't our fault. Why is Scout always up to no good?	7	5
He peeled a bag of grapefruits.	7	5
Thought they were potatoes.	7	5
I'm gonna get rid of this.	7	5
He left it on the Xerox. He obviously wanted us to have a copy.	7	5
You're just gonna force me to draw my own.	7	5
I've got a plane to catch. Get to work.	7	5
Don's still part of the faculty.	7	5
Naw, he's gonna stroke to 'em later.	7	5
Why don't you let Loretta do that?	7	5
She can handle the homework. I'll handle the silver.	7	5
What'd you land on?	7	5
Rumaki, Crab Louie on toast points,	7	5
and little franks in barbecue sauce.	7	5
You know they've got four more houses to visit after us?	7	5
I wanted to go first to put everyone at ease.	7	5
They get so tongue-tied around us.	7	5
They can only pretend so long we're just regular neighbors.	7	5
Could you stock the bar?	7	5
Hi. Did you have any trouble finding us?	7	5
No.	7	5
I'm Megan, by the way.	7	5
I'm Stephanie.	7	5
You are so beautiful.	7	5
I know, I'm a Madonna.	7	5
But you are truly magnetic.	7	5
What do you do?	7	5
Don didn't tell you? I'm an actress.	7	5
Uh, welcome.	7	5
I'm grateful.	7	5
For some reason, I'm not crying, man.	7	5
Well, why don't I fix you something to eat	7	5
and then you can take a shower if you want?	7	5
- Is it that bad? - No!	7	5
I don't know.	7	5
I think you'd want to relax.	7	5
Don didn't say much about your situation other than the obvious.	7	5
Your place is out of sight.	7	5
I'm at a flop in MacArthur Park,	7	5
but I'm headed up to Oakland with a little help.	7	5
I have some friends there and one of them's old man's a doctor.	7	5
So, assume it's no trouble at all.	7	5
What's your pleasure? Grilled cheese? Spaghetti?	7	5
Do you have any meat? I've been dreaming about it.	7	5
Sure.	7	5
Now you go into the bedroom back there.	7	5
I changed the sheets. There are towels.	7	5
You can lie down, run a bath, whatever you want.	7	5
Make yourself at home.	7	5
Thank you. I'm pretty beat.	7	5
You know I want her.	7	5
You can't have her.	7	5
Why can't I have her?	7	5
Because Scout's on 'er.	7	5
Nice of you to join us.	7	5
Don, why don't you take the mound, throw out the first pitch?	7	5
Sure.	7	5
Stan has some very preliminary work.	7	5
Stan?	7	5
Should I move over there or do you want to come over here?	7	5
I don't know, Stan. Can you be smug from over there?	7	5
Lou, I don't know what you think you heard.	7	5
I heard everything!	7	5
From your first fart to your last dying breath.	7	5
You think it's funny?	7	5
I apologize deeply.	7	5
What happened?	7	5
Let me ask you, Peggy.	7	5
- You ever heard of Underdog? - The cartoon?	7	5
Yeah. Sweet Polly Purebred.	7	5
Saturday morning.	7	5
It makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.	7	5
Mostly for its creator Chet Stover of Dancer Fitzgerald.	7	5
- Did you know him there? - He was nothing special.	7	5
"""Scout's Honor"" is 100 times better."	7	5
I can tell you right now, it's a winner.	7	5
You know who had a ridiculous dream and people laughed at him?	7	5
You?	7	5
What?	7	5
Oh, I did not mean that the way it sounded.	7	5
I mean, if you're telling us that this is your dream,	7	5
I apologize for being one of those naysaying idiots.	7	5
I hate people like that.	7	5
Bob Dylan.	7	5
Is he hip enough for you?	7	5
"He was 20 years old when he wrote ""Blowin' in the Wind"""	7	5
and he's a genius.	7	5
Look at where he is, look at where you are.	7	5
You know what?	7	5
You're a bunch of flag-burning snots.	7	5
You've got a thing to learn about patriotism and loyalty.	7	5
"The very fabric of ""Scout's Honor"" is a joke to you."	7	5
We're gonna have this meeting later.	7	5
So order dinner because I want finished work.	7	5
And if any of you don't like it,	7	5
you can thank your hilarious friends here.	7	5
Last flight's at 9:00. Put me on that.	7	5
- I'll cancel my plans. - Just mine, not yours.	7	5
I don't know if it's vandals or just kids being kids.	7	5
What is it?	7	5
Someone broke all the streetlights on Peck Avenue.	7	5
And you want Henry to get them fixed?	7	5
No. Mike was just saying it's a national disease.	7	5
The wildness of the kids.	7	5
I just don't expect it in Westchester.	7	5
I know all everyone wants to talk about is Vietnam,	7	5
but things are falling apart here, too.	7	5
The rumaki is exquisite.	7	5
Thank you.	7	5
Well, I don't know that those things are unrelated.	7	5
I mean, first the kids start off protesting	7	5
and the next thing you know every authority is up for grabs.	7	5
I mean, if they learned how to support their country,	7	5
sacrifice in hard times, we'd have the morale to win the war.	7	5
Mike, you have plans for summer?	7	5
Even Nixon wants to bring the war to an end.	7	5
I'm surprised, Henry.	7	5
Don't be, Mike. I agree with Nixon.	7	5
I think it's too costly.	7	5
It has to be clone on the right terms,	7	5
but I think we should get out while the getting's good.	7	5
Since when?	7	5
I've always supported the president, honey.	7	5
I think that maybe everyone should fill up here.	7	5
I don't know if my lamb turned out.	7	5
I'm sure it's delicious.	7	5
Let me check the Sterno.	7	5
Well, I think I worked every side of the strategy.	7	5
Don, you've been the boss.	7	5
The briefcase and the hat, that's a rookie maneuver.	7	5
You got someplace to be?	7	5
I'm afraid I do.	7	5
How's it going to look for them if I let you go?	7	5
Well, you could let everybody go.	7	5
Is that what you would do?	7	5
No, I'd let you go, Lou.	7	5
Well, I'm afraid it's too late for that.	7	5
I'm gonna do you the courtesy of reading these	7	5
so that you can continue to work on them instead of coming up with new things,	7	5
because I'm gonna tuck you in tonight.	7	5
About your cartoon.	7	5
Here we go.	7	5
This is an office made out of people who have problems with authority.	7	5
You know you have to have a thick skin, but don't help them.	7	5
I'm not taking management advice from Don Draper.	7	5
Hello?	7	5
I can't get out of here tonight.	7	5
Oh, I'm sorry.	7	5
- Is she there yet? - She's taking a bath.	7	5
How is she?	7	5
She's pretty far along.	7	5
So beautiful.	7	5
Well, don't bother her. Tell her I'll see her in the morning.	7	5
Don't worry. I made her a steak.	7	5
Thank you.	7	5
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow morning.	7	5
Okay.	7	5
Damn, that smells good.	7	5
Don's stuck in New York. He's flying in tomorrow morning.	7	5
Was that him?	7	5
Yeah, he's frustrated. I told him not to worry.	7	5
Wait, do you want to eat outside?	7	5
I do that all the time.	7	5
I love that you're wearing Anna's ring.	7	5
Oh, yes. It's beautiful.	7	5
I'm sorry I never met her.	7	5
She's around. Believe me, you've met her.	7	5
She's happy it's in the family.	7	5
Well, maybe you'll have someone there to give it to.	7	5
Oh, no. It's yours now.	7	5
You'll probably have someone of your own.	7	5
We'll see. I don't know.	7	5
Don's kids are plenty for me.	7	5
I haven't eaten meat in a year.	7	5
I don't think this is a good idea.	7	5
I can make spaghetti.	7	5
It's probably hard with you here and him there.	7	5
Are you with someone?	7	5
Not right now. He was a musician.	7	5
They're the worst.	7	5
Dropped out of school. Followed him down here.	7	5
Started flush at the beach,	7	5
ended up downtown panhandling.	7	5
And then he got busted dealing grass	7	5
and we celebrated before he went away.	7	5
He'll be out in a month.	7	5
So will this little guy.	7	5
- Does he know? - No.	7	5
I'm afraid he'd murder someone just to stay in jail.	7	5
- I won't tell Don. - Oh, I don't care.	7	5
I know all of his secrets.	7	5
But you don't know him very well.	7	5
You're right. You're right.	7	5
It's just I'm looking at you	7	5
and seeing how, well, disorganized this all is.	7	5
And I don't think he'd stand for that.	7	5
I don't think he'd trust you to make your own plans.	7	5
I don't know what I'm doing here. This was a dumb idea.	7	5
No, no, I mean, he wants to help, I'm sure, in his way.	7	5
We both do.	7	5
"I'm going to give you."""	7	5
would $1,000 get you far enough?	7	5
That's very generous.	7	5
This comes with no strings.	7	5
Thank you.	7	5
I really think it's better this way.	7	5
You're right. I'm gonna take off.	7	5
You haven't eaten anything yet.	7	5
I guess I got what I came for.	7	5
There's no rush.	7	5
Nothing ever happened between us, you know.	7	5
Of course not.	7	5
You're his niece. I know that.	7	5
The children are asleep.	7	5
- What about your headache? - Keep your voice down.	7	5
I did not appreciate going stag	7	5
to four people's homes whom I barely know.	7	5
I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling well.	7	5
You didn't have to go.	7	5
Hey, Emily Post, why were you talking about the war?	7	5
I didn't bring it up.	7	5
But maybe I should more because I didn't know where you stood.	7	5
I shouldn't have to brief you	7	5
because you shouldn't be talking about those things.	7	5
I'm not a dinner companion. I'm their elected representative.	7	5
- You ran unopposed. - We'll see if that lasts.	7	5
From now on, keep your conversation to how much you hate	7	5
getting toast crumbs in the butter and leave the thinking to me!	7	5
Henry!	7	5
I'm sorry. It just caught me off-guard.	7	5
Well, you embarrassed yourself way more than me.	7	5
You know what?	7	5
I decided I can see that Monday.	7	5
Good night.	7	5
Hello?	7	5
What?	7	5
ls she okay?	7	5
Hello?	7	5
Oh, hi.	7	5
- Who are you? - I'm Amy.	7	5
- We met on the phone. - ls Megan here?	7	5
Oh, Don. I...	7	5
Amy, do you mind?	7	5
I'll just use the ladies'.	7	5
I'm sorry, but she left.	7	5
You told her I wanted to see her?	7	5
I really tried to get her to stay.	7	5
But the money already came up and I gave her $1,000.	7	5
She must have been embarrassed.	7	5
She said she'd call you from Oakland.	7	5
You should have called me. At least let me talk to her.	7	5
She's an adult, Don.	7	5
Do you want to go to the market with us?	7	5
You know, I'm gonna have company tonight.	7	5
Maybe it'll cheer you up.	7	5
We'll go. Amy.	7	5
- Is everything okay? - Yes.	7	5
- We should go. - Anything for you, Don?	7	5
I know what he likes.	7	5
Ahem.	7	5
We're back.	7	5
- Let me see. - She's fine.	7	5
Couple of black eyes.	7	5
Ow. Can I go lie down?	7	5
I want to know what really happened.	7	5
They were sword fighting with golf clubs.	7	5
- We're idiots, okay? - You are.	7	5
You can't be trusted on your own. That's your face, young lady.	7	5
That's right, it's my face.	7	5
- Why am I even here? - Girls! Girls! Please.	7	5
Sally, you can understand	7	5
how your mother and I are both worried about your nose.	7	5
Yeah, I know, because where would Mom be without her perfect nose?	7	5
She wouldn't find a man like you.	7	5
She'd be nothing.	7	5
It was a perfect nose.	7	5
And I gave it to you!	7	5
You're lucky Henry is important enough	7	5
to get Dr. Kramer to fix it this weekend.	7	5
I suppose you'd rather do it in a barn in Farmington.	7	5
It's a nose job, not an abortion.	7	5
- I'm going to break your arm next. - Betty!	7	5
Don't worry about me finding a man.	7	5
I already have you to keep me in line.	7	5
You're going to your room and you're going to wait there until morning.	7	5
Good, I prefer it.	7	5
Hello?	7	5
Just a minute.	7	5
It's for Megan again.	7	5
Megan?	7	5
It's Green Matt's.	7	5
Hello.	7	5
The main door was open and you didn't check the peephole?	7	5
It's a bad neighborhood.	7	5
What are you doing here?	7	5
I wanted to tell you--	7	5
May I?	7	5
Michael.	7	5
I was just in the office and there's something going on.	7	5
- What? - The computer.	7	5
It's Saturday. Take the day off.	7	5
That's right, so why were Lou and Cutler	7	5
having a secret meeting in that air-conditioned lair?	7	5
- I don't know. - But I do.	7	5
They're homos.	7	5
Okay.	7	5
Anything else to report?	7	5
Peggy, it's serious.	7	5
That machine makes men do unnatural things.	7	5
What did you see?	7	5
- Who are you? -This is Julio.	7	5
- Hello. - Hey.	7	5
I'd like to say Peggy's mentioned you at work, but she hasn't.	7	5
Julio lives upstairs.	7	5
Interesting arrangement. Very modern.	7	5
I live with my mama.	7	5
I live with my pop, which is why I can't work at home.	7	5
Can I please work here? I can't go back to the office.	7	5
Not right now. I'll stay out of your way.	7	5
Fine.	7	5
Can I use your typewriter?	7	5
It's too loud.	7	5

I wouldn't have invited them both if I had known.	7	5
I swear, I thought she was his daughter.	7	5
Don't you kind of want to see what happens?	7	5
I'm doing fine.	7	5
I don't think you are doing fine.	7	5
Maybe I'm not in the mood.	7	5
Oh, sorry.	7	5
This is why I never invite musicians.	7	5

Don. Megan.	7	5
I'm sorry.	7	5
Miranda here invited me to a party. I didn't know this was it.	7	5
Hi, Miranda.	7	5
This place is out of sight.	7	5
I've been trying to help Miranda find an agent.	7	5
You're so helpful.	7	5
Harry, what do you say we go get a drink?	7	5
- Do you mind? - No, of course not.	7	5
As long as Harry drives.	7	5
Well, I- we--	7	5
should I bring Miranda along?	7	5
Do you want to?	7	5
Sorry, honey.	7	5
We'll get you a ride.	7	5
She better not catch you in here.	7	5
But then I'm not gonna get to see you.	7	5
That's the way Betty likes it.	7	5
Are they gonna get divorced?	7	5
What? No.	7	5
They're the Dynamic Duo.	7	5
That's never going to happen.	7	5
The other night, they were really screaming at each other.	7	5
I saw Henry take a pillow to the den.	7	5
I'm gonna hitch back to school tonight.	7	5
Can I come with you?	7	5
You want to run away?	7	5
I have a stomach ache all the time.	7	5
You're not gonna piss, are you?	7	5
I don't do that anymore.	7	5
I'm sorry.	7	5
They'll never let you out.	7	5
You're too little.	7	5
- Michael. - I'm sorry.	7	5
The kid left an hour ago.	7	5
It's interesting because first you were dead,	7	5
then all this activity started in your eyelids.	7	5
Time to go.	7	5
There's this pressure in my head	7	5
like there's a hydrogen bomb that's gonna go off.	7	5
And then I realize it's that hum in the office.	7	5
It's getting to me.	7	5
I caught myself looking at Stan's shoulders	7	5
and getting, you know, excited.	7	5
- Really? - That's the computer's plan.	7	5
Turn us all homo.	7	5
Peggy, we got to reproduce.	7	5
If there was a way to do it without having sex, I'd do it.	7	5
Stop it!	7	5
You have to leave.	7	5
Great. What am I doing? It's building up.	7	5
Well, maybe you should see a doctor or something.	7	5
Why? 'Cause I want you?	7	5
No, because you're not right.	7	5
Did you notice the radio doesn't work in there anymore?	7	5
That's not my imagination.	7	5
It's just a computer!	7	5
No, you're right.	7	5
I'm gonna go.	7	5
You don't have to report this information.	7	5

Good. 'Cause I was happy to see you.	7	5
You know what, Don? lam put in a strange position.	7	5
But I want you to know I respect you.	7	5
Agencies change.	7	5
For the better, maybe.	7	5
But guys like us, we've got to look out for each other.	7	5
I'm not gonna tell your wife.	7	5
That's not what I meant.	7	5
You wouldn't do that.	7	5
We go back along way, don't we?	7	5
We do.	7	5
Well, I'm going to make sure	7	5
that you're still important.	7	5
I don't know how. It's gonna take some thought.	7	5
It's going to take some major brain power.	7	5
In fact, you might have to figure it out.	7	5
I think the solution here is not to get rid of you.	7	5
You should be in LA.	7	5
Your wife's out here. Ted Chaough is useless.	7	5
Use-less.	7	5
Ted Chaough. Broken man.	7	5
What solution?	7	5
Oh, this is the final solution.	7	5
Cutler and Lou are pursuing Commander.	7	5
- Commander who? - No, Commander cigarettes.	7	5
Philip Morris.	7	5
I think they're pretty sure that they can land it	7	5
and you'll have to go.	7	5
How long has this been going on? ls there work?	7	5
Don't make me sorry I told you.	7	5
I hope you know how much I appreciate this.	7	5
So far, just phone calls.	7	5
But I turned in the media plan yesterday.	7	5

Not everybody.	7	5

Drugs.	7	5
I'm tired.	7	5
But you just got here.	7	5
I'm going to bed.	7	5
There goes the fun.	7	5
I'm supposed to tuck you in.	7	5
And what does your friend say?	7	5
I don't want you to be in a bad mood.	7	5
Stop playing around. You're stoned.	7	5
Don't you like Amy?	7	5
Leave him alone.	7	5
This is the best place to be right now, Don.	7	5
Right here.	7	5
Kiss her. I know you want to.	7	5
I don't want anything right now.	7	5
Don't lie.	7	5
- Hey. - I can't find the coffee.	7	5
I'll get it.	7	5
Good morning.	7	5
Hello?	7	5
Oh, yes, hi. He made it.	7	5
It's Stephanie.	7	5
Oh.	7	5
Where are you?	7	5
I'm back in Oakland.	7	5
I felt bad about missing you, but I didn't want to break my word.	7	5
You did. You told me you were gonna be here.	7	5
I know, but I kind of promised Anna I'd let you live your life.	7	5
That is not what she meant.	7	5
Like it or not, I'm worried about you.	7	5
I want you to call me when the baby comes.	7	5
I want to take care of anything you need.	7	5
I'm so grateful.	7	5
And that Megan's really solid.	7	5
Thank her for me again.	7	5
You have my number.	7	5
Bye-bye.	7	5
- I'm sorry. - She sounds okay.	7	5
I have to get back.	7	5
Harry told me some things I shouldn't have been told.	7	5
- What is wrong with him? - No, I'm glad.	7	5
But I have to get back.	7	5
Really?	7	5
But you're still coming back next weekend, right?	7	5
Of course.	7	5
Hello, everyone.	7	5
Bye, everyone.	7	5

I'm comfortable here right now.	7	5
I just drove to White Plains and back up to Farmington.	7	5
I don't want to sit in the kitchen like the help.	7	5
"""The help""?"	7	5
I'm going to assume you're not referring to me.	7	5
What's gotten into you?	7	5
You come in and ask me to move just because you feel like moving.	7	5
I'm comfortable in here or I wouldn't be sitting in here!	7	5
Knock it off.	7	5
I'm tired of everyone telling me to shut up.	7	5
I'm not stupid.	7	5
I speak Italian.	7	5
I'm sorry I embarrassed you.	7	5
You're sorry you forgot to inform me what I am supposed to think.	7	5
Guess what. I think all by myself.	7	5
You're so smart. Why don't you run for office?	7	5
You know what, Henry?	7	5
I don't know what I'm going to do, but that's a good idea.	7	5
Good morning, Michael.	7	5
How are you?	7	5
Can't you tell? I'm myself again.	7	5
Oh, good. Glad to hear that.	7	5
But I do want to say in the clearness of day,	7	5
I have feelings for you.	7	5
Well, I'm flattered.	7	5
And that happens when you work with people,	7	5
but it's not real.	7	5
I realized it was the waves of data.	7	5
They were filling me up. I had to find the release.	7	5
I removed the pressure.	7	5
Now it just flows through me without affecting me at all.	7	5
It has an outlet. Open it.	7	5
You don't have to thank me for that.	7	5
It's obviously something you did on your own.	7	5
What is that?	7	5
It's my nipple. It's the valve.	7	5
It's weird-- they'll sew it up, but they won't take it off.	7	5
I had to do that myself.	7	5
Anyway, I'm grateful, so I wanted to show it.	7	5
Michael, sit down.	7	5
I want you to wait here.	7	5
Did Mr. Ginsberg find you?	7	5
"""Savoy"" playing"	7	5
Jim, Lou. Sorry to interrupt.	7	5
You must be Les. Don Draper.	7	5
Don.	7	5
This is Stephen and Tony.	7	5
We weren't expecting you, Don.	7	5
I know that and I apologize.	7	5
I just wanted to say something that I think	7	5
these gentlemen from Philip Morris are too polite to say.	7	5
We know who you are	7	5
and we're only talking about a presentation right now.	7	5
But we do have a problem working with the man	7	5
"who cut our throat in ""The New York Times."""	7	5
Well, if you were to give us a shot,	7	5
I'm prepared to leave the agency.	7	5
Don, thanks for saying that so that we don't have to.	7	5
Just know the man that wrote that letter	7	5
was trying to save his business, not destroy yours.	7	5
Like Lou, I have over 10 years of tobacco experience.	7	5
Since my first day on Lucky Strike,	7	5
the government was building a scaffold	7	5
for your whole industry.	7	5
And I found a way to stay that execution	7	5
in '60, '62, '64, and '65.	7	5
I'm also the only cigarette man who sat down with the opposition.	7	5
They shared their strategy with me	7	5
and I know how to beat it.	7	5
That may be true,	7	5
but we don't turn on our friends as easily as you do.	7	5
I just keep thinking what your friends	7	5
at American Tobacco would think if you made me apologize.	7	5
Force me into your service.	7	5
They are still your competition, aren't they?	7	5
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.	7	5
Get out while you can!	7	5
I'm gonna ride down with him.	7	5
You're incredible.	7	5
Thank you.	7	5
You think this is going to save you, don't you?	7	5

I'm sorry to bother you,	7	6
but we're the people who paid for your meal,	7	6
and as much as I am committed to you enjoying your food	7	6
while it's still piping hot,	7	6
I do have a few more questions, if you don't mind.	7	6
I'll give you the $3.10 back.	7	6
I have to beat my husband home.	7	6
Would your husband be happy if you were late,	7	6
but had another $10?	7	6
Well, I guess it would help.	7	6
 Good evening, ma'am. What's your name, little girl?	7	6
It's Stacy. ls that your question?	7	6
Would you say that you eat here weekly, monthly?	7	6
Too much.	7	6
What's your favorite thing about Burger Chef?	7	6
The taste or the price?	7	6
It's near my house.	7	6
Convenience.	7	6
Usually.	7	6
Does your husband ever pick it up?	7	6
Oh, he wouldn't do that.	7	6
It's bad enough that I'm not making dinner.	7	6
Is that all?	7	6
Come back soon.	7	6
 How much money do you have?	7	6
Two more families and Chinese for us.	7	6
It's not a listing. It's Sybil's apartment.	7	6
I'm not squatting.	7	6
I can afford a hotel.	7	6
It's seven nights.	7	6
I'm not paying for it, Bonita.	7	6
Let me at least pay for the theater tickets.	7	6
I get them for free.	7	6
Well, I'm going to buy you a pair of loafers on Fifth Avenue.	7	6
I want you shopping all day...	7	6
and screwing all night.	7	6
You'll spend the weekend with me, won't you?	7	6
I will need to spend some of Saturday afternoon in Cos Cob.	7	6
Well, I'll come.	7	6
Why would you want to do that?	7	6
I sure would like to meet Tammy.	7	6
I picked out her Barbie.	7	6
I don't want to confuse her, baby.	7	6
She's probably more confused	7	6
that her parents aren't actually divorced.	7	6
So that's something that bothers you.	7	6
Of course it bothers me.	7	6
I don't know where this is going,	7	6
but I don't want it to fail on account of delay.	7	6
I haven't seen her in a while.	7	6
Next time... I promise.	7	6
I thought you were never going to get married again.	7	6
Meet me in the restroom in 60 seconds.	7	6
I've always wanted to do that.	7	6
- Aren't you going to eat? - I'll have a roll at the office.	7	6
Well, you're disappearing.	7	6
Every time you say something like that, I go off my diet.	7	6
Go outdoors today, please.	7	6
I hope I'm not interrupting. It's Bonnie.	7	6
I remember you.	7	6
You can't just walk in here.	7	6
Bonnie, this is Meredith.	7	6
Do you want me to come and get you in five minutes?	7	6
Meredith, that'll be all.	7	6
Pete's having quite a homecoming, so I thought I'd duck in.	7	6
You're the only one I know here.	7	6
How long are you in town?	7	6
I hate to say it, but I knew where to find you.	7	6
- Don, how are you? - Good to see you.	7	6
I like what you've done with the place.	7	6
I heard you have quite the home.	7	6
Pete says it's 2,000 square feet.	7	6
Not quite.	7	6
Peggy's going to be leading us through the work, as it were.	7	6
I assume you're attending.	7	6
- Burger Chef? - You're on the team.	7	6
I'd like you to be there.	7	6
- I guess this is my cue. - Baloney.	7	6
Walk me to the conference room.	7	6
He wants to make sure everyone's seen you.	7	6
- Ta-ta. - Very well.	7	6
ls this the billboard?	7	6
It's kind of lackluster.	7	6
That's the tray liner.	7	6
- That's everything, chief. - Thank you, Stan.	7	6
- Hello, Stan. - Good to see you, Pete.	7	6
How's life treating you?	7	6
I'm in New York and I'm in love.	7	6
Me as well.	7	6
Hello, Pete.	7	6
Well, I think we should get this started.	7	6
Did you need something, Don?	7	6
I've asked Don to join us.	7	6
I didn't know you wanted the team. Should we get Mathis as well?	7	6
No, Don's plenty.	7	6
Well, he has been instrumental.	7	6
I think we're circling a strategy--	7	6
all the research points to the fact that mothers feel guilty.	7	6
They don't eat at the restaurant	7	6
"because of what Mathis calls a ""cleanliness fetish."""	7	6
And even when they get home, they're embarrassed.	7	6
Our job is to turn Burger Chef into a special treat served with love.	7	6
So the more these women go to Burger Chef,	7	6
- the worse they feel. - Yes.	7	6
We need to address how to give homemakers permission.	7	6
Well, who gives moms permission?	7	6
Dads.	7	6
It's a dark night.	7	6
Reveal our morn, driving, girl in a tutu next to her,	7	6
boy wearing a football helmet in the back.	7	6
Push into a close-up as we hear Mom's voice--	7	6
the things on her mind.	7	6
"""Let's see, check that list for the marching band fundraiser."	7	6
Get the sink trap checked.	7	6
Get Jim to take down the storm windows.	7	6
Jim!	7	6
"Jim will be home in a half an hour."""	7	6
"Just then the little girl says, ""I'm hungry."""	7	6
"The boy says, ""I'm starving."""	7	6
"Mom says, ""One more stop."""	7	6
We see the reflection of the Burger Chef sign	7	6
on the station wagon windshield as she pulls in.	7	6
Mom gets out of the car.	7	6
A handsome man comes out holding a bag.	7	6
Mom walks up to him and gives him a deep kiss.	7	6
The kids in the car looking surprised.	7	6
"He laughs and says, ""Can I take you to dinner?"""	7	6
"She says, ""Next time, let me get dinner."	7	6
"You take down the storm windows."""	7	6
Cut to them at the kitchen table,	7	6
camera moving from face to smiling face.	7	6
They're laughing, Mom looks around, smiling.	7	6
"""Aren't you glad"	7	6
"everybody loves Burger Chef as much as you do?"""	7	6
Very nice. I think it's coming along.	7	6
It's nice to see family happiness again.	7	6
Thank you.	7	6
What do you think?	7	6
The dad surprising the family absolves the mom.	7	6
It's right on strategy. It's exactly what they wanted.	7	6
Don worked the tag over by the syllable.	7	6
- It's deceptively simple. - Thank you.	7	6
Why don't you take us through the legs?	7	6
Let's start with radio.	7	6
Looky here. A sight for sore eyes.	7	6
Ah...	7	6
Hello, Jim.	7	6
How's your Burger Chef work going?	7	6
Better than yours, I guess.	7	6
Thank you, by the way, for failing and giving us a shot at it.	7	6
It's not McDonald's. It's run by morons.	7	6
A lot of companies succeed that way.	7	6
But look who I'm talking to.	7	6
You don't mean that.	7	6
You're going after fast food.	7	6
You've got your little car--	7	6
it's not Buick, but it's cute.	7	6
I know you folks want to be just like McCann when you grow up.	7	6
When we grow up, we're going to kill you and marry your wife.	7	6
Listen, I hear you're talking to Philip Morris.	7	6
Is Leo Burnett in here, too?	7	6
Well, I'm just curious how you think you're going to pull that off	7	6
with Don Draper haunting your halls.	7	6
You're so lucky my problems aren't your problems.	7	6
What if I wanted them to be?	7	6
Are you looking for a job?	7	6
No. No.	7	6
I'm just looking to enrich the lives of people I respect.	7	6
The New York Athletic Club frowns on people	7	6
making advances in their steam room.	7	6
I was kidding around, but I think you're making eyes at me.	7	6
I'm gonna go get a massage, relieve some of this tension.	7	6
Fellas, we got a live one here.	7	6
Come in, join us.	7	6
I'm drinking rum.	7	6
- Do you want some? - No, thank you.	7	6
That bar, it's hysterical.	7	6
My wife's a card.	7	6
I'm very pleased with the direction I saw this morning.	7	6
- We all are. - Thank you.	7	6
And-- not but--	7	6
I think with my understanding of George Payton	7	6
that our success would be further assured	7	6
if Don delivered the presentation.	7	6
- Oh. - Here's the but.	7	6
It is completely your decision.	7	6
Why are you doing this now?	7	6
That's what I said. She's doing fine.	7	6
Lou, first of all, you've never seen Don at his best.	7	6
It'll be a tearjerker.	7	6
Number two is Peggy, in my mind, will still speak,	7	6
but as the mother.	7	6
A change of tone. You were wonderful in there.	7	6
I don't like being in this position.	7	6
I know I can bring this home.	7	6
Peggy, you didn't walk into this office and see Don here.	7	6
This is your client,	7	6
and you're going to write as much of it as you want to.	7	6
Don will give authority, you will give emotion.	7	6
I have authority. And Don has emotion.	7	6
I prefer you as an expert witness.	7	6
You will introduce him.	7	6
But it's your decision.	7	6
- What? - It's Ted.	7	6
Ted's on the phone.	7	6
Oh.	7	6
Hello.	7	6
I've seen the work so far. I'm impressed.	7	6
And what would you do?	7	6
I would use everything at my disposal to win it.	7	6
If you think George Payton will prefer it,	7	6
I'm not going to ignore that.	7	6
You know that she's every bit as good as any woman in this business!	7	6
I do.	7	6
He'll be great.	7	6
Keep up the good work.	7	6
It's big and powerful and costs a fortune,	7	6
but it can't make coffee.	7	6
They've got a computer twice that size	7	6
working on the engine for the XP.	7	6
- Clara. - Nice to see you, Mr. Benson.	7	6
Gentlemen, there's coffee and cake in Mr. Crane's office.	7	6
May I take your hats?	7	6
Hey, fellas.	7	6
Jack, Bill, nice to see you.	7	6
- Hello, Kenny. - How's the kid? ls he flying yet?	7	6
Are you kidding? He's crawling all over the place.	7	6
You've really got to keep an eye on him.	7	6
Joan! Come say hello.	7	6
Welcome back, Bob. Gentlemen.	7	6
How the hell did we end up with him instead of you?	7	6
- No one asked. - This is Bill Hartley.	7	6
Bill's been bumped to vice president of brand.	7	6
Congratulations.	7	6
You certainly picked the right place to celebrate.	7	6
You mean New York City or this very spot?	7	6
So far all we have lined up is six hours of network pilots.	7	6
Clara, could you take them to Harry's office?	7	6
- Enjoy. . Very funny.	7	6
Pleasure, ma'am.	7	6
I'd love to see you Sunday.	7	6
Unless you've made plans with some married guy.	7	6
lam all yours.	7	6
But if you want to see Kevin, you're going to have to see my mother.	7	6
I want to see everyone.	7	6
- You need something? - Yes, actually, I do.	7	6
I've given it careful thought,	7	6
and I think you should give the presentation to Burger Chef.	7	6
Hold on.	7	6
You did a great job this morning.	7	6
That's good to hear,	7	6
but I want to have the best chance of winning this,	7	6
and I'm not going to pretend you're not it.	7	6
- Whose idea was this? - Mine.	7	6
I'll introduce you, and when you're rounding third,	7	6
"you hand it off to ""the voice of moms."""	7	6
And then you turn and hit the tag like you just thought of it.	7	6
- Do I do that? - Yes, you do.	7	6
- Whatever you want. - That's what I want.	7	6
Thank you.	7	6
You know, I was just noodling around with the idea	7	6
of seeing the whole thing from the kids' perspective.	7	6
"- ""Mom, can we go to Burger Chef?"" - Excuse me?"	7	6
I don't know. Just a thought.	7	6
I appreciate it, but we already have a strategy.	7	6
Megan?	7	6
Hello!	7	6
Oh, I'm sorry.	7	6
Why didn't you say something?	7	6
No, Marsha, this is Megan, Don's wife.	7	6
I didn't know he was married.	7	6
So nice to meet you.	7	6
Marsha, can you get Megan some coffee?	7	6
I'm fine.	7	6
This is very impressive, but where do you work now?	7	6
My office is right here.	7	6
- Are you a surprise? - No, he's expecting me.	7	6
Well, you're a surprise for me.	7	6
How is everything in LA?	7	6
It's exciting and new and different.	7	6
And a lot quieter.	7	6
What a great office.	7	6
Sooner or later you're going to get Don's, aren't you?	7	6
I don't know how much better it is.	7	6
He's right next door.	7	6
Oh.	7	6
Hey!	7	6
I didn't expect to see you.	7	6
- Megan's in for a visit. - Thanks for the subtitles.	7	6
- Did you hear about Ginsberg? - Yes. Have you seen him?	7	6
I did. She won't go.	7	6
All right, Meredith, I'm gonna go.	7	6
Don.	7	6
What are you doing here?	7	6
I couldn't wait to see you.	7	6
I thought we could eat downtown.	7	6
That's a great idea.	7	6
Well, it was so great to see you both.	7	6
Is it okay? I have a visitor.	7	6
Enjoy yourself.	7	6
Good night.	7	6
I miss her.	7	6
You didn't even ask me how the dry run went.	7	6
Was there a problem?	7	6
No, they loved it.	7	6
Are you mad at me?	7	6
No. Good night, Stan.	7	6
Good night.	7	6
Ah, good, you're still here.	7	6
That's your opinion.	7	6
I played a round this morning with Les Clark-	7	6
my friend from Philip Morris?	7	6
The brand commander of Commander brand.	7	6
Your name came up and I sure would appreciate	7	6
you helping us pave that road.	7	6
Your secret plan to win the war?	7	6
Stop thinking about Don	7	6
and start thinking about the company.	7	6
Who's here for William Hartley?	7	6
- Bill? - Don't say anything.	7	6
But you should say thank you to your boyfriend	7	6
- for posting bail. - Has he seen a doctor?	7	6
- What did I just say? - Take him to a headshrinker.	7	6
He tried to fellate an undercover officer.	7	6
May I go?	7	6
Good night, ladies.	7	6
I called you because I knew you could keep this to yourself.	7	6
You should go to the hospital.	7	6
You know they're just going to call the cops.	7	6
I wish l was back in Detroit.	7	6
I've got that place wired.	7	6
Have you ever been arrested?	7	6
No. Never.	7	6
I guess you've been lucky.	7	6
Well, I appreciate this.	7	6
I'm going to miss having you around.	7	6
lam not of your stripe.	7	6
And you should think twice before you threaten me like that.	7	6
Please. I'm not threatening you.	7	6
We're moving the XP over to Campbell-Ewald,	7	6
and you're moving on.	7	6
- We're losing Chevy? - Don't worry.	7	6
GM loves the work, and they really love you.	7	6
Obviously not.	7	6
Your agency had a successful tryout,	7	6
but the plan was always to take the XP in-house.	7	6
But Buick is going to come to you with a great job offer.	7	6
What?	7	6
Well, that's very good news.	7	6
- When does all this happen? - lmminently.	7	6
What about you?	7	6
I'm gonna call in sick.	7	6
My wife understands, thank God.	7	6
That's a good idea.	7	6
How did you live in this city?	7	6
There's so much temptation.	7	6
It was hard.	7	6
Hello?	7	6
Trudy?	7	6
Come along, let's go say hi.	7	6
Hello, sweetie.	7	6
It's Daddy, sweetheart.	7	6
I got you a Barbie all the way from California.	7	6
Go ahead.	7	6
I don't believe we've met.	7	6
- Where's Trudy? - She's at the hairdresser.	7	6
I'm Verna.	7	6
Well, Verna's going to come with us to the car.	7	6
Tell me it was all a dream.	7	6
You're in a good mood.	7	6
Tell me you didn't miss this.	7	6
I missed you.	7	6
Well, we are going to eat this delicious breakfast...	7	6
and I'm going to take you shopping.	7	6
Okay.	7	6
Hey, baby, I'm almost ready.	7	6
"""Hi, baby"" yourself. I've been here since 10:00."	7	6
- Oh, it's you. - Are you coming in?	7	6
Find something else to do today. That's an order.	7	6
I don't like the idea.	7	6
Of doing something else?	7	6
No, the idea for Burger Chef.	7	6
"You haven't been ""noodling"" with anything else, have you?"	7	6
It came easy. You don't trust it.	7	6
- It didn't come easy at all. - So find a new one.	7	6
So you don't like it either.	7	6
The work is great! I'm positive, exclamation point!	7	6
How do I know you're not just saying that	7	6
so you don't have to come in?	7	6
Do you need me to come in?	7	6
No.	7	6
Your baby's calling.	7	6
But we both know there's a better idea.	7	6
There's always a better idea.	7	6
Bye.	7	6
Look at you!	7	6
You say good-bye to your daddy, and then you're going to take a bath.	7	6
- Where's Trudy? - She's out, Mr. Campbell.	7	6
Her car's in the drive.	7	6
Well, she came back, but then she went out.	7	6
Why don't you give Tammy a bath and let me tuck her in?	7	6
Of course, Mr. Campbell.	7	6
- Hello? - Hello, dear.	7	6
I'm afraid I've been waylaid in Cos Cob.	7	6
You go without me. I'll pick you up for a drink after.	7	6
"You really want me to see ""Oh! Calcutta!"" by myself?"	7	6
Trudy must've forgotten.	7	6
There's no one to look after Tammy.	7	6
Oh.	7	6
That's rather inconsiderate, isn't it?	7	6
I'm sure it's just a mistake.	7	6
Well, I'm going to wait until the very last minute.	7	6
That's sweet. I'll make it up to you.	7	6
You most certainly will.	7	6
- Should I get it? - It's not for me.	7	6
- Hello? - Oh, I'm glad I caught you.	7	6
- Are you on your way out? - Just sitting down to dinner.	7	6
Well, it's just--	7	6
"I just wanted to let you know that I tried your ""kids' point of view"" idea,"	7	6
and it's not good.	7	6
Well, it was great hearing from you.	7	6
It's just I know, now that you're presenting,	7	6
you're prone to more serious thought,	7	6
and I just wanted you to know that one's a loser.	7	6
I'm always working, Peggy. So are you.	7	6
Why are you undermining me?	7	6
From now on I won't express myself.	7	6
Well, now it's tainted.	7	6
It's poisoned, because you expressed yourself.	7	6
If you don't want to do it, don't do it.	7	6
Did you lose your appetite?	7	6
Absolutely not.	7	6
Oh, hello.	7	6
Did you just get back?	7	6
No, but you did.	7	6
Is Tammy still up?	7	6
No. We said our good nights.	7	6
Verna's back there hiding somewhere.	7	6
Well, did you have a nice time?	7	6
I was in fine spirits till I thought about you	7	6
pulled over on the side of the road necking with Charlie Fiddich.	7	6
- Charlie Fiddich? - Well, who was it, then?	7	6
Or are you going to keep it a secret from me	7	6
like your father's heart attack?	7	6
You've seen your daughter for the year.	7	6
Don't you have a plane to catch?	7	6
I don't like you carrying on like this. It's immoral.	7	6
- You have a child. - What?!	7	6
You picked tonight for your date?	7	6
You still care about me.	7	6
I know your debutante maneuvers.	7	6
We're getting a divorce.	7	6
We're still married.	7	6
You're not part of this family anymore.	7	6
Good night.	7	6
Well, hello there.	7	6
Well, hello yourself.	7	6
Somebody missed you.	7	6
You're early, but welcome.	7	6
These are for you.	7	6
And that is for you.	7	6
- Wow. - It's an Erector Set.	7	6
America needs engineers.	7	6
What do you say to Uncle Bob?	7	6
Thank you.	7	6
I know everybody got something, but I was shopping in Midtown	7	6
all day yesterday and I struck out.	7	6
The Jews close everything on Saturday.	7	6
I'm starving.	7	6
I see a day that starts with pancakes	7	6
and ends with an ice cream sundae.	7	6
Should I bring the stroller?	7	6
I'll carry him if l have to.	7	6
Let me get my bag.	7	6
What are you looking for?	7	6
Oh, good morning.	7	6
The fondue pot. It's not in the kitchen.	7	6
Coffee's fine.	7	6
No, I thought it would get some use out there.	7	6
I thought you just needed summer clothes.	7	6
I miss my things.	7	6
You were dead to the world.	7	6
I sleep better when you're here.	7	6
Oh, I miss you, too.	7	6
I'm sorry the visit's so short.	7	6
Can I just check this in on the plane?	7	6
How much is there? I can take some.	7	6
When?	7	6
The next time I come. End of July.	7	6
You know what?	7	6
I want to see you somewhere where there's nothing else going on.	7	6
Not LA. Not here.	7	6
Just us.	7	6
That'd be nice.	7	6
Air-conditioning.	7	6
Delicious.	7	6
- Did you have fun? - You ate already?	7	6
I'm sorry, I was hungry.	7	6
I can eat again.	7	6
Look at these feet.	7	6
I wore my sandals and I look like a hobo.	7	6
My toenails are black.	7	6
You can't wear those in the city.	7	6
You might as well be barefoot.	7	6
Will you try on your wares? Slowly?	7	6
At least you're in a better mood.	7	6
Come over here.	7	6
Did you get your work done?	7	6
Some of it.	7	6
Well, this is my vacation,	7	6
and I knew you were going to the office,	7	6
but the first Saturday we spent here, you needed to see your daughter.	7	6
Then you didn't come home,	7	6
which I understand was Trudy's fault.	7	6
Then you were grumpy. Okay.	7	6
Then I amused myself all morning,	7	6
and when I come back, you ordered room service?	7	6
I'm inundated, sweetheart.	7	6
I don't like you in New York.	7	6
Well, then you don't like me.	7	6
You're not going to fuck your way out of this.	7	6
What?	7	6
I'm going to wash my feet.	7	6
How's it going?	7	6
Did you park your white horse outside?	7	6
"Spare me the suspense and tell me what your ""save the day"" plan is."	7	6
I don't have anything yet.	7	6
The idea I had wasn't great.	7	6
It wasn't great. It was terrible.	7	6
I want to hear the real one.	7	6
Or are you just going to pull it out during the presentation?	7	6
This idea is good.	7	6
I think we can get the client to buy it.	7	6
No, you don't, or you wouldn't have questioned it.	7	6
I'm going to do whatever you say.	7	6
So you're going to pitch the hell out of my shitty idea,	7	6
and I'm going to fail.	7	6
Peggy, I'm here to help you do whatever you want to do.	7	6
Well, how am I supposed to know?	7	6
That's a tough one.	7	6
- You love this. - Not really.	7	6
I want you to feel good about what you're doing,	7	6
but you'll never know.	7	6
That's just the job.	7	6
What's the job?	7	6
"Living in the ""not knowing."""	7	6
You know, l wouldn’t have argued if it was me.	7	6
I would have just given you a hundred ideas	7	6
and never questioned why.	7	6
You really want to help me?	7	6
Show me how you think.	7	6
Do it out loud.	7	6
You can't tell people what they want.	7	6
It has to be what you want.	7	6
I want to go to the movies.	7	6
"I just came back from ""I Am Curious."""	7	6
I'm still scandalized.	7	6
Of course Megan would want to see a dirty movie.	7	6
- You want to work? - It doesn't matter if I want to.	7	6
I have to, because all of this is crap.	7	6
Pros and cons.	7	6
Pros-- it's almost done and it's good.	7	6
The account man's overjoyed and the client's on board.	7	6
Those are the cons, and you know it.	7	6
Well...	7	6
whenever I'm really unsure about an idea,	7	6
first I...	7	6
I abuse the people whose help I need.	7	6
And then I take a nap.	7	6
Done.	7	6
Then I start at the beginning again...	7	6
see if I end up in the same place.	7	6
Mom's job is to make dinner.	7	6
Burger Chef's job is to stop her.	7	6
What is it about that thing? Little boys love it.	7	6
"""The End of a Party"" plays in background"	7	6
You're a very lucky person.	7	6
Have I been complaining too much?	7	6
No.	7	6
- Did Gail go to bed? - She did.	7	6
I know I shouldn't be saying this,	7	6
because my heart is pounding.	7	6
What?	7	6
I know I said I didn't get you anything...	7	6
but I did.	7	6
Bob, put that away.	7	6
I know I should have done this a long time ago.	7	6
Did I miss my chance?	7	6
No.	7	6
I don't know.	7	6
So you don't feel anything for me?	7	6
My face doesn't please you?	7	6
I don't believe it.	7	6
You don't want this.	7	6
You're not listening to me.	7	6
Bob...	7	6
you shouldn't be with a woman.	7	6
I have been, you know.	7	6
Why are you doing this now?	7	6
Well, honestly...	7	6
I'm moving onto Buick.	7	6
And GM expects a certain kind of executive.	7	6
- You're leaving the agency? - Yes.	7	6
But that's why it would work so well.	7	6
You could stay here, do whatever you want.	7	6
Kevin would have a father.	7	6
Or you could come with me.	7	6
You'd love Detroit.	7	6
We could have a mansion.	7	6
- When did all this happen? - I just heard it.	7	6
And you can't relay it,	7	6
because they're moving the XP to Campbell-Ewald.	7	6
- We lost Chevy? - Yes, but the audition was a success.	7	6
There's something else coming down the road.	7	6
The times like this, Joan--	7	6
this is when you need someone.	7	6
We could comfort each other through an uncertain world.	7	6
I can't think about this right now.	7	6
I'm thinking about you, Joan.	7	6
Is this what you want?	7	6
To be near 40 in a two-bedroom apartment	7	6
with a mother and a little boy?	7	6
I know I am flawed,	7	6
but I am offering you more than anyone else ever will.	7	6
No, you're not, Bob.	7	6
Because I want love.	7	6
And I'd rather die hoping that happens	7	6
than make some arrangement.	7	6
And you should, too.	7	6
I'm just being realistic.	7	6
Good night.	7	6
"""Forever and Ever"" plays in background"	7	6
Okay, so in this new version, Dad's driving the car.	7	6
Mom's next to him, admiring?	7	6
How about a convertible?	7	6
Little boy and little girl in the back,	7	6
Dad's got a pipe in his mouth.	7	6
Jesus, it's going to look like 1955.	7	6
1955 was a good year.	7	6
I don't remember.	7	6
1965 was a good year.	7	6
I got married.	7	6
Moms love Burger Chef because it's an answer to a crisis.	7	6
What if Mom's coming home from work?	7	6
What's her profession?	7	6
You are surrounded	7	6
by all kinds of mothers who work, Don.	7	6
It's too sad for an ad.	7	6
Fine.	7	6
She burned the roast,	7	6
she dented the fender...	7	6
Keep going-	7	6
She backed over the dog,	7	6
little Katie's pregnant, Jimmy got drafted,	7	6
but there is still a burger and fries on that table?	7	6
Does this family exist anymore?	7	6
Are there people who eat dinner	7	6
and smile at each other instead of watching TV?	7	6
Did you ever do that with your family?	7	6
I don't remember.	7	6
What the hell do I know about being a mom?	7	6
I just turned 30, Don.	7	6
Shit. When?	7	6
A couple of weeks ago.	7	6
It doesn't matter.	7	6
I kept it as secret as I could.	7	6
Now I'm one of those women lying about her age.	7	6
I hate them.	7	6
I worry about a lot of things,	7	6
but I don't worry about you.	7	6
What do you have to worry about?	7	6
That I never did anything,	7	6
and that I don't have anyone.	7	6
I was in Ohio,	7	6
Michigan, Pennsylvania.	7	6
I looked in the window of so many station wagons.	7	6
What did I do wrong?	7	6
You're doing great.	7	6
What if there was a place	7	6
where you could go...	7	6
where there was no TV...	7	6
and you could break bread...	7	6
and whoever you were sitting with was family?	7	6

It's official. The XP is no longer ours.	7	6
But they've thought of a name.	7	6
"They're going to call it ""Roger Sterling's failure."""	7	6
- I thought you signed them. - Where did you hear this?	7	6
You knew?	7	6
I think we should get ahead of this.	7	6
"I'm proposing a ""New York Times"" article"	7	6
"and the ""Journal,"" too, announcing that we're open for business"	7	6
with our IBM 360 and our proprietary software.	7	6
And there's a big picture of Harry Crane,	7	6
our newest partner.	7	6
What?	7	6
The rest of it's fine, but Harry Crane's a partner?	7	6
If that's what it takes.	7	6
I'm not going limping into Burger Chef.	7	6
Why does he have to be a partner?	7	6
Say what you will, but he's very loyal.	7	6
All in favor?	7	6
Opposed?	7	6
The motion carries. With two abstentions.	7	6
All right, everybody back to work.	7	6
I've got it.	7	6
- What the hell do you want? - Not Harry Crane as partner.	7	6
Well, you knew about Chevy, and you didn't tell me.	7	6
- I could have done something. - There was nothing to do.	7	6
Spill the beans or get out.	7	6
Bob Benson told me.	7	6
- He's going to Buick. - Bob Benson?	7	6
- Please don't get him in trouble. - You're kidding?	7	6
- I knew McCann was up to something. - What are you talking about?	7	6
They're afraid we're going to steal Buick.	7	6
What?	7	6
Just forget it. Thank you.	7	6
Now we have nothing. We're only weeks away.	7	6
Just hear her out.	7	6
She'll have you done in time for dinner.	7	6
My plans got cancelled.	7	6
Look around.	7	6
I want to shoot the ad in here.	7	6
- It's not a home. - It's better.	7	6
It's a clean, well-lighted place.	7	6
Okay, Hemingway.	7	6
As long as it's still about moms.	7	6
It's about family.	7	6
Every table here is the family table.	7	6
"I hate even the word ""family."""	7	6
It's vague.	7	6
"""Mom"" is more specific. Tell her, Don."	7	6
She's doing it the way she wants to do it.	7	6

12... 11...	7	7
- ( loud whirring )  - 10... Nine...	7	7
- Ignition sequence starts... - Damn it, turn that vacuum off!	7	7
- Hattie!  - King: Five...  Four... Three...	7	7
- ( whirring stops )  - two... One... Zero.	7	7
All engines running.	7	7
Liftoff.  We have a liftoff.	7	7
32 minutes past the hour.	7	7
Liftoff on apollo 11.	7	7
 Walter cronkite:  Boy.	7	7
Oh boy,  it looks good.	7	7
You know what?  Why don't you swing  down to irvine?	7	7
We have a lot more  groves down there.	7	7
Passenger #2:  Can we go to tijuana?	7	7
I'm tired at looking  at oranges.	7	7
Ted:  There's more to look  at than the ground.	7	7
Imagine what it's like  for the astronauts.	7	7
They're probably  scared.	7	7
Why?  Maybe they  won't make it.	7	7
All their problems  will be over.	7	7
You know how to fly  this thing?	7	7
( engine stops )	7	7
What are you doing?	7	7
 See that spot along 66?  Probably claremont.	7	7
Good spot for  smoldering wreckage.	7	7
- It's not funny.  - Turn it back on  this minute!	7	7
You wanted to go up  in the plane, we went up  in the plane.	7	7
- My god,  we're gonna die!  - ( groaning )	7	7
Well, I thought  I'd talk to you  privately first,	7	7
Because your next  call is going to be  from pete campbell.	7	7
Have him call me.	7	7
I'd love to hear  his version of it.	7	7
Well, pete says that  sunkist called him  distraught.	7	7
( silent )	7	7
Severely distraught  because apparently  you cut the engines	7	7
And scared them  half to death.	7	7
And also expressed a real  feeling of wanting to die.	7	7
You used to fly.  Didn't you ever feel that?	7	7
Over dresden?  I wanted to live.	7	7
( yelling )  and the clients want  to live, too, ted!	7	7
I thought  this was private.	7	7
He's leaving.	7	7
Look, jim,  I don't want to die.	7	7
I just don't wanna  do this anymore.	7	7
- Do what?  - Advertising.	7	7
I wanna do something else.  Somewhere else.	7	7
- I don't think  that's possible.  - Sure, it is.	7	7
You're gonna buy me out.	7	7
Ted, you don't know  what you're saying.	7	7
I've made up my mind.  Goodbye.	7	7
( tv playing )	7	7
- ( intercom buzzes )  - madeline: Mr. Avery's here.	7	7
Send him in.	7	7
Just wanted to say commander cigarettes is dead.	7	7
Leo burnett says they're rolling it up with the rest of philip morris.	7	7
Oh, well,  that's too bad.	7	7
But I suppose now people  will know we're in the  tobacco business again.	7	7
- And that's good.  - Oh, sure.	7	7
There's a cork-tipped newport in the works.	7	7
"Shall I invite them to ""don draper dinner theater""?"	7	7
Maybe a matinee?	7	7
10 years I've built  a tobacco resume	7	7
And one meeting  turned me into a joke.	7	7
I'm gonna crawl  outta this place with  nothing left to show.	7	7
We don't  owe you anything.	7	7
You're a hired hand!  Now get back to work.	7	7
- ( door closes )  - ( huffs )	7	7
Bobby! Sally!  Get down here!  You're being rude!	7	7
But I know I  put it in the car.	7	7
Neil, that's enough.	7	7
"""the case of the  missing telescope."""	7	7
Neil can bunk  with bobby,	7	7
And there's  a daybed in the  sewing room for sean.	7	7
Sean, neil.  This is bobby and sally.	7	7
Where's your  little brother?	7	7
My goodness,  sally.	7	7
You look like your  mother freshman year.	7	7
Carolyn, you're the one  with the fully grown men.	7	7
- You have such a lovely home.  - Where are we supposed  to put these?	7	7
I'll show you.	7	7
Don't let the lady  carry a bag.	7	7
Oh, it's fine.  I'm strong.	7	7
Let me get it.	7	7
Follow me, rick.	7	7
Bobby, show neil  your telescope.	7	7
It'll give you  an excuse to take it  out of the box.	7	7
You can't see anything  during the daytime.	7	7
That's not true.	7	7
( sighs )  come on.	7	7
Of course, now that  my partnership is  on the table,	7	7
Jennifer has stopped  talking about divorce.	7	7
She's postponing  the conversation.	7	7
Yeah, till after  I get that money.	7	7
Don, can you be impartial?  What do I hold out for?	7	7
Don't negotiate, just accept the deal.	7	7
Should we take it  from the top?	7	7
"""welcome, welcome."	7	7
"Indiana's beautiful  this time of year."""	7	7
I tell a joke,  everyone laughs.	7	7
Then harry gets up  and doesn't squander the  good will I've just generated.	7	7
- I have a joke, too.  - No, you don't.	7	7
"""local buy, national buy,  outdoor."""	7	7
I tell them about  the ibm 360, but...	7	7
I don't show them  a picture, because we  only show pictures of ads.	7	7
Peggy.	7	7
We were scared  until we knew the genuine  superiority of burger chef.	7	7
More general flattery,  research, research.	7	7
"""without further ado,  donald draper."" don?"	7	7
Is that what you're  going to say?	7	7
Don't worry about what  she's going to say.	7	7
I was going  to say that...	7	7
"""every great ad  is a story,"	7	7
And here to tell you  that story	7	7
Is our creative director  and partner,	7	7
"Donald draper."""	7	7
Don?	7	7
( sighs )	7	7
"""I don't know  about your dinner table,"	7	7
But I know about mine.	7	7
"- When I get home--""  - that's fine."	7	7
Now we just have to pray  everything goes smoothly  on the moon.	7	7
Hello?	7	7
Oh, I'm sorry.	7	7
Where's kazmir?	7	7
He had to run  downtown.	7	7
Oh.	7	7
Well, it looks like  you're doing a good job.	7	7
Once you get  the grid up,	7	7
You just try not  to break the tiles.	7	7
I'm peggy,  by the way.	7	7
( exhales )  I'm nick.	7	7
You've got  a lot of books.	7	7
It's so hot  in here.	7	7
Would you like  some iced tea?	7	7
Kaz should give you  a discount, your son  was a big help.	7	7
My son?	7	7
Oh, julio?  No, he's my  neighbor.	7	7
I own  the building.	7	7
By yourself?	7	7
( tv playing )	7	7
I was very clear  I am not paying before  it's finished.	7	7
That's my number.	7	7
In case you have any  odd jobs too small for kaz.	7	7
Well, thank you.	7	7
- Good night.  - Good night.	7	7
Good night, kid.	7	7
Can I have a popsicle?  I only had one today.	7	7
Sure.	7	7
So then rutgers  promised him a generous  athletic scholarship.	7	7
It was nice  he had choices,	7	7
But I don't see  any passion.	7	7
I don't remember  dreaming of anything  but paris at his age.	7	7
Paris and ty power.	7	7
How did I  marry rick?	7	7
- He has no eyelashes.  - ( laughing )	7	7
So...	7	7
I have to ask.  Do you ever see don?	7	7
Only when  absolutely necessary.	7	7
I'm starting to think of him as an old, bad boyfriend.	7	7
Someone a teenage anthropologist would marry.	7	7
- Is there any oatmeal?  - Carolyn: Good morning,  mister.	7	7
Good morning,  mrs. Francis.	7	7
Betty.	7	7
Go get decent.	7	7
- Hey, sorry.  - I'm sorry,  I'm late.	7	7
What can I  get you?	7	7
She gets to eat  in a bathing suit?	7	7
- 'cause I swim  in these shorts.  - I can't eat anything	7	7
Because I'm a lifeguard and I can't wait an hour.	7	7
Go.	7	7
Bye, everyone.	7	7
She is  so beautiful.	7	7
Particularly today.	7	7
She's never worn lipstick to the pool before.	7	7
Because before they  reach the surface  of the moon,	7	7
They're gonna  throw down an anchor.	7	7
And what if that  sinks right into it?	7	7
Hmm? What if  it's quicksand?	7	7
- Am I late  for something?  - No.	7	7
May I speak  with you?	7	7
What's going on?	7	7
You got this letter  this morning	7	7
And it's very  upsetting news.	7	7
Are they firing you?	7	7
I don't know.	7	7
"What does that mean, ""breach of contract""?"	7	7
This is from  the agency's attorney.	7	7
Why didn't they  call me?	7	7
Look at you.	7	7
You're so confused.	7	7
You never even met with commander cigarettes.	7	7
I would have known.  ( sniffles )	7	7
- It doesn't matter.  - ( sniffling )	7	7
I want you  to listen to me.	7	7
I know you're feeling vulnerable,	7	7
But I am  your strength.	7	7
Tell me  what I can do.	7	7
You can  get my attorney  on the phone.	7	7
And we  can't do this.	7	7
You're right.	7	7
Not right now.	7	7
( door opens, closes )	7	7
You think you're gonna  throw me out of my  own company?	7	7
Madeline,  I've got it.	7	7
Todd, could you  excuse us?	7	7
Don has a habit of walking into meetings	7	7
Unannounced.	7	7
- Should I reschedule?  - Get out!	7	7
It was cut and dry. You broke the stipulations	7	7
Of the addendum  to your contract.	7	7
You set that  meeting to force me  out of the agency.	7	7
What was I  supposed to do?	7	7
You know,  ted and I,	7	7
Whenever we would  hear that your agency  was involved,	7	7
We'd always be  so intimidated.	7	7
"""what was that man  up to?"""	7	7
Such a cloud  of mystery.	7	7
Now that I've been backstage?	7	7
I'm deeply  unimpressed, don.	7	7
You're just a bully  and a drunk.	7	7
A football player in a suit.	7	7
The most eloquent  I've ever heard you	7	7
Was when you  were blubbering  like a little girl	7	7
About your  impoverished childhood.	7	7
What? You wanna  take a swing at me?	7	7
It would save us all  a lot of trouble.	7	7
( telephone rings )	7	7
- Is he in?  - He hasn't read it,  I just got it.	7	7
Hey!  Get out here!	7	7
- What's going on?  - I just got a breach letter	7	7
With your name on the bottom.	7	7
- What?  - Joan!  Get out here.	7	7
Joan!  Could you get  cooper out here?	7	7
- What's going on?  - Find pete.	7	7
- No one knows  about this?  - I saw it.	7	7
"Then why did you say,  ""what's going on""?"	7	7
I want you to calm down. I just called jim,	7	7
We're going to get  to the bottom of this.	7	7
- Is there a meeting?  - Have you seen this?	7	7
Is this a  partners' meeting?	7	7
You're not  a partner yet.	7	7
This is  outrageous.	7	7
You know we're going  to be at burger chef  on Monday.	7	7
I vote against this.  Right now.	7	7
It's not subject to a vote.	7	7
The contract was very clear.	7	7
You wanna play  parliamentary procedure?  Let's play.	7	7
Everyone who wants  to get rid of me,  raise your hand.	7	7
Fine.  I have ted's proxy.	7	7
You had no right  to put my name on that.	7	7
Anyone else?	7	7
All opposed?	7	7
Motion denied.	7	7
That is a very sensitive  piece of horseflesh.	7	7
He shouldn't be  rattled.	7	7
He's a pain  in the ass.	7	7
- You knew about this?  - No. But I'm tired  of him costing me money.	7	7
We all set those  stipulations, and  he signed them.	7	7
You shouldn't have  done that.	7	7
( door closes )	7	7
( knocking on door )	7	7
- Can I watch tv?  - I'm sorry, you can't.  I'm working.	7	7
Wait, get in here.	7	7
This is a suit  and it has a skirt	7	7
And it has gray in it,  which is what men wear.	7	7
And this is a dress  and it's pretty,	7	7
But I might be  sweating	7	7
And not just because  it's July.	7	7
- Forget it.  - I gotta watch Sunday.	7	7
That's when they're  supposed to land.	7	7
I'm sorry, but  I'm going to be  in indianapolis.	7	7
- Why?  - Because we're  presenting to burger chef	7	7
Monday morning.	7	7
I know, the astronauts  may not make it, and then  what are we gonna say?	7	7
Oh.	7	7
I'm sorry.	7	7
- They're going to be fine.  - It's not fair!	7	7
You know what?  I'll give you the key	7	7
And you can come down  and watch yourself.	7	7
Just don't use  the stove again.	7	7
I don't wanna go  to newark.	7	7
- Nobody does.  - My uncle has a house  and he got my mom a job.	7	7
I don't  wanna leave!	7	7
You're moving?	7	7
( faintly )  well...	7	7
Well, that's okay.	7	7
Maybe you'll  have a yard.	7	7
You want your mom  to have a job, don't you?	7	7
She don't care  about me.	7	7
( softly )  yes, she does.	7	7
That's why  she's moving.	7	7
I'll visit you  all the time.	7	7
No, you won't.	7	7
- You can watch tv  while I pack.  - Okay.	7	7
( phone rings )	7	7
- Hello?  - Hello.	7	7
What are you up to?	7	7
I'm going to the movies  with jill.	7	7
"I think we're gonna see  ""the wild bunch."""	7	7
I wanna see that.	7	7
You want me to wait?	7	7
When are you going  to indiana?	7	7
I don't even know  if I'm going.	7	7
What happened?	7	7
They're going  to fire me.	7	7
( sighs )	7	7
I'm sorry.	7	7
I thought if I kept  my head down and...	7	7
Did my job--	7	7
I guess that's not  what they want.	7	7
What do they want?	7	7
They want me  to move on.	7	7
Well, maybe you should.	7	7
Aren't you tired  of fighting?	7	7
Yes.	7	7
I guess I could see it  as an opportunity.	7	7
I could finally  move out there.	7	7
( sighs )	7	7
- Megan?  - I'm here.	7	7
Is that what you  want me to do?	7	7
Don...	7	7
I'll always  take care of you.	7	7
I'll be fine.	7	7
Well, until you are.	7	7
Whatever you need.	7	7
I owe you that.	7	7
You don't owe me  anything.	7	7
Goodbye, don.	7	7
( line clicks )	7	7
- What are we gonna do  about cutler?  - Sit, take off your shoes.	7	7
I don't feel  like it.	7	7
Whoever is in control  is in charge.	7	7
We're in control!  We've got the votes--	7	7
Except for  benedict joan.	7	7
Don cost her a  million dollars when  we didn't go public.	7	7
So you want him  out, too?	7	7
Do you understand  don draper can  work anywhere?	7	7
No man has ever  come back from leave.  Even napoleon.	7	7
He staged a coup,  but he ended up  back on that island.	7	7
So why didn't you vote him out?	7	7
Because I'm a leader  and a leader is loyal  to his team.	7	7
Don doesn't  understand that.	7	7
But I do.	7	7
And you have  talent and skill  and experience.	7	7
- But you're  not a leader.  - And cutler is?	7	7
He has a vision,  but he's not on my team.	7	7
"So, ""let's have another cup of coffee, let's have  another piece of pie""?"	7	7
( door bangs )	7	7
Pilot on p.A.:  Ladies and gentlemen,  we'd like to ask you now	7	7
To extinguish  your cigarettes as we  prepare for takeoff.	7	7
I'd like to say  that we'll be sharing  the sky today	7	7
With one other  notable aircraft,	7	7
And I'd like to wish  fellow pilots	7	7
Neil armstrong,  buzz aldrin and mike collins	7	7
Godspeed  and a safe return.	7	7
Why did you have to do that? Now I feel like we're in danger.	7	7
If they don't make it,  we're going to have to	7	7
Postpone this thing  for a year.	7	7
You're going to go in there  and you're going to win this.	7	7
And if cutler doesn't  like it, I'm sorry,	7	7
But the don draper  show is back	7	7
From its unscheduled  interruption.	7	7
I appreciate that, but I'm not rattled.	7	7
Well, you're  sighing a lot.	7	7
What do you say  you come out to  california?	7	7
It's possible  if all goes well that  I could be spending	7	7
Part of my time  in new york.	7	7
And ted's going to  run that place  into the ground.	7	7
He's off  the deep end.	7	7
Lane pryce.	7	7
There's no reason  to go to l.A.	7	7
Is megan  moving back?	7	7
Marriage  is a racket.	7	7
( crickets chirping )	7	7
- It's happening!  - Come on, come on.  Let's go, let's go!	7	7
Come on.	7	7
( tv playing )	7	7
Indiana's dry  on Sunday.	7	7
I had to buy these  off the night clerk.	7	7
Neil armstrong:  Getting back up to that  first step...	7	7
He came out.	7	7
Armstrong: ...Not even collapsed too far,  but it's adequate...	7	7
- Don: Two beers?  - Mission control:  Roger. We copy.	7	7
Armstrong:  It takes a pretty good  little jump.	7	7
Walter cronkite:  So there's a foot  on the moon.	7	7
Stepping down  on the moon.	7	7
If he's testing  that first step,	7	7
He must be stepping down  on the moon at this point.	7	7
Mission control:  Buzz, this is houston.	7	7
F2-1/160 second  for shadow photography  on the sequence camera.	7	7
Buzz aldrin:  Okay.	7	7
Armstrong:  I'm at the foot  of the ladder.	7	7
The lem footpads are only	7	7
Depressed in the surface  about one or two inches,	7	7
Although the surface  appears to be	7	7
Very, very fine grained  as you get close to it.	7	7
It's almost  like a powder...	7	7
Down there.	7	7
It's very fine.	7	7
Cronkite:  Boy, look at those pictures.  Wow.	7	7
- It's a little shadowy, but--  - ( cheers, banging on wall )	7	7
Hot damn.	7	7
Cronkite:  Armstrong is on the moon.  Neil armstrong.	7	7
38-year-old american,  standing on the surface  of the moon.	7	7
On this July 20th, 1969.	7	7
Armstrong:  That's one small step  for man...	7	7
One giant leap  for mankind.	7	7
Bravo.	7	7
Wally schirra:  I think that was neil's quote,  I didn't understand.	7	7
"Cronkite:  Well, ""one small step  for man,"""	7	7
But I didn't get  the second phrase.	7	7
Mission control: Roger. We got you boresighted	7	7
But back under one track.	7	7
It's just incredible.	7	7
I'll tell you  what's incredible.	7	7
It cost 25  billion dollars.	7	7
Be quiet, sean.	7	7
- 'cause there's no  problems back on earth?  - I can't hear it.	7	7
( telephone rings )	7	7
It's probably nixon calling for henry.	7	7
- ( telephone rings )  - betty: Sally.	7	7
Okay.	7	7
- ( ringing continues )  - armstrong: ...Underneath  it says,	7	7
"""here man  from the planet earth..."""	7	7
- Francis residence.  - Hello, sweetheart.	7	7
- Hi, daddy.  - Isn't this something?	7	7
- I guess.  - So you're unimpressed?	7	7
It's such a waste  of money.	7	7
You don't really  think that, do you?	7	7
We'll be going there  all the time while people  go hungry down here.	7	7
Don't be so cynical.	7	7
You want your  little brothers  to talk that way?	7	7
No.	7	7
- Are they up?  - I'll go get them.	7	7
Neil, this is houston.  After you've got the  core tubes...	7	7
- ( phone ringing )  - mona: Just leave it alone.	7	7
Hello?	7	7
Yes, this is he.	7	7
Oh, shit.	7	7
What is it?	7	7
Joan:  Hello?	7	7
( sobs )  I'm so sorry.	7	7
Well, this is  unfortunate.	7	7
Yes.	7	7
Roger, my condolences.  He was a giant.	7	7
Thank you.	7	7
He was a  wonderful man.	7	7
I'll have  the obituary  ready in an hour,	7	7
And I suppose  we can divide up  the clients	7	7
And start  calling them.	7	7
It's 1:00  in the morning.	7	7
The agency and the world  are closed tomorrow.	7	7
Do we have  to do this now?	7	7
Well, as  tragic as this is,  I for one am happy	7	7
That we have a chance  to have a conversation  with the clients	7	7
About the future  of this company.	7	7
- ( sighs )  - and to give don draper  a send-off along with bert.	7	7
Excuse me?	7	7
I hate to remind you  that with harry's  partnership	7	7
And without bert,  don's dismissal is  a foregone conclusion.	7	7
Cooper's been  dead an hour	7	7
And you're pryin  his hand open?	7	7
Roger, I know  what this company  should look like.	7	7
Computer services.  Media buys pinpointed  with surgical accuracy.	7	7
We can offer the services  beyond our clients.	7	7
It's the agency  of the future.	7	7
Is this what would  happen if I died?	7	7
( sighs )	7	7
( crickets chirping )	7	7
Are you the only one  out here?	7	7
Yes.  Is that okay?	7	7
Yeah, I don't want  them giving me shit  for smoking.	7	7
Smoking  causes cancer.	7	7
How does it look? Can you see it?	7	7
The moon?  Nah, it's already set.	7	7
Then why aren't you  watching tv?	7	7
I don't wanna  listen to them  or the reporters.	7	7
Besides, there's other  things to look at.	7	7
Like what?	7	7
Polaris.  It's a star.	7	7
Take a look.	7	7
I can't see  anything.	7	7
Do you see  your eyelashes?	7	7
Yes.	7	7
Okay.	7	7
Tilt your head back  and open your eyes  really wide.	7	7
Okay.	7	7
I think I see it.	7	7
Isn't that better  than tv?	7	7
It is.	7	7
What do I do now?	7	7
Carolyn:  Neil, honey?  Where are you?	7	7
I'm outside.	7	7
Carolyn:  Get in here!  It's bedtime!	7	7
Neil, this is houston. Did you get the hasselblad...	7	7
( telephone ringing )	7	7
- Hello?  - Figured you'd  still be up.	7	7
Roger?  How'd you find me?	7	7
Your itinerary was on  caroline's desk.	7	7
I'm at the office.	7	7
Bert passed away.	7	7
He was in his living room  on the couch.	7	7
Roger, I'm so sorry.	7	7
I know what he  meant to you.	7	7
Well, now I'm  gonna lose you, too.	7	7
We don't have  the votes anymore.	7	7
It's the first thing  cutler said.	7	7
( sighs )  well, he's consistent.	7	7
Poor bert.	7	7
I should've realized  it was the end.	7	7
Every time  an old man starts  talking about napoleon,	7	7
You know  they're gonna die.	7	7
Is his sister  still alive?	7	7
He was hard on me,  you know?	7	7
But maybe  he was right.	7	7
The last thing I said to him  were the lines to some  old song.	7	7
Come on, roger,  you know he was very  proud of you.	7	7
Give 'em hell tomorrow.	7	7
Okay.	7	7
( sighs )	7	7
( sighs )	7	7
Aldrin:  Okay. The hatch is closed  and latched...	7	7
- ( knocking on door )  - ( tv playing )	7	7
May I speak  with you?	7	7
Of course.  Is something wrong?	7	7
May I come in?	7	7
There's been  a change of plans.	7	7
You're gonna give  the presentation  tomorrow.	7	7
Did harry tell you  about my dream?	7	7
What? No.	7	7
We have a couple hours.  You can practice it with  me and still be fresh.	7	7
- Are you serious?  - You're gonna be great.	7	7
No. Stop  messing around.	7	7
It's not funny.	7	7
( tv off )	7	7
( sighs )	7	7
You must have heard  that they're trying  to get me out.	7	7
If I win  this business,  and then I go,	7	7
You'll be left  with nothing.	7	7
They're trying  to get you out?	7	7
I thought everything  was finally back  to normal.	7	7
Me, too, but...	7	7
Sometimes actions  have consequences	7	7
And one of  them is I can't  present tomorrow.	7	7
You win this business  and it will be yours.	7	7
No, don.	7	7
It's tomorrow.  I'm unprepared.	7	7
You've been listening  to me for weeks.	7	7
Well, I can't just say what you've been saying.	7	7
"I'm a woman.  I'm the ""voice  of moms,"" remember?"	7	7
Maybe  that's better.	7	7
Maybe that's  the way it always  should have been.	7	7
Well, pete  won't stand for it.	7	7
Pete's pregnant.  He has to do what we say.	7	7
No. Cancel it.  What about the moon landing?	7	7
- It was a success.  - No, don.	7	7
I have to talk  to people who just  touched the face of god	7	7
About hamburgers!	7	7
I wouldn't do this  if I didn't know  you could.	7	7
You've never even  seen me present.	7	7
I've overheard things.	7	7
We have no liquor.	7	7
Good morning.	7	7
Did you see we  landed on the moon?	7	7
( chuckles )  is that right?	7	7
Neil armstrong, what  are you going to do with  the rest of your life?	7	7
Screw every girl  in florida, I guess.	7	7
So you called me  at sunrise to discuss  the meaning of life?	7	7
No. I just want to know  if buick had left you yet.	7	7
Why would they  do that?	7	7
Because we've built  a relationship with gm	7	7
And they know we can  handle a bigger car.	7	7
And our chevy account  man just moved there.	7	7
Uncle.	7	7
So, you made  the overture.	7	7
What did you  have in mind?	7	7
Well...	7	7
We'd want the whole  chevy team.	7	7
You, jim cutler,  don draper,	7	7
And ted chaough.	7	7
We both know you're in  the acquisitions business.	7	7
I think...  You should buy  the whole company.	7	7
Because I have  a vision.	7	7
All our accounts,  our cutting-edge  computer,	7	7
And the employees that  I know to be worthy	7	7
As an independent  subsidiary of mccann.	7	7
You just lost  burger chef,  we may win it.	7	7
Then you'd still  have it.	7	7
And I'd have  my company--	7	7
Without jim cutler  and all that baggage  from cgc.	7	7
That's an  interesting idea.	7	7
But this is still  all about buick.	7	7
You have to bury  the hatchet with  ted chaough.	7	7
- Why?  - Because gm  thinks he	7	7
And don draper  are one person.	7	7
I don't know  if I can do that.	7	7
Well, then, I don't know  if I can help you.	7	7
( low whirring )	7	7
( coughs )	7	7
( faint voices  overlapping )	7	7
( whirring continues )	7	7
( laughing )	7	7
- ( whirring stops )  - I'm gonna be bold and say	7	7
That no one  in this room	7	7
Knows more about  the burger chef  customer	7	7
Than peggy olson.	7	7
She's visited  20 restaurants  in nine states,	7	7
Interviewed hundreds  and is obviously	7	7
Uniquely qualified  to craft this  modern campaign.	7	7
Every great ad  tells a story.	7	7
Here to tell that story  is peggy olson.	7	7
Thank you, don.	7	7
That's a lot  to live up to.	7	7
Because I certainly can't tell a better story	7	7
Than the one we saw last night.	7	7
I don't know what was more miraculous--	7	7
The technological achievement	7	7
That put our species in a new perspective	7	7
Or the fact that all of us were doing the same thing at the same time.	7	7
Sitting in this room,	7	7
We can still feel the pleasure of that connection.	7	7
Because, I realize now, we were starved for it.	7	7
We really were.	7	7
And, yes, we'll feel it again when they all return safely.	7	7
And, yes, the world will never be the same in some ways.	7	7
But tonight, I'm going to go back to new york,	7	7
And I'll go back  to my apartment	7	7
And find a 10-year-old boy	7	7
Parked in front of my tv, eating dinner.	7	7
Now, I don't need  to charge you for  a research report	7	7
That tells you that  most television sets	7	7
Are not more than  six feet away from  the dinner table.	7	7
And that dinner table	7	7
Is your battlefield and your prize.	7	7
This is the home  your customers  really live in.	7	7
This is your  dinner table.	7	7
Dad likes sinatra, son likes the rolling stones.	7	7
The tv's always on,  vietnam playing in  the background.	7	7
The news wins  every night.	7	7
And you're starving.	7	7
And not just  for dinner.	7	7
What if there  was another table,	7	7
Where everybody  gets what they want  when they want it?	7	7
It's bright and clean,	7	7
And there's no laundry,	7	7
No telephone,  and no tv.	7	7
And we can have  the connection	7	7
That we're hungry for.	7	7
There may be chaos  at home,	7	7
But there's family supper  at burger chef.	7	7
That's beautiful.	7	7
That's nice to hear	7	7
Because that's the name of the spot.	7	7
( chuckling )	7	7
We open on a bird's-eye view  of a typical kitchen table.	7	7
( elevator bell pings )	7	7
- Welcome home.  - How'd you get  in here?	7	7
Money.  But he wouldn't  open the door.	7	7
I need  to talk to ya.	7	7
Cooper  still dead?	7	7
His situation  hasn't changed,  but ours has.	7	7
Can I  get a drink?	7	7
- Roger: How'd it go?  - Great.	7	7
That why you're here?	7	7
We got an offer  from mccann erickson  to buy the agency.	7	7
Hear me out.  We'd be a subsidiary,  separately operated.	7	7
We keep our name,  our offices,  you keep your job--	7	7
Your real job--  and I'll be  the president.	7	7
- Of mccann?  - No, of sterling cooper.	7	7
They know we're primed  for a big car,	7	7
And they don't want  to compete with us.	7	7
Did you forget  we started this agency  to get away from them?	7	7
Yeah, I know that.  But a lot's happened  in between.	7	7
Most of it good,  but some of it very bad.	7	7
Without cooper, cutler's  gonna lock you out  by the end of the week.	7	7
- I don't want  to work for mccann.  - You're gonna work for me.	7	7
Don't fool yourself. You know they're not gonna leave us alone.	7	7
They did with marschalk.  And they're buying 51%.  You're gonna make a fortune.	7	7
Fine, you have my vote.  What's that gonna do?	7	7
You can't even  save my job, how are you  gonna sell the company?	7	7
I'm working on it.  You're of essence  to the deal.	7	7
But so is  ted chaough.	7	7
Ted chaough? What are you doing?	7	7
They want the guys  who won chevy.	7	7
Roger, I just wanna do my work. I don't wanna deal with business anymore.	7	7
And what  about everyone else?  We all send out resumes?	7	7
Cutler's not gonna stop  until the firm is just  harry and the computer.	7	7
That means  everybody goes.	7	7
And you know it.	7	7
( door closes )	7	7
- ( raps )  - ted, welcome back.	7	7
Well, I'm sorry  it's under these  circumstances.	7	7
I've instructed don  to gather everyone  at noon.	7	7
Did you want to  discuss the remarks?	7	7
I thought we would begin  with a poem of memorial  for bert.	7	7
"""o captain,  my captain""?"	7	7
Then we have a lot  of pressing business here	7	7
With finalizing don's  departure and--	7	7
And I have  an announcement  of my own.	7	7
We don't need  to deal with that today.	7	7
I haven't heard  anything.	7	7
- About what?  - Burger chef.	7	7
- Good morning.  - I'm glad that  you're here.	7	7
Would you please all have a seat?	7	7
There's coffee. I have some rather  urgent business.	7	7
I insist.	7	7
I'm coming to all of you with an incredible opportunity.	7	7
Mccann erickson wants to buy a 51% stake in sc&p.	7	7
We'll be  independently  operated,	7	7
And all they ask are  five-year contracts	7	7
From everyone.	7	7
- Including don?  - Especially don.	7	7
And you'll be  our king.	7	7
Well, I did put it together.	7	7
The details have to be worked out,	7	7
But we'll keep our office, our name, and our clients.	7	7
- Why would they do that?  - Because we finally  turned this place	7	7
Into a legitimate threat and they'd like to neutralize it  with cold, hard cash.	7	7
- How much?  - When did you  do this?	7	7
Since you asked, I'll  use you as an example.	7	7
Let's say they value  the agency at $65 million	7	7
And they buy  51% of it.	7	7
That means your 5%  share's worth a little  over $1.5 million.	7	7
- 25% of that upon signing.  - Oh, my goodness.	7	7
I've got 10%!	7	7
Keep counting  those chickens.	7	7
I hope you all realize  this is a pathetic  ploy and a delusion.	7	7
It is until everybody votes on it.	7	7
Sorry, just heard  about the partners' meeting.	7	7
- Perfect timing.  - He hasn't signed.  He missed the boat.	7	7
- What's going on?  - None of your beeswax.	7	7
- I'll take the deal.  - Goodbye, harry.	7	7
Don't worry about it.	7	7
- Well, I won't do it.  - That's fine because  you're not of essence.	7	7
- And you are?  - Yes, all they care about  is me, don, and ted.	7	7
Don, you're gonna sign  a contract to work at  mccann for five years?	7	7
- Well, I've given this  a lot of thought.  - I'm sure you did.	7	7
And I agree with roger that we should do everything we can	7	7
To keep jim from  breaking up the agency.	7	7
You mean,  save your hide.	7	7
Look, I don't want  to stand in the way	7	7
Of everyone making  all this money,	7	7
But I am done  with advertising.	7	7
Your 20% share will  be worth at least  $6 million.	7	7
I'm going to have  plenty of money	7	7
From selling  my partnership  as it stands.	7	7
Can't you do it  without me?	7	7
You don't think I tried that?	7	7
If I sign a contract  for five years,	7	7
That'll be  the rest of my life.	7	7
- You've got to be kidding me.  - You're not just pathetic,  you're selfish.	7	7
Well, I'm sorry, roger.	7	7
You may have the votes, but you don't have a deal.	7	7
Now can we dispense with this nonsense,	7	7
Go outside and say a fond farewell?	7	7
Ted.	7	7
What if I told you  that you could just  write copy	7	7
And fight clients  and not worry about	7	7
Partnership votes  or stock prices?	7	7
You could just  go back to creative.	7	7
I have that right now,  and I'm miserable.	7	7
No, you don't.	7	7
I really lost this  last year	7	7
And I realized  I would do anything  to get back in.	7	7
And I did anything.	7	7
I wrote tags,  I wrote coupons.	7	7
Things I haven't done  since I first got my start.	7	7
I know you.  I know the man who  I walked into chevy with.	7	7
You don't have  to work for us,	7	7
But you have to work.	7	7
You don't wanna  see what happens  when it's really gone.	7	7
You remember the last time he talked you into something?	7	7
I don't know.	7	7
- So, I'd move back to the city? - Ted's in. Let's have a vote.	7	7
- Hold on.  - Let's have a vote.	7	7
Everyone in favor.	7	7
( sighs )	7	7
Really?	7	7
It's a lot  of money.	7	7
( voices overlapping )	7	7
I just got off the phone  with burger chef.	7	7
They couldn't find  anyone.	7	7
We got it.	7	7
Well, they heard  what I heard.	7	7
Where are you going?	7	7
Back to work.	7	7
Dawn:  Excuse me, everyone. If I could have your attention.	7	7
Mr. Sterling  would like to make  an announcement.	7	7
Thank you, everyone.	7	7
It's difficult  that at this moment  of national pride,	7	7
We have to deal with  some sad, personal news.	7	7
Don, my boy.	7	7
- Bert?  - ¶ the stars in the sky ¶	7	7

(THEME SONG PLAYING)	7	8
I've never worn mink before.	7	8
It's chinchilla, and it costs $15,000.	7	8
How does that make you feel?	7	8
Nervous.	7	8
You're not supposed to talk.	7	8
Just show me how you feel.	7	8
Walk over to the mirror.	7	8
Look at yourself.	7	8
You like what you see.	7	8
Don't open the whole coat.	7	8
 Just try and make it lookhke	7	8
you're just wearing the fur.	7	8
Very good.	7	8
Now, I want you to close your eyes	7	8
and take a deep breath.	7	8
And when I tell you,	7	8
you're gonna put your leg up on that chair,	7	8
let the coat slide down,	7	8
and show me how smooth your skin is.	7	8
Very good, Cindy-	7	8
Thank you very much, Cindy. We'll let you know.	7	8
"WOMAN"". So, what happened?"	7	8
Well, no woman, even living in that shithole,	7	8
wants a toaster for her birthday.	7	8
 - Can you freshen this? - Yeah.	7	8
And Abigail wasn't shy.	7	8
- That's your mother? - Stepmother.	7	8
So she put the toaster in the middle of the table,	7	8
and all the boarders come down for breakfast and see it.	7	8
They weren't particularly impressed.	7	8
Every day, one of them would trip over that wire	7	8
and yank it off the table.	7	8
Don't go back there. A lot of roaches.	7	8
Are you surprised?	7	8
Only by the size. There was one making a phone call.	7	8
(LAUGHS)	7	8
Get up, I want my seat back.	7	8
Now, toasters were indestructible back then,	7	8
except for the cord,	7	8
which suffered from being yanked out of the wall every morning.	7	8
My Uncle Mack was cheap and thought he could fix things.	7	8
So he wrapped a piece of copper wire around it.	7	8
Sure enough, he plugged it in and it blew him into the parlor.	7	8
He was unconscious.	7	8
(GIRLS LAUGHING)	7	8
All the boarders got up, ran to his aid,	7	8
but Abigail didn't move.	7	8
She just looked down at him and said	7	8
"""Happy birthday."""	7	8
(GIRLS LAUGHING)	7	8
Then put the kettle on.	7	8
He loves to tell stories about how poor he was,	7	8
but he's not anymore.	7	8
Is that your way of saying you want me to get the check?	7	8
Hey, Mildred Pierce, can I get the check?	7	8
- Come on. - Be polite.	7	8
- Can I get you something else? - No, just the check.	7	8
You have anything by John Dos Passos?	7	8
(GIRLS LAUGHING)	7	8
Sorry about my friend. He's...	7	8
Witty.	7	8
Do I know you?	7	8
I don't think so.	7	8
She's a little old for NYU.	7	8
$11.60. You must have had a lot of hash browns, sweetheart.	7	8
Probably only eats once a week.	7	8
Let's split it five ways.	7	8
No, I think I owe someone an apology.	7	8
That ought to do it.	7	8
That's $100.	7	8
I suppose I'm gonna have to drop one of you off.	7	8
You decide who.	7	8
Don, let's go.	7	8
Yeah.	7	8
(DOOR CLOSES)	7	8
Good evening, Mr. Draper.	7	8
- Who am I speaking with? - It's Joanne.	7	8
You have four messages.	7	8
At 7:30, Laura called and said	7	8
she has a photo shoot in the morning,	7	8
so don't call after 11:00.	7	8
What time is it?	7	8
10 past, but she called again at 8:00 and said midnight was fine.	7	8
(CHUCKLES)	7	8
- What else? - 9:30, Maxine called.	7	8
She met you two weeks ago at Cosmopolitan	7	8
and remains intrigued by your proposition.	7	8
And last, at 10:00, Tricia from TWA.	7	8
She's on a layover.	7	8
- And what are you doing tonight, Joanne? - You're very funny, Mr. Draper.	7	8
Give me Tricia's number.	7	8
(DOORBELL RINGING)	7	8
So glad you could make it.	7	8
O'Hare's a mess. They canceled everything,	7	8
so it seemed to be fate.	7	8
You look ravishing.	7	8
I feel a little underdressed.	7	8
Where were you tonight?	7	8
No, it's true.	7	8
On every single flight,	7	8
there's always one blanket completely soaked in urine.	7	8
- In first class? - Oh, yes.	7	8
(TRICIA SHRIEKING)	7	8
(LAUGHING) I'm sorry.	7	8
It's your fault. You scared me.	7	8
Do you have a towel?	7	8
Don't do that.	7	8
(BOTH GIGGLING)	7	8
Another woman you're sleeping with?	7	8
No, that's the woman I'm not sleeping with. My ex-wife.	7	8
Hanes calls them L'eggs.	7	8
They're crap.	7	8
They're definitely not as high-quality as Topaz.	7	8
They're in four test markets	7	8
and they're outspending you 6-to-1.	7	8
And outselling you 20-to-1.	7	8
It's more than the packaging. It's the placement.	7	8
They're not just selling them in drugstores.	7	8
They're focusing on supermarkets.	7	8
And they're only $1.39 a pair.	7	8
So we need to lower our price and buy more ad time?	7	8
This is only a novelty, and the inferior quality	7	8
will catch up with them,	7	8
but we're recommending a change right now	7	8
while it sorts itself out.	7	8
Look, I know you think I'm cheap.	7	8
And I know you think Topaz are cheap,	7	8
although apparently not cheap enough,	7	8
but I just wanna spend money where it'll make a difference.	7	8
They got an egg. Why don't we have a topaz?	7	8
Big plastic jewel. Green.	7	8
Maybe it's see-through.	7	8
And Mr. Potato Head here can relax	7	8
'cause he'll still make his quota when we launch it.	7	8
I'd never recommend imitation as a strategy.	7	8
You'll be second, which is very far from first.	7	8
Whose fault is that?	7	8
I told you about the development of this product	7	8
and you didn't seem worried at all.	7	8
Art, Marvin, are you ready for lunch?	7	8
Yes, lam, Kenneth. We had a problem, but we solved it.	7	8
Well, that's great to hear.	7	8
What do we do?	7	8
We keep the client.	7	8
How was the party?	7	8
David Bailey wants to take your picture.	7	8
Well, I have plans tonight.	7	8
So I'll be leaving at 5:00 on the dot and I don't wanna hear about it.	7	8
Wake me in...	7	8
You have casting in an hour.	7	8
Great.	7	8
You have lunch plans?	7	8
Just coffee, if the wait's not too long.	7	8
No, I just thought, I'm going to the coffee shop,	7	8
so I could pick you up something.	7	8
Mathis, you're pouring coffee.	7	8
I wanted to ask you about something.	7	8
You want a raise? Stop acting like a secretary.	7	8
This has nothing to do with work.	7	8
My brother-in-law is in town	7	8
and I thought you could join Julie and I for dinner.	7	8
He's very handsome. The whole family is.	7	8
You're setting me up?	7	8
He has a car.	7	8
It's very sweet, but I really have to question yourjudgment.	7	8
You know, you're a catch.	7	8
Thank you, but how could you think	7	8
this has nothing to do with work?	7	8
I told my wife that,	7	8
and she said it won't matter 'cause she has a knack for this.	7	8
What happens if I take you up on this offer and it goes badly,	7	8
or he's homely or anything happens, good or bad?	7	8
Did you think about that?	7	8
No, I didn't anticipate any of this, I'll be honest with you.	7	8
I appreciate it, but no, thank you.	7	8
Tell Julie she's very thoughtful.	7	8
Are you auditioning?	7	8
I tried to arrange a meeting,	7	8
but Meredith explained how much work you have to do.	7	8
We met with Topaz and had the unpleasant conversation.	7	8
And their solution was a knockoff topaz container, green.	7	8
What was our solution?	7	8
We don't have one.	7	8
The irony is, they're being pushed out of the bottom of the market.	7	8
What's the top, department stores?	7	8
Yeah, but they're a drugstore brand. That's what Topaz is.	7	8
So they're not called Topaz anymore.	7	8
Tell them their idea for new packaging was good,	7	8
"but the new packaging should say, ""Macy's."""	7	8
That's gonna be tough	7	8
with the stores are being blown up by radicals every day.	7	8
You know these two.	7	8
People haven't stopped shopping.	7	8
So all I have to do is sign Macy's. Piece of cake.	7	8
Doesn't McCann represent Marshall Field's?	7	8
Remind them it's a two-way street.	7	8
Phil was in plastics, he's going to metals,	7	8
and Greg was in metals,	7	8
he's going to marketing and advertising,	7	8
which is my old job.	7	8
That means Tom Schaeffer is head of plastics at Dow Chemical.	7	8
Good for him.	7	8
Good for you.	7	8
Now's a good time.	7	8
He's still not up.	7	8
Never wake a sleeping baby.	7	8
I want to see him.	7	8
What's that?	7	8
We don't want you to think of this as retirement,	7	8
think of it as the beginning of your professional career.	7	8
I don't know what to say.	7	8
"You say ""Jack Nicklaus, out of my way. I've got better clubs."""	7	8
I'm very touched.	7	8
Ever since your mother passed away, I haven't really enjoyed anything.	7	8
Honestly, Ed.	7	8
He thinks he's a comedian.	7	8
I'm just glad there's something that will get him out of the house besides that boat.	7	8
Who says I'll be in the house?	7	8
I've got a lot of time to make up for.	7	8
Daddy, I'm so glad.	7	8
Most men my age have had a couple of heart attacks.	7	8
I'm still young enough to enjoy things. New things, even.	7	8
I've started cooking.	7	8
Actually made myself a... What is it, honey?	7	8
A Pop-Tart, Ed.	7	8
It was very good.	7	8
Next.	7	8
This is another girl.	7	8
Rachel?	7	8
I'm supposed to tell you, you missed your flight.	7	8
Thank you.	7	8
Rachel.	7	8
Yes?	7	8
You're not just smooth, you're Wilkinson smooth.	7	8
Back to work.	7	8
Is it morning?	7	8
No. Go back to sleep.	7	8
That's why I like surveying. You see, I'm the outdoor type.	7	8
Sorry, did I wake you?	7	8
It's okay. Did Eddie wake up again?	7	8
My dad is so old.	7	8
Don't worry about him. He is going to have a ball.	7	8
Why did he wait so long to do that?	7	8
Honey, he loved his job.	7	8
But you don't.	7	8
You're bored and angry	7	8
because you know it's not what you wanna do.	7	8
I should never tell you anything.	7	8
And I haven't gotten any writing done in a long time.	7	8
So start now.	7	8
You've done very well	7	8
and let's stop pretending like I wasn't born with plenty.	7	8
You could quit your job. We could buy that farm.	7	8
You could write your book.	7	8
What book?	7	8
Something sad and sweet.	7	8
For people who don't have the guts to live their dream.	7	8
Why don't you write a book?	7	8
You gave them your eye.	7	8
Don't give them the rest of your life.	7	8
Your father was a cog in a giant machine	7	8
that makes weapons and poison.	7	8
And you sell them.	7	8
(BABY CRYING IN BACKGROUND)	7	8
I'm proud of the company!	7	8
And if nothing else, I'd like to wait and see if I get a raise.	7	8
There's always another hurdle.	7	8
You're not listening to me at all!	7	8
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)	7	8
You're late.	7	8
It's five after.	7	8
Casting always starts on time.	7	8
Can't you smell the cheap perfume?	7	8
Can you call Rachel Katz at Menken's Department Store?	7	8
No. You know what, set a meeting. The number's in the Rolodex.	7	8
It's regarding Topaz Pantyhose.	7	8
Of course.	7	8
You're not the landing party we expected.	7	8
What can we do for you?	7	8
As I was telling David here on the phone,	7	8
L'eggs Pantyhose is an unstoppable foe	7	8
in the affordable pantyhose marketplace.	7	8
Our client, Topaz Pantyhose,	7	8
has the high quality to wear a department store name.	7	8
It is a growing and lucrative product.	7	8
In three months, L'eggs has sold a year's worth.	7	8
They're worried that L'eggs are gonna spread all over the world?	7	8
That wouldn't bother me at all.	7	8
(MEN LAUGHING)	7	8
We were hoping McCann Erickson could provide, at the minimum,	7	8
an introduction to your department store clients	7	8
so we can assess their desire for a store brand.	7	8
I know they'd be happy to meet you.	7	8
Especially Dan Higgins. He loves redheads.	7	8
Would you tell him what's so special about your panties?	7	8
The benefits are listed there,	7	8
but basically they're more sheer, softer,	7	8
and more like silk to the touch, yet still very strong.	7	8
So you can pull them down over and over?	7	8
You can wear them quite a few times	7	8
before they run or lose shape.	7	8
- Do you wear them, Joan? - I do.	7	8
If you talk to Dan, I'd start with that.	7	8
I think anyone would be equally interested	7	8
in the price-per-unit,	7	8
which could be reduced a lot if the demand were higher.	7	8
Why aren't you in the brassiere business?	7	8
Excuse me?	7	8
You should be in the bra business.	7	8
You're a work of art.	7	8
What she's saying is that wider distribution	7	8
would mean bigger ad budgets for us.	7	8
I'd set a lunch, but I think a dinner would be better.	7	8
And warm him up first.	7	8
Send a basket of pears to Marshall Field's.	7	8
The one thing Dan likes is a nice pear.	7	8
(MEN LAUGHING)	7	8
This guy. What are their billings?	7	8
If you take a look at the sheet there again.	7	8
Yeah. Give us a minute. Let's read this thing.	7	8
Where were you?	7	8
Shirley, you're not going to believe this, but I walked to work today.	7	8
Mr. Sterling and Mr. Donnelly are here.	7	8
They just walked in.	7	8
You wanted to see me?	7	8
You know Ferguson Donnelly from McCann.	7	8
- Of course. Ferg, good to see you. - Been a while.	7	8
Is this about the Topaz department store route?	7	8
I think it's a great idea.	7	8
I don't know what you're talking about.	7	8
Did you send Ed Baxter a $200 set	7	8
of MacGregor golf clubs from the firm?	7	8
Actually, I hand-delivered it. It was a retirement gift.	7	8
I've got some bad news for you. Pete's gonna take over Dow.	7	8
Because of the clubs?	7	8
No, because McCann doesn't want you on the business.	7	8
Just 'cause Ed's retiring doesn't mean	7	8
I can't get along with his replacement.	7	8
I know Greg from metals.	7	8
I don't care if you know a girl from Kalamazoo.	7	8
We don't want you on the business	7	8
because we don't want you on any business.	7	8
Look, Ferg, you're not still mad at me for leaving?	7	8
That was six years ago.	7	8
And you never hired me anyway.	7	8
When you bought Putnam, Powell & Lowe,	7	8
I came with the furniture.	7	8
People come in and out of our doors all the time, Ken,	7	8
but they don't walk out with $4 million of Birds Eye products.	7	8
Of course they do.	7	8
Fine.	7	8
They don't walk around the office like their shit doesn't stink	7	8
and then go out and tell the world we're, what,	7	8
a bunch of black Irish thugs?	7	8
You're gonna fire me because I hurt Ferg's feelings?	7	8
It's what he is. Look at him.	7	8
How about a little dignity?	7	8
You're firing me!	7	8
Yes, but you'll get a generous severance package	7	8
if you help Pete secure all of your accounts, including Dow.	7	8
Roger said he'd be glad to recommend you.	7	8
Thank you, Roger. I appreciate your loyalty.	7	8

- Should we get lunch? - I want to burn this place down.	7	8
I know. They were awful.	7	8
But at least we got a yes.	7	8
Would you have rather had a friendly no?	7	8
I don't expect you to understand.	7	8
Joan, you've never experienced that before?	7	8
Have you, P9993'?	7	8
I don't know. You can't have it both ways.	7	8
You can't dress the way you do...	7	8
How do I dress?	7	8
Look, they didn't take me seriously, either.	7	8
So what you're saying is	7	8
I don't dress the way you do because I don't look like you.	7	8
And that's very, very true.	7	8
You know what? You're filthy rich.	7	8
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.	7	8
How was the cattle call?	7	8
We have to have another session.	7	8
You're shameless, you know that?	7	8
Do I have a lunch today?	7	8
No, but you have a busy afternoon.	7	8
I scheduled a meeting next Monday	7	8
with Mr. Rosenthal at Menken's Department Store.	7	8
Mrs. Katz didn't want to meet?	7	8
Well, it was a very awkward conversation	7	8
because apparently she stepped down a few months ago	7	8
and passed away last week.	7	8
What?	7	8
Rachel Katz?	7	8
Yes.	7	8
I'm sorry to tell you that.	7	8
Last week?	7	8
I had no intention of upsetting you.	7	8
How old was she?	7	8
I don't know. Younger than me.	7	8
From the name, I just pictured some old lady.	7	8
I had no idea.	7	8
If you'd like, they've asked that in lieu of flowers,	7	8
you can send a donation to	7	8
the National Jewish Hospital at Denver.	7	8
Do you want to do that?	7	8
No. Yes, sure.	7	8
I'm going to run down and get you a sandwich.	7	8
- I'm leaving. Need anything? - No.	7	8
Mathis.	7	8
Yes?	7	8
Well, if it helps you get back into your wife's good graces,	7	8
I had a cancellation	7	8
and I'd love to join you for dinner tomorrow night.	7	8
Shoot, we already made other plans.	7	8
Oh.	7	8
Well, it wasn't meant to be.	7	8
Stevie doesn't need to come with us.	7	8
I'll sell his ticket.	7	8
- Stevie? How old is he? - I don't know, 30?	7	8
- I don't know. - Can I go?	7	8
Give him my number. Tell him to call me.	7	8

Yes, from here. The other night.	7	8
No.	7	8

- Are you okay? - I'm done.	7	8
McCann told Roger to do it, and, boy, did Roger do it.	7	8
They want me to give all my accounts to Pete.	7	8
I'm calling Jim Hobart right now. You're the head of accounts.	7	8
Do you want to hear something spooky?	7	8
Don't do anything rash, Ken. It's just a job.	7	8
No, my father-in-law retires and my wife says,	7	8
"""I want you to quit. You're wasting your life."	7	8
"""You should write that novel."""	7	8
And you know what? I think I was gonna do it.	7	8
And the very next day, they fire me.	7	8
Can you believe that?	7	8
No.	7	8
That's not a coincidence. That's a sign.	7	8

He's at McCann Erickson.	7	8
It's Dennis Ford.	7	8
Should I put him through?	7	8
No. Tell him I'm in a meeting.	7	8
So, Clara just left?	7	8
She was as big as a house.	7	8
Is Torkelson going to marry her?	7	8
He's probably just looking the other way.	7	8
People do that around here all the time.	7	8
I swear I found out after you did. It came from McCann.	7	8
So did your millions of dollars.	7	8
You know, I didn't really get millions of dollars.	7	8
I mean, eventually,	7	8
but stepped out in smaller increments	7	8
to stay under that top tax threshold.	7	8
I'll have to buy an apartment building to keep any of it,	7	8
and then I've got to be a landlord.	7	8
Sounds like a real pain in the ass.	7	8
Look, I was caught by surprise,	7	8
but I didn't know your history with McCann.	7	8
What did you do over there?	7	8
I never fit in. I'm not Irish. I'm not Catholic. I can read.	7	8

It's good you're playing ball, or you'd have no future.	7	8

You have other plans?	7	8
I may have let it go for a while,	7	8
but damned if I don't have something to write about now.	7	8
No, this world is boring.	7	8
You should write an adventure story.	7	8
Do you know how great you'll look on a book jacket?	7	8
I've thought about it.	7	8
I'm a hell of lot better at it than I ever was at this.	7	8
Good for you. I'm envious.	7	8
I thought I was changing my life when I went out to California.	7	8
Of course, now it sort of feels like a dream,	7	8
but at the time, it felt so real.	7	8
Well, that's you, I guess.	7	8
I know. Look, here I am.	7	8

you can always use my name.	7	8

I appreciate that.	7	8

This is the same as the navy one.	7	8
Don't tell Oscar de la Renta, because the navy one is $159.	7	8
I can wear boots with that.	7	8
You know what?	7	8
I'll take the boots and the tan heels,	7	8
the chiffon, the red and this one.	7	8
Didn't you used to work here?	7	8

We had dinner with the dean of Fairfield University.	7	9
 Some distant Rockefeller.	7	9
Actually, I'm planning on enrolling in the fall.	7	9
Master's degree.	7	9
Really? In what?	7	9
PsychOIOQY-	7	9
I know it's beyond your experience,	7	9
but people love to talk to me.	7	9
They seek me out to share their confidences.	7	9
It should be fascinating for everyone involved.	7	9
Oh, Hello, Don.	7	9
We're making chocolate shakes.	7	9
I should go.	7	9
Don't rush off. You can finish your milkshake.	7	9
Make Henry one.	7	9
 You give him a sip of yours.	7	9
Bye-bye.	7	9
Maybe I'll make my own.	7	9
Did you have fun?	7	9
(BLENDER WHIRRING)	7	9
(TELEPHONE RINGING)	7	9
Hello?	7	9
Oh.	7	9
You're home.	7	9
I was expecting the service.	7	9
I just walked in.	7	9
I wanted to let you know that	7	9
the movers are gonna come on Wednesday to pick up my furniture.	7	9
What time do you want me to be there?	7	9
Just tell the doorman.	7	9
We're coming at 10:00. Does that give you enough time?	7	9
You know what time I go to work.	7	9
Uh, there's one other thing. It's the 24th already.	7	9
How could you be out of money?	7	9
Oh, between the movers and the flight...	7	9
Why am I explaining myself to you?	7	9
I'm tired of asking for an allowance.	7	9
Can we sign the papers and be done?	7	9
Your lawyer's very aggressive.	7	9
That's not how I heard it.	7	9
I'm starting to think you're enjoying this.	7	9
Well, my finances are a mess since the McCann deal.	7	9
You were a millionaire when I met you.	7	9
Just tell your lawyer he won. I'll sign whatever you want.	7	9
I can't live like this.	7	9
This is what they do, honey.	7	9
How much do you need right now? I'll leave a check.	7	9
Five hundred.	7	9
Who's moving you, the New York Jets?	7	9
(SIGHS)	7	9
I have to go.	7	9
"ROGER"". I'm ready, Caroline."	7	9
What's she doing here?	7	9
It's too much. I can't do it by myself.	7	9
Well, you should have asked me.	7	9
You're too busy!	7	9
Sit down, Shirley.	7	9
Well, this morning, immediately following this,	7	9
you have a meeting with Mr. Campbell and Mr. Torkelson	7	9
regarding Lester Chapman.	7	9
Who's he?	7	9
Secor Laxatives.	7	9
I'm sorry, but actually, he's at Life Cereal.	7	9
This is working out already.	7	9
They want to set a call for 4:00.	7	9
Hold on a second. Isn't he NAC?	7	9
I'll check the Rolodex.	7	9
I'm sorry, what's NAC?	7	9
No afternoon calls. Lester's blotto after lunch.	7	9
He is indeed.	7	9
Well, let's call him now.	7	9
SO, it's 7-9-8...	7	9
This certainly is a two-man job.	7	9
So you just fly to Los Angeles for the weekend?	7	9
Isn't that tiring?	7	9
What's tiring is coming back here.	7	9
So beautiful. You should go sometime.	7	9
I don't know if I'd like it.	7	9
How do you go to sleep at night	7	9
knowing the Manson brothers could be running around?	7	9
- Good morning. - The Manson family.	7	9
- Are they coming in? - No. A quick word?	7	9
Coffee.	7	9
So, I got a strange phone call.	7	9
Well, not strange, but unexpected. Megan called me.	7	9
Really?	7	9
I guess she's coming into town and she wants to buy me a drink	7	9
to see if I can help her find a new agent.	7	9
Can you?	7	9
Of course, I can. I do it all the time.	7	9
It's just... Well, I wanted to let you know.	7	9
Been down this road before and you always find out.	7	9
(SIGHS) Because you always tell me.	7	9
Yes, but she didn't want me to.	7	9
It's never stopped you before.	7	9
So should I meet with her?	7	9
She's not my wife anymore, Harry.	7	9
(INTERCOM BUZZING)	7	9
MEREDITH: You have a call from a Nicholas Constantinopolis.	7	9
Probably Greek.	7	9
Oh, yes. I need to take this.	7	9
I'm sure that's a story.	7	9
Nicholas, it's Don.	7	9
Good evening. Can I get you something from the bar?	7	9
Or are you expecting...	7	9
Hello.	7	9
How are you?	7	9
I'm surprised.	7	9
This isn't a coincidence. I was looking for you.	7	9
What do you want?	7	9
I want to eat dinner with you.	7	9
Even if it's five minutes at a time.	7	9
No.	7	9
You're making me uncomfortable.	7	9
This is my phone number. Call me when you get off work.	7	9
I'll meet you somewhere.	7	9
I'll show you her work. You will absolutely recognize it. Ed!	7	9
All I'm saying is you dug pretty deep to find a woman.	7	9
(SIGHS) Do you know where Samantha Ryan's portfolio is?	7	9
She calls herself Pima.	7	9
Pima Ryan?	7	9
Exactly.	7	9
She came and spoke at RISD when I was there.	7	9
She's a very sexy lady.	7	9
I thought you were queer.	7	9
Where's Pima's portfolio?	7	9
I took it home. Does she want it back? Does she need it?	7	9
No, I need it. Peggy forgot this is my account, too.	7	9
We're really lucky. She's never done an ad.	7	9
Stan, I'm sorry, but you do not have any of the qualities	7	9
that either I or Cinzano are looking for other than being cheaper.	7	9
It's hard to keep my balls at this job.	7	9
Ed, what do you know about vermouth?	7	9
No.	7	9
(PHONE RINGING)	7	9
Hello?	7	9
Hello. It's Diana.	7	9
You know, the waitress.	7	9
(SIGHS AND CHUCKLES)	7	9
I'm glad you called. I didn't think you were gonna.	7	9
I don't know anybody in New York.	7	9
So strange to see somebody that I know.	7	9
I'm just pleased you're not cross.	7	9
I was pretty mad. How did you find me?	7	9
Are you a private detective? You kinda look like one.	7	9
Why don't we have a drink?	7	9
I've already got one. Let's talk now.	7	9
(SIGHS) I Waited a little,	7	9
maybe too long,	7	9
and you were gone.	7	9
So I told Nick at the diner to	7	9
let me know if you ever came back.	7	9
I went home.	7	9
Where's home?	7	9
Racine, Wisconsin.	7	9
I had to get a divorce.	7	9
(CHUCKLES)	7	9
I'm divorced.	7	9
Well, I happen to be in the same boat.	7	9
Right now I'm in the boat.	7	9
I must have known that.	7	9
Come over.	7	9
Where are you?	7	9
I'm at work.	7	9
I don't have a phone yet.	7	9
Fine, I'll come there.	7	9
Welcome.	7	9
Do you sleep like that?	7	9
I'm vain.	7	9
May I?	7	9
It's a very lovely apartment.	7	9
It's like Architectural Digest.	7	9
My, uh...	7	9
She decorated it.	7	9
It's what I pictured.	7	9
So you were picturing it?	7	9
I took a cab to some stranger's apartment with $6 in my pocket.	7	9
I was hoping it was like this.	7	9
I'm gonna sell it.	7	9
I was just apartment hunting. It's gonna be hard to beat.	7	9
Can I fix you a drink?	7	9
I don't know how I feel about getting to know you better.	7	9
It's 3:00 A.M. You know why you're here.	7	9
Do you want a drink or not?	7	9
I'm already drunk.	7	9
Would you like a glass of water?	7	9
Hey, I can't sleep like this.	7	9
You were.	7	9
I don't want to.	7	9
Do you want to go?	7	9
No.	7	9
Are you really divorced?	7	9
Yes, I am. Really. Why?	7	9
You got a lot of coats in that closet.	7	9
She lives in California. She didn't need them.	7	9
Do you want one?	7	9
I was going to go to San Francisco.	7	9
I flipped a coin.	7	9
I always wanted to live here.	7	9
It was in all the movies, all the magazines.	7	9
I haven't seen any of it.	7	9
It's a great city.	7	9
How long were you married?	7	9
Twelve years.	7	9
I don't know why I thought it'd be easy.	7	9
It's never easy.	7	9
I've been through it before. There's no children this time.	7	9
You'?	7	9
No children.	7	9
(SNIFFING) Mmm.	7	9
You smell incredible. What is that?	7	9
Shampoo.	7	9
Avon.	7	9
(SIGHS)	7	9
I bought it in my living room.	7	9
In my ranch house.	7	9
And my two-car garage.	7	9
(ALARM CLOCK BUZZING)	7	9
Diana?	7	9
They're here every other weekend.	7	9
Well, not my little girl. She's at boarding school, but the boys come.	7	9
Are you okay?	7	9
No.	7	9
What's wrong?	7	9
I lied to you.	7	9
Already?	7	9
No, I left home because I have a little girl.	7	9
I had a little girl.	7	9
Oh.	7	9
I'm so sorry.	7	9
Yes.	7	9
When?	7	9
Two years ago.	7	9
The flu. Can you imagine?	7	9
I'm so sorry.	7	9
I don't want to talk about it.	7	9
Obviously, I'm in New York City.	7	9
You should go.	7	9
It's my house.	7	9
Don't you have to get ready for work?	7	9
I don't feel like it.	7	9
DIANA: Hmm.	7	9
Gentlemen, I'm going to be strict,	7	9
but this is Torkelson's law.	7	9
Take a good look.	7	9
You got your models, you got your bottles.	7	9
If you make it to lunch without bothering anybody,	7	9
we'll let you have whichever you want.	7	9
(MEN LAUGHING)	7	9
Ah! Well, if you'll all excuse me.	7	9
Come on, I'll introduce you.	7	9
Pima Ryan, this is our art director Stan Rizzo.	7	9
So you'll be cutting up my work, will you?	7	9
Well, I try to treat it like art	7	9
even though it's just selling something.	7	9
All art is selling something.	7	9
No, we're actually selling something.	7	9
Today, it's vermouth.	7	9
I apologize the models have so many teeth.	7	9
I know you're not used to that.	7	9
Pleasure to meet you.	7	9
I'm sorry about that. He has a hard time with	7	9
new people.	7	9
No, he hates himself.	7	9
(CHUCKLES)	7	9
I don't think so. He's got a huge ego.	7	9
And he's a photographer.	7	9
Ah.	7	9
Men like him don't bother me,	7	9
and they shouldn't bother you either.	7	9
Look at all you're doing here.	7	9
(STAMMERING) It's just my job.	7	9
Good morning, girls.	7	9
Could you take your places?	7	9
- Good morning. - It's 11:30.	7	9
Where were you? I was worried.	7	9
I was sleepy.	7	9
Mr. Sterling's in there. He's not to be disturbed.	7	9
Who are you hiding from?	7	9
I got two secretaries and three telephones.	7	9
I feel like Marlin Perkins is chasing me on the savannah.	7	9
Hiding is pointless.	7	9
I've got work to do.	7	9
That's the other reason I'm here.	7	9
McCann represents Derby Foods. Peter Pan Peanut Butter.	7	9
They're making a cookie.	7	9
Sounds delicious.	7	9
McCann also represents Nabisco. National Biscuit Company.	7	9
"They got the word ""cookie"" in their name."	7	9
No, they don't.	7	9
Do we have a shot at Derby?	7	9
No, it's just a cookie.	7	9
McCann's clients are our clients. We're helping out.	7	9
You and Peter are taking them golfing tomorrow.	7	9
I can't make it.	7	9
(INTERCOM BUZZING)	7	9
MEREDITH: There's a messenger here from your attorney's office.	7	9
He needs your signature.	7	9
Since when can't you go golfing?	7	9
Since Burt Peterson's the account man.	7	9
Good news or bad news?	7	9
Good news. It's almost over.	7	9
Well, don't settle until you get the number you want.	7	9
Take it from me, no matter what she says, you have given her the good life.	7	9
She'd never have had it.	7	9
Megan is not Jane.	7	9
So she never said you squandered her youth and beauty?	7	9
Used up her childbearing years?	7	9
Thwarted her career? What career?	7	9
- She's a consumer. - (INTERCOM BUZZING)	7	9
MEREDITH: Mr. Sterling, are you still at lunch? They're wondering.	7	9
She made her choices.	7	9
(DOOR CLOSING)	7	9
You're very good.	7	9
(SIGHS)	7	9
Can I help you?	7	9
Well, I've been told that my negatives belong to the agency	7	9
and therefore processing has to be done at your lab.	7	9
I'm not comfortable with that.	7	9
I hate to break it to you,	7	9
but it's not really yours anymore.	7	9
Don't you have a darkroom here?	7	9
Yes, but I can't do that.	7	9
I started off as a clerk with a newspaper in Sarasota.	7	9
All I wanted was to get in that darkroom.	7	9
It's a nice thing to have, especially in the city.	7	9
So, you're a photographer.	7	9
I do everything.	7	9
I'm an art director.	7	9
You must show me your work.	7	9
I don't know.	7	9
I can feel the tension of your need for my opinion.	7	9
I wouldn't mind you taking a look	7	9
if you promise to be honest.	7	9
Let's see how brave you are.	7	9
Hello? Mother? Marie-France?	7	9

I'm not changing rooms.	7	9
Well, she's made plans for us.	7	9

Absolutely not. This isn't a vacation.	7	9

Good night.	7	9
Don, we should play squash sometime.	7	9
You know, if you have the energy.	7	9
- Arnold! - Sounds like fun.	7	9
How many girls have you had in this elevator?	7	9
That's not what that was.	7	9
Hello?	7	9
(SCOFFS)	7	9
I said hello. You didn't even grunt.	7	9
(GRUNTS)	7	9
Are you in a creative mood or a bad mood?	7	9
I don't know what I'm doing.	7	9
Everything good I have is from a long time ago.	7	9
So what? You think Picasso looks at Guernica and says,	7	9
"""lgnore that. It was a long time ago?"""	7	9
I got nothing to show her.	7	9
Who cares about her?	7	9
You should see what she does.	7	9
It's so sensual.	7	9
Get your camera.	7	9
Why?	7	9
I want you to take my picture.	7	9
No, you don't.	7	9
No touching the model.	7	9
In here?	7	9
Well, I'm not going outside.	7	9
You must sit out there all the time.	7	9
I wanna see where you live.	7	9
How could I be nervous at this point?	7	9
I know.	7	9
There's a twinge in my chest.	7	9
A Pain?	7	9
No, it's not that. I'm positive.	7	9
Are you hungry?	7	9
Not really.	7	9

Of course.	7	9
Yes.	7	9
Thank you, Meredith.	7	9

Uh, yeah.	7	9
We have to get out of here.	7	9
She's coming to take her things and I don't want to be here.	7	9
Oh.	7	9
- Okay. - No, look.	7	9
What?	7	9
I think if I were you,	7	9
this would bother me,	7	9
and it shouldn't	7	9
because it's almost over.	7	9
Good.	7	9
I want to see you tonight.	7	9
At my place, okay?	7	9
Let's go.	7	9
Shit.	7	9
We'll swing by your place on the way.	7	9
I'll rent.	7	9
You're going to rent pants?	7	9
I'll throw my tie over my shoulder, and roll up my sleeves.	7	9

In the States, it's the 20th century.	7	9
People get divorced all the time.	7	9
Exactly. You can still get an annulment.	7	9
I'm not like you.	7	9
I don't spend my whole life feeling ashamed.	7	9
Marie-France, don't be a bitch.	7	9
I am not a servant here to wait on her	7	9
while she goes for lunch.	7	9
I know you don't understand this,	7	9
but it's for my career.	7	9
Good luck with your bright future.	7	9
Wait.	7	9

No.	7	9
It's not much. It's just the boxes,	7	9
Granny's cabinet, that chair, and the mirror.	7	9
Go. Have fun. I'll take care of this.	7	9
Hey, where's everybody going?	7	9
Oh, my mother's here. Thank you so much.	7	9
Do you have to smoke in here?	7	9
It's taking my mind off your driving.	7	9
I don't know why we couldn't swing by your apartment?	7	9
What will the clients think? That you're renting clubs?	7	9
I'll buy a set in the shop.	7	9
Megan's moving her things today.	7	9

I didn't know that was still going on.	7	9
They want to punish you.	7	9
And then you get mad and you want to punish them,	7	9
but you know it's your fault.	7	9
I've been through it before.	7	9
How did you handle client dinners?	7	9
I got a date.	7	9
I don't have a steady, so it's too unpredictable.	7	9
You don't know how much they're going to drink	7	9
and suddenly you're with a floozy.	7	9
Golf is better.	7	9
Jiminy Christmas.	7	9
You think you're going to begin your life over and do it right,	7	9
but what if you never get past the beginning again?	7	9
Watch the road.	7	9

You filled the whole truck, that wasn't what we agreed.	7	9
I told you it was gonna be more.	7	9
More than double?	7	9
- Fine, how much you got? - I have $350.	7	9
That's enough for me to leave it on the sidewalk.	7	9

Don't. I'm not ready.	7	9
Your subject certainly is.	7	9
Oh, that's Elaine. She's, uh...	7	9
Overdeveloped?	7	9
She's not worthy of you.	7	9
You can see it in her eyes.	7	9
She doesn't want to tell you the truth.	7	9
Drawing is a much more rare talent.	7	9
Oh.	7	9
I expected more.	7	9
- Holy shit. - What?	7	9
- Where is everything? - On the truck.	7	9
Pay him.	7	9
One hundred and eighty bucks.	7	9
My pleasure.	7	9
Don agreed to this?	7	9
He was very generous.	7	9
And you are a true gentleman.	7	9
Uh-huh.	7	9
Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a drink.	7	9
I hate what he did to my daughter.	7	9
Mon Dieu, I'm trembling.	7	9
You really are. It's okay.	7	9
What are you doing?	7	9
You already emptied the place. You wanna defile it as well?	7	9
Please.	7	9
Take advantage of me.	7	9
- You look ravishing. - Thank you.	7	9
I'm really sorry I'm late. You know that office.	7	9
- Should we get some wine? - I already did.	7	9
I am certainly picking up the check.	7	9
I insist.	7	9
It's just, you had such good advice for Miranda and Jill.	7	9
Well, they didn't have agents at all. My advice was get one.	7	9
(CHUCKLES) Well, whatever you did.	7	9
To whatever I did.	7	9
So, give me the lay.	7	9
You know, of the land.	7	9
There's not much to tell.	7	9
I haven't booked anything in the last few months.	7	9
Not even pilot season?	7	9
Well, I turned down some smaller parts because	7	9
Alan thought they'd take me out of the running for leads.	7	9
I'm not in his business,	7	9
but I find it hard to believe that you're losing any contest.	7	9
I bet he doesn't know how to get you in one.	7	9
I read all the time, Harry.	7	9
Do you read for lead parts?	7	9
That's just getting your name on the right list	7	9
with the right casting director.	7	9
Good agents with real track records can make that happen.	7	9
Alan represents Angie Dickinson.	7	9
You are every man's fantasy.	7	9
You're like Ali MacGraw and Brigitte Bardot had a baby.	7	9
You should be the most famous person in the world right now.	7	9
Oh, my goodness!	7	9
You should be in this business.	7	9
I can't believe Don threw you away.	7	9
He's not a loyal person, but I am.	7	9
You don't think he could have helped you?	7	9
I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.	7	9
It would be much appreciated.	7	9
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not hungry.	7	9
I'd rather get to work on this immediately.	7	9
Well, we can work and eat. I have a pen.	7	9
Well, I have a room upstairs.	7	9
It has a phone. I could make some calls.	7	9
Harry.	7	9
I'm not interested.	7	9
Megan, you're a big girl.	7	9
Maybe you're in this situation	7	9
because of how you're reacting to this.	7	9
Hold on. Forget all that.	7	9
Come on. Have another glass of wine.	7	9
Caroline, I was busy, okay?	7	9
Now, how about at least giving me a pat on the back for remembering I had a meeting?	7	9
- (DOOR OPENING) - Hello?	7	9
What are you doing here, Megan?	7	9
Where the fuck is everything?	7	9
Roger...	7	9
(GASPS)	7	9
(SPEAKING FRENCH)	7	9
He came to help me.	7	9
I should go.	7	9
Why are you here? I told you to go to the hotel.	7	9
I felt guilty that I left you here, but obviously...	7	9
I'm late for a meeting.	7	9
I guess you don't care that she's married to my father.	7	9
It wasn't my idea.	7	9
You don't get to stand in judgment of me.	7	9
(DOOR SLAMMING)	7	9
Could you give us a second, honey?	7	9
No, thank you. Have you spoken with Megan?	7	9
I just walked in.	7	9
Well, I think I should warn you.	7	9
We had lunch and, uh,	7	9
she's not stable, Don.	7	9
She said a lot of crazy things and I'm sure will continue to say them.	7	9
And what will she say about you?	7	9
Crazy things. You know, all I can say is she really wants a job.	7	9
What does that mean?	7	9
Don, come on, nothing happened. You know she hates me.	7	9
You know what? It's none of my business.	7	9
Well, I don't think I could have helped her anyway.	7	9
She quit her soap and left New York. It was a really dumb idea.	7	9
Pima?	7	9
Could you come in? I have the selects.	7	9
(CLEARS THROAT)	7	9
Could you get the door?	7	9
I put the ones that I like best on the top row here.	7	9
I like this one,	7	9
but Stan doesn't.	7	9
Stan already showed these to you?	7	9
He was eager to share,	7	9
but he knows nothing about women.	7	9
What does that mean?	7	9
It was just his opinion.	7	9
Well, mine's the only opinion that matters here. It's my account.	7	9
Of course, you're in charge. I know that.	7	9
Which one do you like?	7	9
I think number three. Top row.	7	9
You've never been married.	7	9
Nope.	7	9
Me either.	7	9
The adventures I would have missed.	7	9
Number four.	7	9
I would love to take your picture.	7	9
(STAMMERING) Oh, I...	7	9
I don't know about that.	7	9
The way you're looking at me right now...	7	9
I would capture that.	7	9
How are you?	7	9
Where is he? He was right behind me.	7	9
I don't want anything of yours.	7	9
I wasn't going to say a word.	7	9
I wasn't gonna give you the satisfaction	7	9
of knowing that you ruined my life.	7	9
Megan.	7	9
Why did I believe you?	7	9
Why did I believe the things you said to me?	7	9
Why am I being punished for being young?	7	9
I gave up everything for you because I believed you...	7	9
And you're nothing but a liar.	7	9
An aging, sloppy, selfish liar.	7	9
You're right.	7	9
(SCOFFS) You're gonna write me a check?	7	9
I want you to have	7	9
the life you deserve.	7	9
(SCOFFS)	7	9
Are you kidding me?	7	9
No.	7	9
A million dollars?	7	9
Why are you doing this to me? It's not funny.	7	9
I don't want to fight anymore.	7	9
Well, I know it's not real.	7	9
Nothing about you is.	7	9
It is real.	7	9
Please take it.	7	9
Megan, I'm sorry.	7	9
Send me the papers.	7	9
I want you to be honest.	7	9
Should I let my hair grow out?	7	9
Good night, everybody. Ed, you were right.	7	9
Pima's a treasure.	7	9
Is she?	7	9
You don't like the work?	7	9
Because I was thinking, you know, she'd be right for Butler shoes.	7	9
Or maybe Topaz pantyhose.	7	9
She's got a thing for legs.	7	9
Women's legs.	7	9
Sorry to disappoint you.	7	9
I'm not disappointed.	7	9
Neither was she.	7	9
Really?	7	9
Does that bother you?	7	9
No,	7	9
But I bet it might bother Ellen.	7	9
Elaine.	7	9
This is none of your business.	7	9
No.	7	9
It's Pima's business,	7	9
which turns out to be more advertising than art.	7	9
She's a hustler.	7	9
You're jealous.	7	9
She tried the same thing with me,	7	9
but she didn't get as far.	7	9
And that's why I'm not going to give her another job.	7	9
I don't believe you.	7	9
Which part?	7	9
(SPEAKING FRENCH)	7	9
Not particularly.	7	9
So you ordered room service?	7	9
I don't care.	7	9
She's leaving Papa.	7	9
I'm going to pack.	7	9
I don't want to hear about it.	7	9
You know it's a sin to be a ghoul	7	9
and feed on everyone's pain?	7	9
She's been very unhappy for a very long time.	7	9
At least she did something about it.	7	9
I'm exhausted.	7	9
Me, too.	7	9
Did you print anything?	7	9
They're drying-	7	9
You did?	7	9
How were they? What did Pima say?	7	9
She loved them.	7	9
How about you?	7	9
(SIGHS)	7	9
Do you want a drink? I just have vodka.	7	9
Yes, please.	7	9
Oh...	7	9
I got you something.	7	9
Open it.	7	9
It's a New York City guidebook. Finally start your tour.	7	9
Go on.	7	9
Can't you see I don't want anything?	7	9
Look, I'm pretty sure I had a worse day than you.	7	9
Please don't be in a mood.	7	9
I'm not in a mood.	7	9
And you've never had a worse day than me.	7	9
You don't think I've felt grief?	7	9
You knew that about me the first night we met.	7	9
I've been trying to talk myself out of it.	7	9
Don't.	7	9
No.	7	9
Talk myself out of what I have to say.	7	9
You're scared. I understand.	7	9
But I took care of everything today.	7	9
I've been separated a long time.	7	9
You're not	7	9
the first thing to come along.	7	9
I'm ready.	7	9
You're fooling yourself if you think this'll make a difference.	7	9
You don't think I know what's going on here?	7	9
Look at this dump.	7	9
I know you think you deserve this.	7	9
I've done it.	7	9
I left my daughter.	7	9
Stop blaming yourself.	7	9
No.	7	9
I had two children. Two girls.	7	9
One died and one...	7	9
My oldest is in Racine with her father.	7	9
Why? Don't you want to ask why?	7	9
No.	7	9
I told you about my heart.	7	9
I don't want to feel anything else.	7	9
When I was with you, I forgot about	7	9
her.	7	9
I don't ever want to do that.	7	9
(DIANA SIGHS)	7	9
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)	7	10
Hello?	7	10
(KEYS JINGLING)	7	10
Don.	7	10
Don.	7	10
Draper!	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
Oh. (SIGHS) Melanie. I'm sorry. I must have overslept.	7	10
They're coming before work.	7	10
I told your service, but you never called me back.	7	10
There's no time for a shower.	7	10
 I'll make the bed.	7	10
I thought you were having the carpets cleaned?	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
I did.	7	10
I find it hard to believe I have to replace it to sell this place.	7	10
Couldn't you rent a couple of pieces?	7	10
It's so lonely.	7	10
It's better.	7	10
They can imagine their own things in it.	7	10
Have you ever sold an apartment?	7	10
I've sold a lot uglier things than this.	7	10
Can you go?	7	10
Don't want you crossing paths.	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
 Good luck.	7	10
(TELEPHONE RINGING)	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
Hello?	7	10
Yes, I'll accept the charges.	7	10
Hello?	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
Yes, Mom, you woke me.	7	10
I don't know. I'm not due at the office yet.	7	10
Los Angeles is three hours earlier. It's simple subtraction.	7	10
I want to talk to him, too.	7	10
Well, hello, sweetie.	7	10
Do you know how much I miss you?	7	10
What did you and Grandma Gail do this morning?	7	10
Hello?	7	10
Hello?	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
Room service, please.	7	10
I'd like a glass of skim milk,	7	10
a grapefruit, and a pot of coffee.	7	10
And some French toast.	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
You wanted to see me?	7	10
Come in. Have a seat.	7	10
Can I offer you something? A pad and pen perhaps?	7	10
You know, I could have you killed	7	10
for drinking anything but a Coke around here.	7	10
To whom it may concern?	7	10
Our benevolent overlords at McCann have invited	7	10
select presidents of select subsidiaries	7	10
to a godless retreat in the Bahamas.	7	10
So, you have to make a speech.	7	10
That's what I thought, I figured it'll be like a toast, you know?	7	10
I'm good at that.	7	10
Apparently, Caroline looked at the fine print	7	10
and they're expecting some sort of written statement	7	10
on the future of this company.	7	10
Twenty-five hundred words.	7	10
When?	7	10
By Monday. Plenty of time.	7	10
Harry's writing a manifesto on the computer.	7	10
Chaough's doing performance reviews.	7	10
And they need to finish with a nice Gettysburg Address-type speech	7	10
- that tells them where we'll be next year. - (INTERCOM BUZZES)	7	10
CAROLINE: Mr. Sterling, there's a call for you on line three.	7	10
Gettysburg Address. Got it.	7	10
I'd do it myself, but one of us is very busy.	7	10
You're going to the Bahamas.	7	10
I'm sorry. How are you doing?	7	10
Never been better.	7	10
Well, you've looked better. You want me to get my barber in here?	7	10
Anything else?	7	10
Here are the specs.	7	10
Just reasonable hopes and dreams.	7	10
Doesn't have to be science fiction.	7	10
- (INTERCOM BUZZES) - CAROLINE: Roger?	7	10
You must be Dee.	7	10
What a pleasure to meet you in the flesh. (CHUCKLES)	7	10
Top of the morning. How was your trip?	7	10
So far so good.	7	10
How about that sun?	7	10
Yes.	7	10
Have you been to California before?	7	10
Listen, I've got to run an errand. I'll be back.	7	10
First appointment is at noon.	7	10
Did we have a cancellation?	7	10
You're interviewing people who already have jobs.	7	10
They have to sneak out. It's lunch or breakfast.	7	10
Well, I thought we could rank the candidates in advance.	7	10
Come on, I did it, you did it.	7	10
No need to do it together.	7	10
Santa Monica or Sunset?	7	10
Sunset to Highland to Cahuenga.	7	10
Why don't you show me around?	7	10
How is the Beverly Wilshire? Have you seen Warren Beatty?	7	10
Not yet.	7	10
More money, bigger accounts, more awards,	7	10
international business...	7	10
and a space station?	7	10
Gas station.	7	10
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?	7	10
Do you have my thesaurus?	7	10
Probably.	7	10
Listen, you need to sign off on the Peter Pan cookie.	7	10
- He's very busy. - Stay out of this.	7	10
We can't take it out without you signing off on it and you know it.	7	10
Let's go.	7	10
You need me to set it up?	7	10
No, just broad strokes.	7	10
Peter Pan's best friend is Tinker Bell.	7	10
That's why his delicious cookie is named after her.	7	10
"We have ""Dear John"" letters in children's handwriting"	7	10
with kid voice-over explaining why they've left the competitors	7	10
for the unique taste of Tinker Bell Cookies,	7	10
made with real Peter Pan Peanut Butter.	7	10
Each letter has a little joke about the competition.	7	10
"(HIGH VOICE) ""Dear Nilla Wafers, it's so plain it's over. Susie."""	7	10
"""Dear Oreos, don't split apart, I love another."""	7	10
"""Dear Chips Ahoy, I hope..."""	7	10
Okay, I get it.	7	10
And then a cartoon touch of the wand on the cookie. A sparkle.	7	10
"""Peter Pan Peanut Butter lovers"	7	10
"""love Tinker Bell Cookies more than all others."""	7	10
Jesus, love again?	7	10
We use it all the time.	7	10
(SIGHS) Kids won't get it and adults won't hear it.	7	10
It's not up for debate. Do you have another line?	7	10
"""One Tink and you're hooked."""	7	10
What's wrong with that?	7	10
I was worried.	7	10
"How will they know ""Tink"" is Tinker Bell?"	7	10
Because you're going to tell them five times in 60 seconds.	7	10
Are we still going to be ready?	7	10
Yeah. That's why we had this meeting.	7	10
Jim McCloud is gonna be here any minute. Where's Lou?	7	10
He called. He's running late.	7	10
He called? From where?	7	10
Don't be mad at him.	7	10
He's working on something very big.	7	10
What?	7	10
Between us...	7	10
Hanna-Barbera.	7	10
The cartoon studio?	7	10
Yes. They're very interested in this comic he created.	7	10
It's like Gomer Pyle,	7	10
but he's a monkey.	7	10
How long has this been going on?	7	10
Since he was in the army. I think he misses it.	7	10
- That's not what I meant. - (KNOCK ON DOOR)	7	10
Hello. How are you? You must be Mr. McCloud.	7	10
Yes. Yes, I am.	7	10
And you are?	7	10
I'm Joan Harris.	7	10
I'm an account executive and a partner.	7	10
Mr. Avery is stuck in traffic, but I suppose we can begin.	7	10
I'm sorry.	7	10
Dee, would you offer Mr. McCloud some coffee?	7	10
Please.	7	10
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.	7	10
I was catching up with Jim here.	7	10
Jim McCloud, Joan Harris.	7	10
It's a pleasure to meet you.	7	10
Pleasure's mine.	7	10
Jim, come on in. Take a load off.	7	10
Dee, can you get me a Sanka?	7	10
Who are you?	7	10
Richard Burghoff.	7	10
I'm looking for my optometrist.	7	10
Why didn't you say so?	7	10
A woman like you wants to talk to me,	7	10
I'm a little nearsighted, I'm not blind.	7	10
Have dinner with me.	7	10
I don't know.	7	10
I want to see if I can get the job.	7	10
LOU: Joan, are you coming or not?	7	10
I have to go.	7	10
French?	7	10
Why am I signing these now?	7	10
Because you sign it again when they cash it.	7	10
That's how they know it's you.	7	10
But anyone who steals this could copy my signature too.	7	10
They have it worked out, Sally.	7	10
Why are you snapping at me? This trip was your idea.	7	10
I'm going to miss you.	7	10
You should really talk to them about Colonial Williamsburg.	7	10
You're driving right by it.	7	10
It's 12 states in 12 days. They can't stop everywhere.	7	10
Well, when I did the trip, it was six states.	7	10
Weren't they still colonies?	7	10
We got into a little bit of trouble	7	10
and I want you to know that's to be expected.	7	10
Trouble? Really?	7	10
You know, staying up all night.	7	10
We would try and break all the light bulbs	7	10
in the hallway at every hotel.	7	10
We're not going to do that.	7	10
Well...	7	10
There are going to be boys everywhere	7	10
and you're going to be away from home.	7	10
So (INHALES DEEPLY)	7	10
I hope you have the good sense	7	10
to not act like you've been let out of a cage.	7	10
I'm sorry, Mother,	7	10
but this conversation is a little late.	7	10
And so am l.	7	10
Everything is a joke to you.	7	10
- How'd it go? - About how I expected.	7	10
They loved the lobby, but the emptiness is a problem.	7	10
There's other ways to sell things.	7	10
I'm using everything I have,	7	10
but this requires too much imagination.	7	10
That's the best opportunity in the world.	7	10
Who's your best prospect?	7	10
It was a young stockbroker from New Jersey	7	10
with a 4-year-old and one on the way.	7	10
Why don't you tell them somebody lived here	7	10
who made a million dollars inventing the Frisbee.	7	10
And they had to move in a hurry to a castle in France. Taxes.	7	10
A little glamour, a little hope.	7	10
I'm not a magician.	7	10
I have to show it to people with their eyes open.	7	10
And you know what it looks like?	7	10
It looks like a sad person lives here.	7	10
And what happened to him?	7	10
He got divorced, spilled wine on the carpeting,	7	10
and didn't care enough to replace it, even for himself.	7	10
Don't blame your failure on me.	7	10
This place reeks of failure.	7	10
It is an $85,000 fixer-upper.	7	10
A lot of wonderful things happened here.	7	10
Well, you wouldn't know it.	7	10
I have a good feeling about things.	7	10
See you tomorrow.	7	10
You know I have a very early flight.	7	10
- You are not going anywhere. - (LAUGHS)	7	10
I'm serious.	7	10
Joan, I've been in prison for five years.	7	10
- You're acting like it. - (CHUCKLES)	7	10
Here's the plan.	7	10
First, I'm gonna kiss you.	7	10
I know the rest of this...	7	10
Then you're gonna cancel your flight.	7	10
Then I'm gonna drive you up to Malibu for lobster	7	10
in one of those tourist traps	7	10
where everyone's getting engaged.	7	10
Then on up to the Biltmore in Santa Barbara	7	10
where I'll sit on a lounge chair,	7	10
and watch you get in and out of the pool.	7	10
Richard, that sounds wonderful.	7	10
But I have someplace to be.	7	10
And I'm sure you do as well.	7	10
- I told you, I'm retired. - Yes.	7	10
And you were a millionaire developer.	7	10
You must think I just fell off a truck.	7	10
(CHUCKLES)	7	10
Are you a movie producer as well?	7	10
- No. - (LAUGHS)	7	10
But the rest of it is the truth, honey.	7	10
What is the rest of it?	7	10
I guess we've been dancing around this all night.	7	10
I'm divorced.	7	10
You'?	7	10
You think I would be doing this if I was married?	7	10
Have you ever been married?	7	10
Yes.	7	10
Boy, did he blow it.	7	10
He did.	7	10
(BOTH LAUGH)	7	10
Twenty-two years.	7	10
I stayed in it for the kids.	7	10
And when my youngest graduated,	7	10
I saw her heading off to Europe and I thought,	7	10
"""Jeez,"	7	10
"""that looks good."""	7	10
I mean, hell, I built something. I built a lot of things.	7	10
But I also put off a lot of things.	7	10
And now I'm free. As a bird.	7	10
I need to work.	7	10
So you have mouths to feed?	7	10
No.	7	10
I just finally got the job I've always wanted.	7	10
So you're just an executive on a trip out of town.	7	10
I'll send you flowers.	7	10
(LAUGHS)	7	10
Good morning, Meredith.	7	10
Mr. Sterling came by for your prognostication.	7	10
I told him you were at the library.	7	10
Not a bad idea.	7	10
And can you dig up the press release from when we started SCDP?	7	10
That would be December '63.	7	10
Coffee?	7	10
Good morning, Don.	7	10
No. I'll get it.	7	10
(DOOR KNOCKS AND OPENS)	7	10
Meredith got me two of these. I only need one.	7	10
Sure.	7	10
When are you casting St. Joseph's?	7	10
Two weeks. Did you meet someone we should see?	7	10
No, just organizing my schedule.	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
You ever feel like there's less to actually do, but more to think about?	7	10
Not really.	7	10
Maybe I'm a bad manager.	7	10
Maybe I'm too...	7	10
What do they call it? Hands-on.	7	10
So, going to this casting session. What's next?	7	10
Shoot the ad?	7	10
No.	7	10
What's the future going to bring?	7	10
I mean, it's good as it is, but is there a scenario in which it's better?	7	10
You're incredible.	7	10
You know, Roger asked me to do that first.	7	10
(CHUCKLES)	7	10
How'd you get out of it?	7	10
I thought about it a little and then I realized	7	10
you're so much better at painting a picture.	7	10
So, you did have thoughts.	7	10
Sure.	7	10
We'll have an oil company. You know, maybe Goodyear Tires.	7	10
We know so much about cars.	7	10
That's your dream?	7	10
No, I mean,	7	10
obviously I'd like to one day...	7	10
I don't know.	7	10
What?	7	10
I'd really love to	7	10
land a pharmaceutical.	7	10
Bigger accounts?	7	10
That's your greatest desire?	7	10
That's why I'm doing the performance reviews.	7	10
(SIGHS DEEPLY)	7	10
You know, before McCann, all I ever thought of	7	10
was will we be in business next year?	7	10
Or will I be here at all?	7	10
Now, it could be anything.	7	10
(SIGHS)	7	10
(INTERCOM BUZZES)	7	10
WOMAN: I have a Richard Burghoff on the line.	7	10
I'll take it.	7	10
Hello.	7	10
Well, your story checks out.	7	10
(LAUGHS)	7	10
It's nice to hear from you.	7	10
How are things in paradise?	7	10
I don't know. I'm in town.	7	10
What? You're in New York?	7	10
Tell me where we're eating.	7	10
The Oak Room, 7:30.	7	10
Should I pick you up at work or at home?	7	10
I'll see you there.	7	10
Well, good. You can make an entrance.	7	10
- There you are. - There you are.	7	10
We have a peanut butter cookie problem.	7	10
PEGGY: Don, don't listen to him.	7	10
Pete, what are you doing?	7	10
The client hated the layout.	7	10
Exactly, that's the problem.	7	10
And then Mathis and Ed turned on each other.	7	10
"There was some kind of ""I told you so"" exchange,"	7	10
which was already unbearably inappropriate.	7	10
And then Mathis said...	7	10

Nobody's getting fired. You have to send those idiots back in.	7	10
Absolutely not!	7	10
If you send someone new, it looks like we're starting over.	7	10

It's Loretta.	7	10

You mean Mrs. Francis.	7	10

I was in the neighborhood.	7	10
You know, Betty's home.	7	10
I don't care. I just wanted to see you.	7	10
See? You survived finals.	7	10
How's your summer?	7	10
I'm going on a teen tour.	7	10

Hey there. Could you get me a map to the powder room?	7	10
Uh, first door on the left.	7	10
BETTY: Hello.	7	10
You have a lovely home.	7	10
Sally, I didn't know you had guests.	7	10
We just dropped by.	7	10
We were on our way to Playland	7	10
and thought maybe you'd want to come.	7	10
Aren't you going to introduce me?	7	10
I'm Glen Bishop. We lived up the street in Ossining.	7	10
Glen?	7	10
My goodness. How old are you?	7	10
Eighteen.	7	10
So, you two have stayed in touch?	7	10
- Yeah. - We've been pen pals.	7	10
What have you been doing with yourself?	7	10
(LAUGHS) You look so different.	7	10
You look exactly the same.	7	10
Good, you found my backpack.	7	10
Yes, it was in the storage room.	7	10
Oh, you must be in school.	7	10
Yeah, just finished my freshman year up at Purchase.	7	10
That's supposed to be very good.	7	10
I'm actually going back to school myself this fall.	7	10
Very cool.	7	10
Can I have some actual money to take to Playland?	7	10
What? Of course. Go get my pocketbook.	7	10
Can't you?	7	10
Hey. Sorry for running past you.	7	10
My mother hates that. Just really had to go.	7	10
That's quite all right.	7	10
Can I offer you all something to drink?	7	10
- Iced tea? - No.	7	10
- I'd take a beer if you got one. - Of course.	7	10
Hold on. I thought we were going to Playland. Are you coming?	7	10
I'd love to go with you, but I don't have any money.	7	10

I feel like I should say a more formal goodbye.	7	10
Nonsense. You're welcome here anytime.	7	10
No. It's just that	7	10
I'm shipping out next week.	7	10

No.	7	10

I don't expect you to understand.	7	10

What about Kent State? You were crying.	7	10
You were gonna join the movement.	7	10
What about a bunch of Negro kids dying	7	10
while we just sit at home getting stoned?	7	10
- It's immoral. - Was this your idea?	7	10
We just met.	7	10
You're gonna die. For what?	7	10
Don't listen to Jane Fonda here.	7	10
It's a very brave thing to do.	7	10
SALLY: You know what?	7	10
Have fun at Playland.	7	10
Just remember those kids are the same age	7	10
as the ones you're going to be murdering in Vietnam.	7	10

Just wanted to thank you for fighting for me.	7	10
Who told you that?	7	10
Should we open it?	7	10
I'm set.	7	10
I appreciate your confidence in me.	7	10
What do you want?	7	10
I want you to come to the meeting.	7	10
No.	7	10
You have to make this right yourself.	7	10
How? I mean, do I apologize to them?	7	10
Do I apologize to Ed?	7	10
Do I slam my hand in the door over and over?	7	10
I once interrupted the client	7	10
during a presentation for Lucky Strike, our biggest account.	7	10
- What did you say? - I wasn't supposed to talk at all.	7	10
(CHUCKLES)	7	10
I knew if I apologized, they'd never wanna work with me again.	7	10
Why?	7	10
Do I really have to explain that?	7	10
Not if you don't want to.	7	10
So the next meeting, I walked in, shook Lee Garner's hand and said,	7	10
"""I can't believe you have the balls"	7	10
"""to come back after you embarrassed yourself like that."""	7	10

Tell me the truth. Are you married?	7	10
No.	7	10
Please don't lie to me.	7	10
I have a little boy.	7	10
Oh.	7	10

Yes, I'm fine. Um...	7	10
When do you expect him back?	7	10
But I'm going out of town tomorrow	7	10

Yes.	7	10

One at 7:00 from Tricia Reynolds	7	11
and two from Diana Baur at 9:00 and 9:30.	7	11
Diana Baur? What's the message?	7	11
I'm sorry, what was the message?	7	11
Actually, I see here.	7	11
I wasn't supposed to give you her second message.	7	11
Or her first.	7	11
My goodness. Why don't they just throw these out?	7	11
Do you know who spoke with her?	7	11
Yes, and I'll report this. I work with birdbrains.	7	11
No, it's fine. I just...	7	11
Did she leave a number?	7	11
No. I'm sorry.	7	11
(sighs)	7	11
Will you let everyone know I'll pick up my own calls tonight?	7	11
Yes, of course.	7	11
And again, I apologize, Mr. Draper.	7	11
Good night.	7	11
Caroline!	7	11
Do you read the mail or do you just open it?	7	11
Shirley opened the mail. I'll get her.	7	11
No, go get whoever is responsible for paying our lease.	7	11
Dawn Chambers.	7	11
Joan!	7	11
Get in here!	7	11
Joan!	7	11
Don't do that.	7	11
You're gonna have to fire Dawn.	7	11
She didn't pay the lease.	7	11
I'll take care of this.	7	11
(elevator bell dings)	7	11
- (intercom buzzes) - I have Trudy Campbell.	7	11
Well, hello, Trudy. How are you?	7	11
Frankly, not good at all.	7	11
What did I do?	7	11
No, it's Tammy.	7	11
She was on the wait list at Greenwich Country Day	7	11
and they promised her admission, but they didn't keep their word.	7	11
What was she doing on the wait list at all?	7	11
My father's entire family went to that school.	7	11
They know who are you, Peter.	7	11
And they know who I am.	7	11
And they know that we're divorced.	7	11
Greenwich, Connecticut, is built on divorced money.	7	11
Don't yell at me.	7	11
I've arranged for a meeting with the headmaster	7	11
and I'd like for you to accompany me to show	7	11
that we're in this together, if nothing else.	7	11
Yes, of course.	7	11
Tomorrow.	7	11
Just once, I'd like some notice.	7	11
I didn't want to involve you at all.	7	11
(laughing)	7	11
You got me this time, Kirby.	7	11
You're all fired.	7	11
Hold on.	7	11
Someone at McCann-Erickson gave notice in writing.	7	11
I was never informed.	7	11
We were never informed.	7	11
Well, it's obviously a mistake.	7	11
Get Jim Hobart... no, Ferg Donnelly on the horn.	7	11
Just a minute.	7	11
Ladies, this is how rumors get started.	7	11
So this stays in this room till things get sorted out.	7	11
Back to work.	7	11
I'll get Ferg.	7	11
(organ playing)	7	11
So now I just want you to play.	7	11
Just pretend we're not here.	7	11
(turns organ off)	7	11
I'm giving you my permission to play	7	11
with all these great toys.	7	11
Do what you would do if we weren't watching.	7	11
Really? That's what you'd do?	7	11
What's wrong with them?	7	11
You said you didn't want actors.	7	11
Well, real kids are shy.	7	11
And you have to talk to them like people.	7	11
They all have their own toy.	7	11
If we want enthusiasm, we should just have one toy.	7	11
Like a battle royale.	7	11
Just throw one in there and the last kid standing gets the gig.	7	11
It would work.	7	11
You hate kids.	7	11
You know what? I want to see how far you can throw that.	7	11
- (kids laughing) - Take it easy.	7	11
Rog, I'm on my way to lunch. What can I do for you?	7	11
It'll just take a second.	7	11
Someone over there accidentally gave notice on our lease	7	11
and I need you to fix it.	7	11
Oh.	7	11
Well, actually...	7	11
Actually what?	7	11
You really need to talk to Jim about it.	7	11
About what? What the hell is going on, Ferg?	7	11
Roger, calm down.	7	11
I think you'll see it's all good news.	7	11
Go ahead.	7	11
Well, we're gonna move your whole office	7	11
into our building at the end of the month.	7	11
Why?	7	11
We don't mind paying people,	7	11
but it seems ridiculous to rent two floors	7	11
of the Time Life Building when we have plenty of space over here.	7	11
Hold on, are we losing the office	7	11
or the agency?	7	11
That's the wrong way to look at it.	7	11
We're bringing you home.	7	11
This is my home.	7	11
Are you dissolving us?	7	11
I'm gonna set a meeting with Jim for tomorrow.	7	11
Look, this was supposed to be the last thing done, not the first.	7	11
Were you planning this all along?	7	11
Would you stop it? It's going to be great.	7	11
Roger.	7	11
What do I do?	7	11
(typewriter clacking)	7	11
Can I help you?	7	11
Really pulled one over on us.	7	11
Who?	7	11
What are you doing here?	7	11
Roger, you can't just tell Don.	7	11
- Tell Don what? - Do you need ice?	7	11
We're not to be disturbed.	7	11
- Go ahead. - No.	7	11
McCann's moving us to their building.	7	11
We lost our lease.	7	11
Everything must go.	7	11
So we're moving?	7	11
I'd love a new view.	7	11
No, Pete, I don't think that's all there is to it.	7	11
We're being swallowed up.	7	11
We have 30 days.	7	11
SC&P has conflicts. That's why we exist.	7	11
Don't you understand? We don't exist.	7	11
Our rent is too high.	7	11
- Anybody else? - Yes, please.	7	11
That's it? Have a drink?	7	11
Well, I'm not going.	7	11
You want to give up the rest of your money?	7	11
We all have four-year contracts and a noncompete.	7	11
I did not agree to this.	7	11
Yes, you did.	7	11
The minute we sold them the company, we all agreed to it.	7	11
After all that, Jim Cutler wins.	7	11
All that cash and no McCann.	7	11
I hate that guy.	7	11
I like it over there.	7	11
Because you're a sheep.	7	11
Knock it off.	7	11
We've got a meeting with Jim Hobart tomorrow	7	11
to discuss the details. Let's try and be dignified.	7	11
Keep it in this room until we have orders.	7	11
That explains the forecast they wanted.	7	11
I'm sorry.	7	11
They waited so long, I thought we were safe.	7	11
Betsy Wheeler.	7	11
Okay, Betsy, I'm glad that's you.	7	11
Peggy, may I speak with you?	7	11
- Maybe later. - It's very important.	7	11
I'll be right back.	7	11
- (sighs) - What's wrong?	7	11
I'm telling you this because...	7	11
I don't know, because no one else will.	7	11
And you really need to know.	7	11
We're being absorbed by McCann.	7	11
(sighs)	7	11
Are they letting me go?	7	11
No, they'll need you for a while.	7	11
Maybe forever.	7	11
All I know is having a leg up on the rats	7	11
who fly off this ship is going to help you.	7	11
I would want it.	7	11
Oh.	7	11
Are you going?	7	11
I have to.	7	11
I've never worked anywhere else.	7	11
You'll do great.	7	11
You should get back to work.	7	11
For your ears only.	7	11
Hello. It's me.	7	11
I love a call from you in the middle of the day.	7	11
I just wanted to hear your voice.	7	11
Even better. What do you want me to say?	7	11
I got some bad news at work. (sniffles)	7	11
Hey.	7	11
I don't care how bad it is. It's not that bad.	7	11
You don't know that.	7	11
We can talk about it tomorrow when I'm there.	7	11
I didn't know you were coming.	7	11
Lisa, get me on the redeye to New York.	7	11
Now you know.	7	11
(knocks on door)	7	11
Melanie called. She has two two bedrooms to show you tonight.	7	11
And it's five minutes till the Mohawk status meeting.	7	11
Cancel everything.	7	11
What's wrong?	7	11
It's personal, honey.	7	11
(phone ringing)	7	11
Don Draper's office.	7	11
I'll see if he's available.	7	11
It's Lou Avery calling from California.	7	11
(sighs) Shit.	7	11
I better take it.	7	11
Do you mind?	7	11
- Hello, Lou. - Don.	7	11
I think we need to have a conversation.	7	11
Look, we just found out.	7	11
I told Dee not to say anything, but good you know.	7	11
I'm moving next week.	7	11
When did they tell you?	7	11
A couple weeks ago.	7	11
I thought about it for 10 seconds, then I thought,	7	11
"""So what if it's Tokyo? It's my lifelong dream."""	7	11
They have an office in Tokyo?	7	11
They only have an office in Tokyo.	7	11
What are you talking about?	7	11
Tatsunoko Productions.	7	11
"They're making ""Scout's Honor"" into a cartoon."	7	11
What did you think I was talking about?	7	11
It doesn't matter.	7	11
"They made ""Speed Racer,"" Don."	7	11
I got a $15,000 advance.	7	11
Obviously, my mind's made up.	7	11
Obviously.	7	11
I wish I could see the look on your face.	7	11
I bet you're not laughing anymore, are you?	7	11
No, Lou, I'm not.	7	11
Well, sayonara, my friend.	7	11
Enjoy the rest of your miserable life.	7	11
(laughs)	7	11
(sighs)	7	11
(exhales sharply)	7	11
Meredith.	7	11
If we're trying to keep the office calm,	7	11
closing those curtains is a bad idea.	7	11
So spill it. Have you heard something?	7	11
Yes, I did. Lou's moving to Tokyo.	7	11
I'm not even going to tell you why	7	11
because it would give him pleasure.	7	11
The point is Sterling Cooper West is empty.	7	11
Of course it's empty. It's the first drop out of the teapot.	7	11
What I'm saying is it's available.	7	11
We can run a business out of there.	7	11
We have no business.	7	11
I was looking at McCann's rosters	7	11
and there's going to be a lot of clients	7	11
they can't hold on to... Conflicts.	7	11
Take Sunkist for example.	7	11
It's 10 million in billings and growing.	7	11
Coca-Cola owns Minute Maid, so Sunkist is gone.	7	11
Burger Chef, it's four million	7	11
and they just dumped McCann for us.	7	11
They keep telling me their future's in California.	7	11
Exactly. What's our square footage out there?	7	11
1,485.	7	11
An old girlfriend measured it.	7	11
What I'm saying is there's business in California.	7	11
If we can work out of a bassinet,	7	11
we can make McCann money that they'd have to throw away.	7	11
"""We""? I don't want to go back to California."	7	11
That's good. You don't have to. Stay here, they'd like that.	7	11
Anyone else want to stay here?	7	11
Are we really playing this game?	7	11
Dow Chemical.	7	11
McCann fired Ken. And I mean fired him out of a cannon.	7	11
He ain't going near that place.	7	11
- How much is that? - Seven.	7	11
But Ken doesn't like us either.	7	11
But he loves feeling the tip of your nose in the seat of his pants.	7	11
I'll take care of Ken.	7	11
What about Avon?	7	11
I'm sorry, but it's not a conflict.	7	11
But I have the relationship.	7	11
No, that would be stealing a client.	7	11
Avon has to go to McCann and you have to help them keep it.	7	11
We're going to hand deliver all of the clients they want.	7	11
We're meeting with Jim Hobart tomorrow and we can't cancel.	7	11
You think we can secure three accounts in 24 hours?	7	11
We've done it before.	7	11
(door shuts)	7	11
I'm sorry it's so hot in here.	7	11
I'm sorry about the intrusion,	7	11
but this is the only place where we know we won't be seen.	7	11
Well, I'm comfortable here.	7	11
The question is, how does it look out there?	7	11
Considering most firms are Ivy League only	7	11
and you don't even have a degree,	7	11
the landscape looks very promising.	7	11
Who wants me?	7	11
Well, I can list a bunch of initials	7	11
or I could tell you what I really think.	7	11
You're the expert.	7	11
What's the best offer?	7	11
McCann-Erickson.	7	11
I don't want to go there. That's why I called you.	7	11
I understand that.	7	11
Look, I'm foregoing a commission here	7	11
because I'm a career builder.	7	11
I want to help you find a job over and over again.	7	11
And sooner or later,	7	11
you're going to have to go through a place like McCann.	7	11
Big company. Big products.	7	11
National influence.	7	11
You shouldn't stay longer than three years,	7	11
but that's where you should go.	7	11
But what else is out there?	7	11
Plenty.	7	11
For a lot less money with a lot less cachet.	7	11
But you go to McCann and by 1973,	7	11
you'll be looking at four times the salary.	7	11
So that's it?	7	11
You could've just called me and told me this.	7	11
I want you to consider it seriously	7	11
before we take meetings.	7	11
Because word always gets out and McCann is vindictive.	7	11
You're really selling it.	7	11
It's a huge opportunity.	7	11
(people shouting)	7	11
Come in. Glad you could make it.	7	11
- I feel like a spy. - You look like one.	7	11
We have caviar.	7	11
Your favorite red. Chateau Margaux '53.	7	11
I'll have a snort.	7	11
Look, ahem,	7	11
they're dissolving the agency.	7	11
All the business is moving to McCann.	7	11
They finally got you.	7	11
They ate you up.	7	11
We know it was hard enough to convince you to stay when McCann bought us.	7	11
I can't imagine how you feel about things now.	7	11
Yeah, I'm not going.	7	11
So we are proposing	7	11
that we retain our independence in our California office	7	11
with a few select clients who've insisted on it.	7	11
Who else is going?	7	11
Burger Chef and Sunkist so far.	7	11
It's strictly for conflicts.	7	11
And, well, conflicts.	7	11
Tell your superiors nothing is going to change.	7	11
I know I always come at you guns blazing,	7	11
but to them, I'm still the new guy and Ed's son-in-law.	7	11
I can't suggest a move this bold.	7	11
Boldness is always rewarded, am I right, Pete?	7	11
I don't want to make Ken do anything he doesn't want to do.	7	11
Now he obviously thinks it's less bold to change agencies.	7	11
You're wrong. Dow would be thrilled	7	11
to finally have all their accounts at McManus, John & Adams.	7	11
Kenny, you know that we know this account	7	11
inside and out and we have Don Draper.	7	11
That's why you stayed anyway.	7	11
That's true.	7	11
We've done this before.	7	11
You know we can.	7	11
You know, I've fantasized that one day	7	11
I'd be in this situation with you, Roger.	7	11
And, Pete, well,	7	11
you're not exactly an innocent bystander.	7	11
I've toyed with you long enough.	7	11
No.	7	11
Sorry about that.	7	11
(sighs)	7	11
How do I describe California in a way that doesn't make them jealous?	7	11
Tell them my ex-wife lives there.	7	11
(chuckles) Mine, too, so what?	7	11
I know you're attached to California.	7	11
I don't know what it means to you, but it doesn't mean anything to me.	7	11
It does mean something to me.	7	11
I always feel bad about taking your spot	7	11
when I saw what happened to you.	7	11
It should have been you out there, not me.	7	11
You were very persuasive.	7	11
I was misguided.	7	11
I met someone.	7	11
She's not too young and she's gorgeous and a little bit deep.	7	11
Where'd you find a girl like that?	7	11
I knew her in college.	7	11
She's divorced, too, but no kids.	7	11
I bumped into her on Third Avenue	7	11
and we couldn't remember why it didn't work out.	7	11
Oh.	7	11
Congratulations.	7	11
I hope you understand, she can't leave New York and I can't leave her.	7	11
Stop it. You're helping us by staying here.	7	11
Roger called. Dow's a no.	7	11
Let me talk to Ken.	7	11
I suggested that and Roger said it's quite final.	7	11
(sighs) Well, let's comb through the small accounts.	7	11
See if we can cobble a couple million together.	7	11
I'll go get the files.	7	11
Do you want more coffee?	7	11
I want to get on with this. I have someplace to be, Trudy.	7	11
- Good morning. - Peter Campbell.	7	11
Sorry to keep you waiting.	7	11
Well, I assume you know why we're here, Mr. MacDonald.	7	11
We feel there's been a mistake regarding our daughter Tammy.	7	11
It's a Campbell family tradition	7	11
to receive the inimitable education of Greenwich Country Day.	7	11
But you didn't go here.	7	11
No, but a Campbell has been in attendance since it was a barn.	7	11
(both chuckle)	7	11
I'm sorry, but our decision is final.	7	11
Now, Trudy explained to me that you said it's a question of space.	7	11
And I say Tammy would make it worth your while.	7	11
She wouldn't feel extra at all.	7	11
It's not a question of space.	7	11
Your little girl scored very low on her draw-a-man test.	7	11
Well, that's news to us.	7	11
And I find it hard to believe.	7	11
Your ex-wife and I discussed this.	7	11
Children have to draw a man	7	11
and their development is assessed based on the volume of details.	7	11
Eyes, nose, ears, 10 fingers, 10 toes, et cetera.	7	11
Your daughter had only a head, mustache, and necktie.	7	11
- Mustache? - She didn't understand what you wanted.	7	11
And I've been told anything beyond a stick figure	7	11
is considered advanced for her age.	7	11
Albert Einstein didn't speak until he was four years old.	7	11
This is not about your little girl.	7	11
The real problem is that your former wife	7	11
failed to submit applications to other schools.	7	11
That was careless and arrogant.	7	11
- What? - How dare you?	7	11
I think we've said all there is to say.	7	11
We're not leaving until you apologize to Trudy.	7	11
Peter, it doesn't matter.	7	11
Einstein.	7	11
Would you like to step outside?	7	11
Are you sure you wouldn't rather get me while I'm sleeping?	7	11
Like a real Campbell?	7	11
Are you kidding me?	7	11
No MacDonald will ever mix with a Campbell.	7	11
- (scoffs) - What are you talking about?	7	11
It's some stupid story. It's 300 years old.	7	11
He's obviously nuts.	7	11
You should know that his clan took advantage of the gift of hospitality	7	11
and murdered my ancestors while they slept.	7	11
The king ordered it.	7	11
Just be grateful you can remarry and get rid of that name.	7	11
Oh.	7	11
Come on, Trudy.	7	11
Another sucker punch from the Campbell's.	7	11
Coward.	7	11
I'm sorry, sweetheart, the auditions are finished.	7	11
I already auditioned. I'm waiting for my mother.	7	11
Where is she?	7	11
She had to pick up my brother.	7	11
He has another audition.	7	11
Look, Phil, it's a very simple transaction.	7	11
We've been doing it for years.	7	11
Shirley, will you watch her?	7	11
I have every right to be upset	7	11
because I'm an important buyer and you're acting like an asshole.	7	11
Maybe we should go downstairs.	7	11
I'll see if Marsha's back from lunch.	7	11
Do you know your phone number?	7	11
Did I get the part?	7	11
We haven't decided.	7	11
Verna?	7	11
Her purse is gone. They must be at the park. You should ice that hand.	7	11
No, this was a bad idea. I really should get going.	7	11
It was a wonderful idea. Tammy would love to see you by surprise.	7	11
Why did you only apply to one school?	7	11
I had a back up,	7	11
but...	7	11
I shouldn't tell you this.	7	11
You can tell me.	7	11
Well, the head of admissions was a little fresh with me.	7	11
What school?	7	11
Peter, you can't punch everyone.	7	11
Maybe I should've never left the city.	7	11
The city's become a toilet.	7	11
Well, it's difficult out here.	7	11
I don't have a lot of friends.	7	11
I don't believe that.	7	11
It's the husbands.	7	11
I don't want to hear this.	7	11
Every time I want to do something...	7	11
Go into town, any social event...	7	11
They won't leave me alone.	7	11
"Then I think, ""Who am I kidding?"""	7	11
"In 10 years, everyone will leave me alone."""	7	11
That is not true.	7	11
You're ageless.	7	11
I'm feeling sorry for myself.	7	11
This has been an ordeal.	7	11
I'll solve the school problem in 30 days.	7	11
All it requires is a check.	7	11
- Tell Tammy I love her. - You never take no for an answer.	7	11
- Actually, can I use your phone? - Yes, of course.	7	11
- Where's Pete? - He may be meeting us there.	7	11
Good, I made it.	7	11
- You need anything? - Not now.	7	11
I just talked Secor Laxatives into joining us.	7	11
- Go ahead. - Where they difficult to move?	7	11
All I had to do was not make that joke.	7	11
- Shall we? - (elevator bell dings)	7	11
(laughs)	7	11
Hello, Susie's office. How many I help you?	7	11
(sighs) Okay.	7	11
We got three boys, three girls.	7	11
- Top picks. - She has a lisp.	7	11
Lisps are cute.	7	11
We could pluck that eyebrow.	7	11
You know what? I don't care. You decide.	7	11
I know you don't mean that.	7	11
Okay.	7	11
You can't tell anyone.	7	11
- You can't even tell Elaine. - That won't be a problem.	7	11
- Why? - What is it?	7	11
McCann's taking over the agency.	7	11
We're moving over there.	7	11
- Jesus, to McCann? - Shh.	7	11
- (stapler clicks) - (screams)	7	11
- What happened? - I stapled my thumb.	7	11
Oh, it's okay.	7	11
I know it hurts. It happens all the time.	7	11
Oh, great. Go get some ice.	7	11
- You get ice, I'll pull out the staple. - No.	7	11
Oh, here she is.	7	11
It was an accident.	7	11
- What is going on? - I'll get the first aid kit.	7	11
- She stapled her finger. - Susie Q, let mommy see.	7	11
- Very sorry. - We're going to the emergency room.	7	11
It's not that bad.	7	11
You shouldn't let a child play with dangerous things.	7	11
You shouldn't have abandoned her in a midtown office building.	7	11
It's nobody's fault.	7	11
I had to go pick up my son	7	11
because your audition ran two hours late.	7	11
So you just left an eight year old at a job interview?	7	11
This is her favorite thing. She loves it.	7	11
- And I bet you love cashing her checks. - Peggy.	7	11
You do what you want with your children,	7	11
I do what I want with mine.	7	11
How the hell did that turn into that?	7	11
(inaudible) her.	7	11
I know you got other things on your mind, but...	7	11
Let's just get back to work.	7	11
(sighs) Sure.	7	11
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,	7	11
but you're 20 minutes early.	7	11
We just wanted to get everything ready.	7	11
For what?	7	11
Gentlemen, would you please have a seat?	7	11
You see that? We could use some manners around here.	7	11
I don't know about that,	7	11
but we are here to discuss everything we can add to McCann-Erickson.	7	11
- So are we. - Go on.	7	11
Our agencies compliment each other in so many ways.	7	11
But as we considered this union,	7	11
we were alarmed at how much business	7	11
we would all be giving up due to conflicts.	7	11
There will be casualties.	7	11
Sunkist Orange Juice, Burger Chef, Secor Laxatives,	7	11
and Tinker Bell Cookies cannot come along.	7	11
$18 million in billings.	7	11
But what if we could service those clients	7	11
from the modest offices of SC&P West?	7	11
The best part is we'd still be available to you	7	11
in any capacity you wish.	7	11
California.	7	11
It's a gold rush out there.	7	11
In fact, we've made several...	7	11
Don. Don.	7	11
Don, stop. This isn't necessary.	7	11
Jim, would you let him finish?	7	11
- Can you give us a minute? - Yes, absolutely.	7	11
- Do you want this? - No.	7	11
This is $275,000 in profit.	7	11
All cost covered that you don't have to lift a finger to earn.	7	11
Don, sit down. Please.	7	11
I'm sick about the way this was handled.	7	11
It made the whole thing look very capricious.	7	11
I assure you, it wasn't.	7	11
And you have to believe me when I say we're rolling out the red carpet.	7	11
We're very excited about this.	7	11
- You can understand our attachment to our clients. - And our name.	7	11
I don't think you understand what's happened.	7	11
It's done.	7	11
You passed the test.	7	11
You are getting five of the most coveted jobs in advertising.	7	11
And all the resources that go with it.	7	11
Travel, adventure.	7	11
An international presence.	7	11
I shouldn't have to sell you on this.	7	11
You are dying and going to advertising heaven.	7	11
Buick.	7	11
Ortho Pharmaceutical.	7	11
Nabisco.	7	11
(whispers) Coca-Cola.	7	11
Stop struggling.	7	11
You won.	7	11
Take the rest of the day off.	7	11
Pop some champagne.	7	11
"""I Followed My Heart"" playing"	7	11
I feel like I should make a toast.	7	11
Again?	7	11
Well, we didn't drink to Cooper.	7	11
Glad he missed it.	7	11
Well, I have to go.	7	11
Kevin can wait. We should get dinner.	7	11
I have plans.	7	11
Come back after.	7	11
Actually, I'll drop you off. I should call Trudy.	7	11
She had quite a day as well.	7	11
We went down swinging.	7	11
Don't be a baby. I'll see you tomorrow.	7	11
I'm going to get another round.	7	11
This is my last one.	7	11
I have a date.	7	11
You never worked at a place this size, have you?	7	11
It's got a lot of advantages.	7	11
You never saw the old Sterling Cooper.	7	11
- It was mammoth. - Not like this.	7	11
You're happy about it.	7	11
That's okay, I understand.	7	11
I'm relieved.	7	11
I'm ready to let someone else drive for a while.	7	11
I'd like to make a toast to Lou Avery.	7	11
The Japs are going to eat him alive.	7	11
(both chuckle)	7	11
What a disaster.	7	11
Come on, Joan.	7	11
I need you to be the voice of the bright side.	7	11
Hobart listed off accounts for everyone but me.	7	11
Put you on Ortho Pharmaceutical.	7	11
No.	7	11
And I wouldn't count on anything he said.	7	11
I don't know.	7	11
For the first time, I feel like whatever happens is supposed to happen.	7	11
That's nice.	7	11
That's what you should've said.	7	11
Well, we both know	7	11
they're never going to take me seriously over there.	7	11
They don't know who they're dealing with.	7	11
I can't do any work.	7	11
(sighs)	7	11
Look, I've hunted for a job before,	7	11
and I may not have to, but I appreciate the warning.	7	11
No, I keep thinking about that woman.	7	11
Her kid got hurt. She felt guilty.	7	11
I know what she felt.	7	11
I understand the entire psychological situation.	7	11
She shouldn't have talked to me that way.	7	11
She shouldn't have kids.	7	11
That's not for you to say.	7	11
Ah, Jesus, I can't even agree with you.	7	11
I don't hate kids.	7	11
Look, you got to a certain point in your life	7	11
and it didn't happen.	7	11
I understand you're angry about it,	7	11
but you've got a lot of other things.	7	11
- Don't do that. - I mean it.	7	11
You couldn't have done all you've done otherwise.	7	11
I guess that's the secret to your spectacular career?	7	11
The fact that you don't have kids?	7	11
Not that I know of.	7	11
That's funny to you.	7	11
Because it wouldn't matter if you did. You can walk away.	7	11
I would never do that.	7	11
But you may not even know. That's what you said.	7	11
"""Stranger on the Shore"" playing."	7	11
It's been a long day.	7	11
You're right.	7	11
I didn't mean to judge her.	7	11
But you did and you don't understand it at all.	7	11
I had a mother. And she wasn't great.	7	11
And I don't know that she wanted me, so I understand something.	7	11
But you don't understand your mother.	7	11
Well, maybe I don't want to.	7	11
Maybe she was very young.	7	11
And followed her heart and got in trouble.	7	11
And no one should have to make a mistake	7	11
just like a man does and not be able to move on.	7	11
She should be able to live the rest of her life just like a man does.	7	11
You're right.	7	11
I know.	7	11
Maybe you do what you thought was the best thing.	7	11
(sighs)	7	11
What did you do?	7	11
I'm...	7	11
I'm here.	7	11
And...	7	11
Oh.	7	11
He's with a family somewhere.	7	11
I don't know,	7	11
but it's not because I don't care.	7	11
I don't know because you're not supposed to know.	7	11
Or you can't go on with your life.	7	11
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.	7	11
Well, ahem,	7	11
you don't know lots of things about lots of people.	7	11
That's the point.	7	11
No, it's not.	7	11
I'm fine.	7	11
I have work to do.	7	11
You know, I made a deal with God that if this worked out,	7	11
I would give up smoking.	7	11
Message received.	7	11
You're a young man with an incredible future ahead of you.	7	11
"(""I Love So Much About You"" playing.)"	7	11
No more Sterling Cooper	7	11
and no more Sterlings.	7	11
Margaret is the only daughter of an only son of an only son.	7	11
All that's left is a mausoleum at Greenwood.	7	11
What's in a name?	7	11
Every copywriter thinks they're Shakespeare.	7	11
It's something to aspire to.	7	11
I always envied that.	7	11
The way you're always reaching.	7	11
I always envied you didn't have to.	7	11
In another lifetime, I'd have been your chauffeur.	7	11
Then you would've been screwing my grandmother.	7	11
- Do you have somewhere to be? - I'm afraid so.	7	11
Tell her to join us.	7	11
She wouldn't like it.	7	11
You wouldn't like it.	7	11
Now I've got to meet her.	7	11
You have.	7	11
It's Marie.	7	11
Marie Calvet.	7	11
You're serious?	7	11
Guess I should've asked your permission.	7	11
Just warn me before you tell Megan.	7	11
- I want to leave the country. - She knows.	7	11
Then why didn't you tell me?	7	11
I wanted to make sure it wasn't going away.	7	11
She's crazy, you know?	7	11
When I married my secretary,	7	11
you were hard on me.	7	11
And then you went and did the same thing.	7	11
You know what?	7	11
For the second time today, I surrender.	7	11
- I'm happy for you. - Thank you.	7	11
You are okay.	7	11
(siren wailing)	7	11
(knocks)	7	11
(TV playing)	7	11
Can I help you?	7	11
I'm sorry. I must have the wrong apartment.	7	11
Kenneth, do you know this guy?	7	11
I've never seen him before. I swear.	7	11
No, I was looking for Diana Baur. She used to live here.	7	11
Oh. Well, we just moved in.	7	11
Do you know how to reach her?	7	11
She left her furniture. The manager told us to sell it.	7	11
Sorry to bother you.	7	11
You want another drink?	7	11
Good morning.	7	11
What did Caroline say?	7	11
They're making lists.	7	11
Somebody's not going.	7	11
The last thing they need is another office manager.	7	11
Or another black girl.	7	11
I'm Roger Sterling's second secretary.	7	11
Caroline's going to elbow me out the window.	7	11
What are you talking about?	7	11
My goodness, Meredith.	7	11
We should put a bell on you.	7	11
Good morning.	7	11
What is going on?	7	11
There are rumors flying like bats around here.	7	11
What have you heard?	7	11
Nothing from you.	7	11
Are we going to McCann and am I going with you?	7	11
Meredith, sweetheart...	7	11
"Don't ""sweetheart"" me."	7	11
In a month, you're not going to have an office	7	11
and you're not going to have an apartment.	7	11
Do you want to lose me, too?	7	11
I was going to tell you today.	7	11
You are coming with me if you want to go.	7	11
Now, can I get some Alka-Seltzer?	7	11
No. It is not a normal day.	7	11
Everyone's living in a fright.	7	11
You're right.	7	11
Get Mr. Sterling on the line.	7	11
(phone ringing)	7	11
Marsha.	7	11
- This is Peggy. - It's me.	7	11
Where are you?	7	11
Locked in my office.	7	11
Bourbon with my breakfast.	7	11
Did you figure out what you're going to do?	7	11
I'm going to McCann.	7	11
Really?	7	11
And you can too if you want.	7	11
You think I should?	7	11
Everything's going to be fine.	7	11
(sighs)	7	11
I'm so dumb, I believe you.	7	11
Stay on the phone, will you?	7	11
Sure.	7	11
(murmuring)	7	11
Can I have your attention, everyone?	7	11
Some of you may have heard already,	7	11
but we're proud to announce that Sterling Cooper & Partners	7	11
will be moving to McCann-Erickson.	7	11
(murmuring)	7	11
Now our president, Roger Sterling,	7	11
would like to say a word.	7	11
We know this news may come as a surprise,	7	11
but McCann has assured us the transition will be as smooth as possible.	7	11
(murmuring louder)	7	11
They've already set aside room for us.	7	11
(murmuring continues)	7	11
This is good news.	7	11
We didn't do this.	7	11
Hold on.	7	11
This is the beginning of something...	7	11
not the end.	7	11

Thank you.	7	12
MEREDITH: Good morning.	7	12
You don't have to do this every day.	7	12
I won't have you lost again.	7	12
I wasn't lost, I was late. I was fibbing.	7	12
Well, you can't do that. It throws off a very busy schedule.	7	12
And not to mention everything, et cetera.	7	12
 Can you call housekeeping and ask them not to make up my bed while I'm still in it?	7	12
Well, you won't have to endure the hardships	7	12
of the Plaza much longer.	7	12
The floors of your apartment will be done Monday.	7	12
If you pick paint, you could move in next week.	7	12
That's great.	7	12

When I was packing,	7	12
well, I think these were best kept from the movers.	7	12
Have you thought about new furniture?	7	12
I think it looks great in here.	7	12
 No, for your apartment. You only have a bed.	7	12
I made dinner reservations in Farmington tomorrow.	7	12
You're taking Sally back to school.	7	12

You and the computer are gonna share an office over there?	7	12
No, the old girl served her purpose.	7	12
McCann is mission control.	7	12
Statisticians, programmers,	7	12
5 men and 10 women just handling data.	7	12
Maybe they can keep track of your hat size. Seems to be growing.	7	12
Why are you still here?	7	12
Somebody's got to hand over the keys.	7	12
Well, I'm on 24 and you're on 26,	7	12
but I'll be up there all the time.	7	12
There's an executive dining room.	7	12
You know, I once rode on a bus to camp sitting next to a guy like you.	7	12
We're not gonna be bunkmates, Crane.	7	12
I'll make them build another floor if I have to.	7	12
I'm not going to let you spoil the moment. My moment.	7	12
See you in the funny papers.	7	12
I don't know what's keeping the building representatives,	7	12
but I feel perfectly comfortable...	7	12
Forging my signature?	7	12
No, that's okay. You can go.	7	12
Well, this is my last day and I wanted to thank you.	7	12
Bullshit. They can't fire you.	7	12
Actually, I took another job.	7	12
Travelers Insurance. My cousin works there.	7	12
Look, I hate Caroline, too.	7	12
No, it's...	7	12
- Did I do something? - No.	7	12
It's just I kept thinking about walking into a new office.	7	12
Yeah. I'm doing it, too.	7	12
And now there's gonna be one less person I know.	7	12
Mr. Sterling, it's not you.	7	12
Advertising is not a very comfortable place for everyone.	7	12
Oh.	7	12
That in mind, I have to say thank you.	7	12
You're very amusing.	7	12
- Fat lot of good it did me. - (CHUCKLES)	7	12
Hello, neighbor.	7	12
We're the welcome wagon. We heard you had a window.	7	12
Aren't you sweet to come by? This is Beverly.	7	12
- And who are you? - I'm Libby Blum.	7	12
Karen Schmidt.	7	12
Can we have a minute?	7	12
We're copywriters.	7	12
I recognized the names. I was just going over Tampax.	7	12
We also did the pill for Ortho...	7	12
If it's in it, near it or makes you think about it, we're on it.	7	12
(CHUCKLES)	7	12
So, Topaz Pantyhose and Butler Shoes set off an alarm.	7	12
But we really love Avon.	7	12
This is incredible.	7	12
So you just came in here to get on my business.	7	12
And to say hello.	7	12
Well, I'm flattered by both.	7	12
If you want us, just ask Frank in the studio.	7	12
He'll ask Bobby in traffic,	7	12
and he'll tell Carl, the associate creative director.	7	12
You can put a request in however you want.	7	12
We'll let the Soviets deal with it.	7	12
You're aware that Peggy Olson handles all of those accounts?	7	12
See, I told you.	7	12
Well, we'd love to share the crumbs with her.	7	12
Thank you so much for the plant.	7	12
Oh, we're going to the Oyster Bar tonight.	7	12
We have an informal ladies' club.	7	12
It's not women's lib, just a bitch session.	7	12
We are strictly consciousness lowering.	7	12
(CHUCKLES) When I get settled in.	7	12
(PEGGY SIGHS)	7	12
Incredible.	7	12
Did you come to get your furniture?	7	12
There was a mix-up. My office isn't ready.	7	12
Why are you still here?	7	12
Well, I'm not going to McCann. And so far I'm not going anywhere.	7	12
And I'm being paid through the end of the week,	7	12
so I thought I'd make some long-distance phone calls.	7	12
Oh.	7	12
We lost Dow.	7	12
We still owe them work.	7	12
Could you get Mr. Kreutzer at Sugarberry Ham for me?	7	12
Why would I do that?	7	12
Because Marsha's sorting things out over there	7	12
and I'm not calling myself.	7	12
I'm giving you a standing ovation.	7	12

And we just bought an entire agency in Milwaukee to get Miller Beer.	7	12
For me?	7	12
When I want something, I get it.	7	12
And I've been trying to get you for 10 years.	7	12
You're my white whale, Don.	7	12
Well, maybe you should send me to the Bahamas.	7	12
In due time.	7	12
The important thing is we're expecting you	7	12
to bring things up a notch around here.	7	12
Jim, I don't know what to tell ya. I'll do my best.	7	12

Well, we already are on TV.	7	12
We know that. What Dennis is saying is...	7	12
You know, I'm in Atlanta all the time.	7	12
How about a trip to Augusta, play a few holes?	7	12
You any good?	7	12
No.	7	12
No, I'm not.	7	12
Listen, my girl is telling me that it's time for our staff meeting.	7	12
- Thanks again for the call. - Of course.	7	12
Such a pleasure, Barry.	7	12
Bye.	7	12
Who's next?	7	12
I don't know what to say except Barry is in a wheelchair.	7	12
What?	7	12
I told you that...	7	12
and I wrote it down.	7	12
Oh, I thought that was Charlie Butler...	7	12
from the shoes.	7	12
No, it's not.	7	12
And it's Charles Butler and it's footwear.	7	12
(SIGHS) I can't believe you.	7	12
It's an honest mistake.	7	12
"You heard him say he was ""walking around the office."""	7	12
It's an expression.	7	12
Which he shouldn't be able to use.	7	12
I stayed up all night preparing those briefs.	7	12
Mr. Donnelly said you'd be on the call to help with the transition,	7	12
but you seem like you don't even care about keeping these accounts.	7	12
I'm sorry. Who told you you got to get pissed off?	7	12
All I ask is that you please read the brief	7	12
before our next call.	7	12

They thought I was a secretary?	7	12
Did you tell Don what happened?	7	12
- Do you want me to? - No.	7	12
- Maybe I should call Joan. - That's not her job there.	7	12
- I know that, Marsha. - I am taking care of it.	7	12
As well as your mail and memos	7	12
regarding Peter Pan Peanut Butter and Tampax.	7	12
What happened to all my things?	7	12
They're putting your boxes in storage.	7	12
You will have an office any minute.	7	12
In the meantime, you can work in the pool.	7	12
I am a copy supervisor.	7	12
I am not setting foot in there until I have an office.	7	12
If they want me, they can reach me here.	7	12
At home?	7	12
No. No. I'll be at SC&P.	7	12
Hell, that's where my furniture is.	7	12
I will let them know.	7	12
JOAN: Could you hold that?	7	12
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)	7	12
Good morning.	7	12
How are you, stranger?	7	12
Homesick.	7	12
- Well, takes some time to settle in. - I know.	7	12
- You should come by for a drink. - (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)	7	12
When am I going to do that?	7	12
Put me on your calendar.	7	12
We don't share any accounts. You're too important.	7	12
Not for you.	7	12
Believe me, I'd involve you if I could.	7	12
It's been a little bumpy.	7	12
I can still interfere.	7	12
No, I'll figure it out.	7	12
Of that I am certain.	7	12
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)	7	12
- Let's make a date for lunch. - Soon.	7	12
MEREDITH: Tell me if you like the general idea so I can take a few risks.	7	12
Where'd you learn to do this?	7	12
I'm an army brat, remember? New base every year.	7	12
I want to live here.	7	12
You're my decorator. I'll pay you in cash.	7	12
Nonsense. I love it.	7	12
Lunch in the executive boardroom with Miller Beer.	7	12
They asked if roast beef was okay.	7	12
Perfect.	7	12
(DOOR CLOSES)	7	12
Joan, nice to see you up here.	7	12
Are you coming to the Sears briefing? That's a good idea.	7	12
No, I was actually looking for Mr. Donnelly,	7	12
but if now is a bad time...	7	12
Ferg.	7	12
Pete, it's your meeting. You can start without me.	7	12
I'm gonna put in a request to get you involved with this.	7	12
Thank you.	7	12
That's thoughtful.	7	12
So, what can I do for you?	7	12
It's just...	7	12
Regarding the Avon transition,	7	12
I thought maybe Pete could be an asset.	7	12
Pete's a vice president. What's wrong with Dennis?	7	12
I like Dennis personally.	7	12
I'm not sure the client responded to him.	7	12
Say no more. I'll take care of it.	7	12
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)	7	12
Hello?	7	12
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)	7	12
Are those my boxes?	7	12
L gotta go.	7	12
L gotta gQ!	7	12
Yeah, I signed for them,	7	12
but I was wondering what happened.	7	12
Ugh. You've got to be kidding me.	7	12
You know we're the only ones here.	7	12
Have you been on the phone all morning?	7	12
Stan called. He doesn't have a phone yet.	7	12
He's on the 14th floor. Come by and say hi.	7	12
And	7	12
I prepared this for your approval.	7	12
PEGGY: What is this?	7	12
"ED: Do you think ""quagmire"" should be plural?"	7	12
(SIGHS) We can't do this.	7	12
They're never going to look at it.	7	12
Ed, you could easily end up	7	12
working for Dow again or Ken Cosgrove.	7	12
You could even end up working for me.	7	12
That's not very subtle.	7	12
I asked you to do one damn thing and you didn't even do it.	7	12
Fine. I quit.	7	12
(CHUCKLES)	7	12
Well, thanks for everything.	7	12
When you get settled in over there, which will happen,	7	12
give me a call.	7	12
I promise.	7	12
(INDISTINCT TALKING)	7	12
I'm sorry. It's Bob, right?	7	12
Yes. Don, good to see you.	7	12
We've got the best box lunch around.	7	12
It should have your name on it.	7	12
Is this the Miller Beer meeting?	7	12
It certainly is. Bill Phillips, Conley Research.	7	12
Don Draper and Ted Chaough.	7	12
- A pleasure. - Shall we?	7	12
Is this every creative director in the agency?	7	12
It's only half of us.	7	12
"So, are you here to ""bring us up a notch,"" too?"	7	12
(CHUCKLES) So they tell me.	7	12
BOB: Good morning, gentlemen.	7	12
As you know, this is Bill Phillips, senior director at Conley Research.	7	12
Bill, why don't you tell us a little bit about this exciting new beverage.	7	12
Despite that pile of facts and figures in front of you,	7	12
I don't look at this as a presentation of research.	7	12
To me, this is an opportunity to stimulate	7	12
some of our industry's finest imaginations.	7	12
I'm going to describe a man to you of very specific qualities.	7	12
He lives in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio.	7	12
"Some call it ""the Heartland."""	7	12
"Some call it ""the beer belt."""	7	12
He has some college.	7	12
Makes a good living,	7	12
but it doesn't feel like it because he works long hours.	7	12
He has a lawn mower.	7	12
Wants a hammock.	7	12
Bunch of power tools in the garage that he never uses.	7	12
He loves sports because he used to play them.	7	12
And he loves dogs because they don't talk.	7	12
(ALL LAUGHING)	7	12
We all know this man	7	12
because there are millions of him	7	12
and he drinks beer.	7	12
Not just any beer.	7	12
No, it has to be his brand.	7	12
And what is his brand?	7	12
The one he drank in college?	7	12
The one his dad drank?	7	12
The one that comes in the best bottle, can, tap?	7	12
It doesn't matter because that's it,	7	12
and it's not open for discussion.	7	12
Now, you all know that that's not true...	7	12
but how do you get him to open his mind?	7	12
Better have something more,	7	12
or in this case...	7	12
less.	7	12
And that's tricky.	7	12
When we talk about a low-calorie beer...	7	12
we immediately become feminine.	7	12
"- It's the word ""calorie."" - (DOOR CLOSES)"	7	12
It makes you think of a reducing plan.	7	12
A note on the fridge to remind her about her diet.	7	12
(KNOCK ON DOOR)	7	12
Your girl still at lunch?	7	12
Beverly always takes the whole hour. I insist.	7	12
I have a little news for you.	7	12
Oh, I hope I didn't cause any trouble.	7	12
Too early for you?	7	12
No, of course not.	7	12
So, I spoke with Dennis.	7	12
I hope I didn't ruffle any feathers.	7	12
Well, here's how it looks.	7	12
Like some junior account man came in	7	12
and started swinging her elbows.	7	12
He didn't read the brief...	7	12
and I'm not Dennis' junior.	7	12
Joan, see it from his side.	7	12
He has a wife and three children. He's not going to work for a girl.	7	12
What's he gonna say to a client?	7	12
"""She's my boss""?"	7	12
It happens all the time now.	7	12
Peggy Olson was our copy chief.	7	12
It's different with a bunch of writers fresh out of Columbia.	7	12
And honestly, I doubt that's gonna continue here anyway.	7	12
I see.	7	12
Joan, I didn't come down here to upset you.	7	12
I agree that the best way to keep the business	7	12
is to keep your status on your accounts.	7	12
Oh.	7	12
And you'll certainly get the respect you desire	7	12
now it's just you and me.	7	12
You don't have to do that, but I accept.	7	12
(BOTH CHUCKLE)	7	12
Mmm. Good.	7	12
Now, first thing we have to do is pay this guy a visit.	7	12
- Who? - Barry from Avon.	7	12
We owe him an apology.	7	12
And let's face it, it would be good to get out of town,	7	12
even if it's to Atlanta.	7	12
I appreciate that, but I don't want to put you out.	7	12
Look, I know a good job when I see one.	7	12
No, it's just that might be too much.	7	12
He'll be in New York soon	7	12
and Avon corporate is blocks away.	7	12
Hey, I'm easy.	7	12
I'm not expecting anything more than a good time.	7	12
Excuse me?	7	12
I mean, I want to get to know you, of course.	7	12
Of course.	7	12
Good.	7	12
My first act of benevolence, you can call Charles Butler on your own.	7	12
We'll take him to lunch next week.	7	12
Thank you.	7	12
From now on, no one comes between me and your business.	7	12
I appreciate that.	7	12
We can't lose those accounts. What would you do around here?	7	12
(DOORBELL RINGS)	7	12
Loretta!	7	12
Here she is.	7	12
Sally left?	7	12
Yes. She got a ride with her friend.	7	12
And no one thought to call me, I guess.	7	12
- Do you want something to drink? - No.	7	12
They left after lunch.	7	12
I told her to call your office.	7	12
Your secretary is a moron.	7	12
I was out of the office. I wanted to get the car washed.	7	12
She comes and goes as she pleases.	7	12
And we can't get mad at her for being independent.	7	12
It's normal.	7	12
- Is that what Freud says? - (CHUCKLES)	7	12
So far I haven't come across anyone normal.	7	12
You Okay?	7	12
I carried $100 worth of textbooks yesterday	7	12
during registration.	7	12
- Maybe you're getting old. - (LAUGHS)	7	12
I'm younger than you.	7	12
Always have been, always will be.	7	12
Maybe you could find some nice freshman to carry your books.	7	12
That's fine.	7	12
When do the boys get home?	7	12
Gene's at Cub Scouts and Bobby's got baseball.	7	12
They won't be back until 6:30.	7	12
I'll let you get back to your studies.	7	12
I've always wanted to do this.	7	12
Knock 'em dead, Birdie.	7	12
Bye.	7	12
(WINCES)	7	12
Shit.	7	12
(SIGNAL SWITCH CLICKS)	7	12
Your stomach is grumbling.	7	12
(CHUCKLING) You never let me eat.	7	12
I can make fried chicken.	7	12
I don't mind playing the house,	7	12
but as long as your mother and Kevin are away,	7	12
why don't you call in sick?	7	12
Let me take you to Bermuda.	7	12
No.	7	12
Cape Cod?	7	12
I don't wanna go anywhere I don't want to go.	7	12
Don't make plans for me.	7	12
All right. All right.	7	12
I have a lot of work.	7	12
Look, I know I told you not to complain,	7	12
but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about it.	7	12
But you really don't.	7	12
- What happened? - (SIGHS)	7	12
It's a big place, and I asked the wrong person for help.	7	12
And I don't think I can get out of it.	7	12
Well, if you don't like that job, you don't have to do it.	7	12
You got enough, and you got me.	7	12
They still owe me over half a million dollars.	7	12
I'm not walking away from that.	7	12
So, this is a business problem.	7	12
Now, I can help.	7	12
You're already helping.	7	12
There's two ways I deal with disagreeable people.	7	12
One, you can call a lawyer, throw a bunch of paper at them,	7	12
tie them up in court, cost them some money.	7	12
Nobody wins,	7	12
but it loosens the earth.	7	12
What's the second?	7	12
You can call a guy.	7	12
"""A"	7	12
I'm a developer. Men get stubborn.	7	12
"What does ""a guy"" do?"	7	12
You get the right guy, all they have to do is show up.	7	12
You've really done that?	7	12
You seem to like it, so I'm gonna say yes.	7	12
You're disturbed.	7	12
Doesn't seem like such a big problem now, does it?	7	12
(ON RADIO) I don't want to say goodbye for the summer	7	12
MAN ON RADIO: Beautiful night out there tonight.	7	12
In downtown Cleveland, we have a high of 75, low of 62.	7	12
"COOPER"". Not too sticky,"	7	12
and it should stay that way through the weekend.	7	12
I don't know about you,	7	12
but I am not ready to say goodbye to the summer.	7	12
But not true of the folks at Higbee's Department Store	7	12
where they're ready to provide all the back-to-school fashions.	7	12
I'm really tired, aren't I?	7	12
You've been driving for seven hours in the wrong direction.	7	12
Where are you going?	7	12
Racine, Wisconsin. Ever been there?	7	12
No. What's in Racine?	7	12
Maybe some waitress who doesn't care about you?	7	12
You shouldn't do that.	7	12
That's not gonna stop me.	7	12
You like to play the stranger.	7	12
Remember On the Road?	7	12
I've never read that book, you know that.	7	12
I'm riding the rails.	7	12
"""Whither goest thou, America,"	7	12
"""in thy shiny car in the night?"""	7	12
Yes, it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer	7	12
But I'll feel the emptiness	7	12

- Hello? - MARS HA: Peggy?	7	12
Yes. Who is this?	7	12
It's Marsha.	7	12
I thought I would try this before I ran over.	7	12
Your phone's dead.	7	12
What do you want?	7	12
Well, on behalf of McCann Erickson,	7	12
I want to welcome you to your new office.	7	12
When can you come over?	7	12
- Well, I guess right now. - Wonderful.	7	12
Can you work at a drafting table	7	12
till they bring your things over tomorrow?	7	12
Yes. Thank you.	7	12
(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)	7	12
Hello?	7	12
Is someone there?	7	12
(MUSIC CONTINUES)	7	12
- Roger. - Oh, Christ!	7	12
I have a heart condition, you know.	7	12
Believe it or not, I'm not scary. Organ music is scary.	7	12
What are you doing here?	7	12
I told Caroline I wanted to pack my personal things,	7	12
which I will eventually do	7	12
as soon as I figure out why she thought my bar wasn't personal.	7	12
Did you try Don's office?	7	12
All I found was lighter fluid. I'm not there yet.	7	12
Mine's gone.	7	12
I don't want to go to a bar. I did that yesterday.	7	12
Listen, sweetheart, if you don't mind...	7	12
I'm not running an errand. I have to go to McCann.	7	12
Three days ago.	7	12
They screwed up my office, it...	7	12
it doesn't matter. They're finally ready.	7	12
I'd do it for you.	7	12
Would you drink vermouth?	7	12
Yes, I'm afraid I would.	7	12
I'll be along in a minute.	7	12
Oh, Mr. Hobart. Can I help you?	7	12
You're sitting in his chair. You're obviously not expecting him.	7	12
I told Daphne I don't know when he'll be in.	7	12
Can I take a message?	7	12
Sure.	7	12
Tell him he missed Nabisco	7	12
and National Cash Register just left,	7	12
so he might as well take the rest of the day off.	7	12
Thank you. I'll let him know.	7	12
Is he on a bender, sweetheart?	7	12
I haven't heard from him,	7	12
but he went to take his daughter to school.	7	12
I'm not concerned.	7	12
"Look at this. ""Christmas Day, 1951"	7	12

I don't know.	7	12
On! (CHUCKLES)	7	12
Roberta.	7	12
We had our drink.	7	12
You clearly don't need help. You need an audience.	7	12
McCann made you wait. You can make them wait.	7	12
I'm not enjoying this.	7	12
Oh, my God. What is this?	7	12
It's an octopus pleasuring a lady.	7	12
It was Cooper's. Was in his office forever.	7	12
You can have it.	7	12
You can put it in your office.	7	12
No. They won't take me seriously.	7	12
That's pretty serious. It's 150 years old.	7	12
You know I need to make men feel at ease.	7	12
Who told you that?	7	12
So now I gave you something, you can sit tight and keep me company.	7	12
You think you're gonna have fun like this over there?	7	12
This is more attention than I've ever gotten from you.	7	12
You should see the floor I'm on. It's a nursing home.	7	12
What the hell happened?	7	12
You're acting like you had nothing to do with this.	7	12
I'll have you know, I held this place together.	7	12
I know you think that, but you actually sold it.	7	12
You were supposed to watch out for us.	7	12
This business doesn't have feelings.	7	12
You get bought, you get sold, you get fired.	7	12
If the account moves, you move.	7	12
Even if your name's on the damn door,	7	12
you should know better than to get attached to some walls.	7	12
Well, hopefully I'll have that problem someday.	7	12
Okay, hot stuff.	7	12
It's exciting.	7	12
I mean, I know it's going to be challenging...	7	12
but I needed that.	7	12
So do you.	7	12
In the summer of '44,	7	12
it was over 100 degrees every day in the Pacific,	7	12
so we dropped anchor in the Ulithi Lagoon to go for a swim.	7	12
And you can imagine the men. It was bedlam.	7	12
But I couldn't do it.	7	12
Can't you swim?	7	12
Did I mention I was in the Navy?	7	12
No, the real problem was	7	12
it was a two-story drop off our cruiser.	7	12
We all have regrets.	7	12
No, I did it.	7	12
I just needed a push.	7	12
This was a hell of a boat, you know.	7	12
Come on.	7	12
It just looks good now,	7	12
but it was miserable when you were in it.	7	12
Trust me.	7	12
Is that really how you're gonna remember this place?	7	12
No.	7	12
Good.	7	12
This is the one for the road, okay?	7	12
You gonna show up drunk at 4:00 on your first day?	7	12
(CHUCKLES)	7	12
You know any Freemasons?	7	12
(DOORBELL RINGS)	7	12
Yes? Can I help you?	7	12
I'm looking for Mrs. Baur.	7	12
I'm Mrs. Baur.	7	12
Good evening. I hope I'm not disturbing your dinner.	7	12
Not yet. My husband will be home any minute.	7	12
Well, I really just need to talk to you.	7	12
I'm Bill Phillips from Conley Research.	7	12
We represent an array of American companies,	7	12
including Miller Beer,	7	12
and out of over 900 entries, you, Diana Baur,	7	12
were chosen to win a brand-new Westinghouse refrigerator	7	12
full of Miller Beer.	7	12
- Oh. - (CHUCKLES)	7	12
Now, you have your choice, white or harvest gold.	7	12
That's the fridge, not the beer, of course.	7	12
Well, that sounds wonderful...	7	12
but I'm not Diana, I'm Laura.	7	12
Can I still accept it?	7	12
I don't know. I'm supposed to speak to Diana.	7	12
Is your mother home?	7	12
You really should speak to my husband.	7	12
She's his ex-wife.	7	12
I guess if he knows where she is, I could come back...	7	12
or wait in the car.	7	12
My neighbors have seen you on the porch long enough.	7	12
Come on inside.	7	12
Have a seat. Would you like some iced tea?	7	12
- I don't wanna be a bother. - It's no bother.	7	12
I have to check on the chicken.	7	12
Are you looking for my mother?	7	12
Diana is your mother?	7	12
If she won something, I should get it.	7	12
Yes, that makes sense.	7	12
Sorry to keep you waiting.	7	12
It was no problem at all.	7	12
I hope you're finding everything satisfactory.	7	12
Well, I'm here because I need your help.	7	12
I'm at your disposal.	7	12
I don't know how to put this,	7	12
but I don't feel that my accounts	7	12
are getting the right kind of attention.	7	12
Our accounts.	7	12
Well, that's just it.	7	12
I fully expect to service clients	7	12
with the help of your personnel.	7	12
But as a partner at SC&P,	7	12
I had a certain amount of status.	7	12
You know, more independence.	7	12
What's the problem?	7	12
You can speak freely.	7	12
Well, I don't think that Ferg Donnelly is a good match.	7	12
Ferg's very important around here.	7	12
Frankly, you're lucky he's taken an interest in your business.	7	12
I understand that, but it's not necessary.	7	12
I don't mean to brag, but I've been handling this account on my own	7	12
since I brought it in	7	12
I'm sure that's true,	7	12
but you're gonna have to get used to	7	12
doing things the way we do them.	7	12
Well, I don't know how to say this, but I can't work with him.	7	12
Joan, it may not have sunk in, but your status has changed.	7	12
Avon, Butler Footwear, Topaz Pantyhose,	7	12
I guess you don't need those accounts.	7	12
(SIGHS)	7	12
I've tried to be patient...	7	12
but I don't care about your SC&P partnership.	7	12
I don't know if somebody left it to you in their will,	7	12
but your little stake doesn't mean anything here.	7	12
Is that what you want?	7	12
Because I'm perfectly happy to take	7	12
my half a million dollars and be on my way.	7	12
I'll bet people always say you're the kind of gal	7	12
who doesn't take no for an answer.	7	12
But no...	7	12
you're not telling me how to run my business.	7	12
Now, find a way to get along...	7	12
or you can expect a letter from our lawyer.	7	12
I wonder how many women around here	7	12
would like to speak to a lawyer.	7	12
I think the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has one.	7	12
Women love it here.	7	12
You want to threaten us?	7	12
You'll be all alone.	7	12
No.	7	12
I think the second I file a complaint, I'll have the ACLU in my office	7	12
and Betty Friedan in the lobby	7	12
with half the women who marched down Fifth Avenue.	7	12
I guess you didn't see the headlines	7	12
about what happened at Ladies' Home Journal.	7	12
Or Newsweek.	7	12
Do you have any idea	7	12
how much space McCann buys	7	12
in The New York Times every year?	7	12
We could get them to print Mein Kampf on the front page.	7	12
Yes, I'm sure I'll find it difficult to find a reporter	7	12
who wants to embarrass you this deeply.	7	12
Look,	7	12
you're unhappy,	7	12
and now I'm unhappy.	7	12
So, how about this?	7	12
I'm willing to give you 50 cents on the dollar...	7	12
to never see your face again.	7	12
I guess I wasn't clear.	7	12
I'm not negotiating.	7	12
Then you should get out of my office immediately.	7	12
Go ahead.	7	12
I'd rather give it to a lawyer.	7	12
So you get to drive all over America giving people prizes?	7	12
That sounds like fun.	7	12
Well, I also give	7	12
- a lot of boring presentations. - (DOOR OPENING)	7	12
(DOOR CLOSES)	7	12
- Hello. - Hello, honey.	7	12
This is Bill Phillips.	7	12
He says Diana won some kind of prize.	7	12
A refrigerator full of Miller Beer.	7	12
Really?	7	12
Well, there's been some confusion	7	12
because a Mrs. Diana Baur entered our contest,	7	12
and, well, she's nowhere to be found.	7	12
Diana never entered any contest.	7	12
Well, I guess it's a mistake.	7	12
Yeah...	7	12
letting you in our house.	7	12
And my wife, she doesn't know any better, but I guess you knew that.	7	12
- Cliff, please. - Let him answer.	7	12
Who the heck are you? Or do I have to call the police?	7	12
(SIGHS)	7	12
You're right.	7	12
I'm deeply sorry for the ruse, ma'am,	7	12
but I work for a collection agency.	7	12
Clearly you're not responsible for Mrs. Baur anymore,	7	12
but I need to know her whereabouts.	7	12
Last I heard, she was in New York.	7	12
- Do you have an address? - No.	7	12
That's all I got.	7	12
I apologize for the intrusion.	7	12
Guess we're not as dumb as you think we are.	7	12
I'm leaving.	7	12
The clothes, the shoes, the Caddy?	7	12
You're no collection agent.	7	12
I am.	7	12
You think you're the first one that came looking for her?	7	12
She's a tornado...	7	12
just leaving a trail of broken bodies behind her.	7	12
I didn't mean to disturb you.	7	12
Yeah, but you did.	7	12
I'm just starting to get back on my feet.	7	12
Just starting to get back to even part of the way to where I was.	7	12
Look, I'm sorry.	7	12
I was worried about her.	7	12
She seemed so lost.	7	12
I lost my daughter to God and my wife to the devil.	7	12
I lost everything.	7	12
Is that what you wanted to know?	7	12
No.	7	12
You can't save her.	7	12
Only Jesus can.	7	12
He'll help you, too.	7	12
Ask Him.	7	12
- Look, L“ - And don't come back.	7	12
Come on, once more from the top!	7	12
(ORGAN PLAYING)	7	12
(DOOR OPENS)	7	12
Where the hell have you been?	7	12
I had a lot of stuff to move.	7	12
Are any of you planning to work here,	7	12
or is this the con of the century?	7	12
Look, calm down. We're all just settling in.	7	12
Calm down? Where the hell is Don?	7	12
He walked out of a meeting Vvednesday	7	12
and hasn't come back.	7	12
He does that.	7	12
Well, you may have sold me a rotten apple,	7	12
but it's not too late to let the ax fly.	7	12
Starting with that redhead.	7	12
Joan?	7	12
I don't want to hear her name again.	7	12
Good morning. You made it.	7	12
You just come to work like nothing happened?	7	12
I'm here and I'm doing my job.	7	12
Get the door.	7	12
Jim Hobart's not afraid of you.	7	12
Then Why'd he send you?	7	12
To tell you I can't help you.	7	12
Well, thank you very much.	7	12
Listen to me.	7	12
You're not going to do better than 50 cents on the dollar.	7	12
It's not about the money.	7	12
It's only about the money.	7	12
Don't hide behind politics.	7	12
Take the money and be done with them.	7	12
Take half my money?	7	12
I know it's all my fault. And I'm trying to take care of it.	7	12
You've started something that could leave you with nothing.	7	12
It's plenty.	7	12
I made sure he's good for it.	7	12
(SIGHS)	7	12
Tell him he has a deal.	7	12
Where you headed?	7	12
St. Paul.	7	12
I can go that way.	7	12
Great.	7	12
I don't want to take you out of your way, man.	7	12
It's not a problem.	7	12

 I'm driving.	7	13
 Don't get smart with me.	7	13
 We've been looking for you.	7	13
 There's been a mistake.	7	13
 You knew we'd catch up with you eventually.	7	13
 ( truck rumbling )	7	13
 I can't find any baking soda.	7	13
 We're gonna have to make do with colgate.	7	13
 On my arm?	7	13
 Well, you're back early.	7	13
 Well, we had to skip lunch.	7	13
 - Hello, sherry. - Hello.	7	13
 I got stinged.	7	13
 Oh, sweetheart.	7	13
 We were up at lyman orchards. It's mostly bees.	7	13
 Daddy put toothpaste on it.	7	13
 Yes, and you're no worse for wear.	7	13
 Not allergic, thankfully.	7	13
 I'm terribly so.	7	13
 I have an hour. I suppose we could still grab lunch.	7	13
No, this is fine. She should probably rest.	7	13
 I'll see you Thursday, wonder woman.	7	13
 We'll go to friendly's.	7	13
 Well, I'm off.	7	13
 Go inside and lay down, sweetheart.	7	13
 Every time bill has the kids,	7	13
 Something terrible happens.	7	13
 ( laughs )	7	13
 The incredible thing is I make her lunch,	7	13
 I take her to school, I read to her every night,	7	13
 And he spends Sunday and Thursday night with her	7	13
 And that's all I hear about.	7	13
 Well, I admire you.	7	13
 Are you trying to get me to make you lunch?	7	13
 No, I think it's admirable	7	13
 That you haven't poisoned her against him.	7	13
 I don't know if I could have that restraint.	7	13
 Yes, you would.	7	13
 Because you'd be concerned about your child	7	13
 And do your best to forget things.	7	13
 And not expect your friends to remind you all the time.	7	13
 I am so sorry.	7	13
 That is not what I was trying to say.	7	13
 I know.	7	13
 Would you like some of these?	7	13
 So what happened to field hockey?	7	13
 If I'm on the yearbook, I won't be a benchwarmer.	7	13
 Well, can you quit before I buy you cleats and a stick next time?	7	13
 I'm going to sell everything.	7	13
 You know how much madrid's going to cost?	7	13
 I'm not gonna back out of that.	7	13
 I want to go to Spain.	7	13
 I want to go to Spain.	7	13
 You think it'll be more interesting than wyoming?	7	13
 I don't know. Wyoming had a two-headed cow.	7	13
 You'll see it on the postcard.	7	13
 So where's next?	7	13
 Well, I'm in kansas right now.	7	13
 I'm going to take route 35.	7	13
 Then over on 40.	7	13
 Then 89 to the grand canyon.	7	13
 I feel like I'm sitting right next to you.	7	13
 ( chuckles )	7	13
 Is it cold yet?	7	13
 A little. I wouldn't rush home.	7	13
 Well, I want to get your brothers before they go to sleep.	7	13
 I'll call you next week.	7	13
 I really want you to sell that equipment.	7	13
 You have no idea about money.	7	13
 I will. Bye.	7	13
 Bye, sweetheart.	7	13
 ( bell tolling )	7	13
 Are you lost?	7	13
 No, I'm a student here.	7	13
 Well, see you around.	7	13
 Oh!	7	13
Hey, give her some room.	7	13
 You okay, lady?	7	13
 Just my pride. New shoes.	7	13
 I think I need a minute.	7	13
 ( exhales )	7	13
 Duck, how are you?	7	13
 Fit as a fiddle, thank you.	7	13
 28th? That's top brass.	7	13
 Actually, it's none of your business.	7	13
 Don't be coy. You're helping them replace don, aren't you?	7	13
 - I've done it before. - ( elevator bell dings )	7	13
 Is it true he left behind a couple million bucks?	7	13
 ( elevator bell dings )	7	13
 Nice to see you.	7	13
 Actually, let me ask you something.	7	13
 Morning, john, norm.	7	13
 One month and you're already the mayor.	7	13
 They've been very hospitable.	7	13
 Of course I delivered everyone.	7	13
 I even brought burger chef back.	7	13
 And after joan cashed in, I saved avon.	7	13
 There have been whispers about coca-cola.	7	13
 No need to impress me.	7	13
 What do you want?	7	13
 Not here.	7	13
 This will just take a moment, sarah.	7	13
You can't be in here.	7	13
Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.	7	13
 You mind?	7	13
 They should always think you're unhappy.	7	13
 You're wrong. And for the first time, they don't.	7	13
 Now go outside and tell everyone you staggered into the wrong office.	7	13
 - They'll believe you. - Look, this isn't about you.	7	13
 I've been trying to get this private aviation company	7	13
 To have me do all their hiring.	7	13
 But before any of that happens,	7	13
 They want to review their overall strategy.	7	13
 So I want you to go to dinner and recommend	7	13
 That they hire an in-house senior marketing man.	7	13
 And I'm the guy to find him.	7	13
Because you're the best?	7	13
 Yes.	7	13
 And then you can extoll the wonders of mccann.	7	13
 Everybody wins.	7	13
 I don't need to poach.	7	13
 You know, I helped you for free after that stupid merger.	7	13
 And then you sent peggy to gerald what's-his-name when she was in need.	7	13
 This is how I make my living, pete.	7	13
 I've paid you at some point.	7	13
 You'd want this business if you knew you couldn't have it.	7	13
 Learjet is private, luxury air travel.	7	13
 Look, pete, I just have to fill this one position	7	13
 And I'll make it through the winter.	7	13
 For old times' sake.	7	13
 ( scoffs ) fine. Who is he?	7	13
 His name is mike sherman and he moved to wichita from philly four years ago.	7	13
 Princeton '52. You should have a lot in common.	7	13
 I'm dartmouth '56.	7	13
 I know that.	7	13
 Don't pretend like you're not gonna jack each other off.	7	13
 - Sarah. - Yes, mr. Campbell?	7	13
 Would you remind me that I need to make a donation to lincoln center?	7	13
 Mr. Phillips was very persuasive.	7	13
 Thank you for your generosity.	7	13
 Man on radio: Koma, fun-loving 1520.	7	13
 - The capital radio... - ( engine thumping )	7	13
 ...For the capital city, oklahoma city, oklahoma.	7	13
 ( jingle plays )	7	13
 Shit.	7	13
 Radio: Look for clear skies with a high temperature today of 75.	7	13
 A pleasant day here in this pleasant city.	7	13
 Current temperature is 73.	7	13
 Beautiful weather out there today.	7	13
Dr. Buckley will be right with you, mrs. Robinson.	7	13
 It's mrs. Francis.	7	13
Oh, the boys who dropped you off said that was your name.	7	13
 I think that was a joke.	7	13
 Oh.	7	13
Nurse, could you excuse us?	7	13
Mrs. Francis, is it possible to get your husband down here?	7	13
 I can drive with a broken rib.	7	13
 It's not even that sore.	7	13
 Well, I took a look at your x-ray	7	13
 And it may be more serious than just the rib.	7	13
 How serious?	7	13
 You can use the phone at the nurses' station.	7	13
I'm gonna sue them.	7	13
First I'm gonna go through the health commission	7	13
And I'm gonna look into their funding.	7	13
That quack has some nerve scaring you like that.	7	13
 What happens to my car?	7	13
I'll send my secretary up here in a cab tomorrow morning.	7	13
 And I'm gonna call-- call-- call jim.	7	13
 Call--	7	13
 You know what?	7	13
I'll just call rocky's office. That's what I'm gonna do.	7	13
 Henry, I want to go home.	7	13
 Babe, look at me.	7	13
 You're gonna be just fine.	7	13
 ( engine starts )	7	13
 Afternoon.	7	13
 Wyatt called from the service station.	7	13
 We've got our best available for you.	7	13
 If you threw a rod, it's gonna take some time.	7	13
 It's the rocker arm.	7	13
 Well, I've got a weekly for $37 or a daily for six.	7	13
 Let's take it a night at a time.	7	13
 I'm an optimist.	7	13
 Oh, hello.	7	13
 This is my wife sharon.	7	13
 Of the sharon motel.	7	13
 This is donald from new york.	7	13
 - Don. - Pleasure to have you with us.	7	13
 Do you know where I could get a meal?	7	13
 There's a cafe a couple of miles up the road.	7	13
 He's got car trouble.	7	13
 Well, I made a roast.	7	13
 How'd you like leftovers as room service?	7	13
 I don't want you to go to the trouble.	7	13
 Do you have vending machines?	7	13
 You can have both.	7	13
 Give him some change and have andy take his luggage.	7	13
 This is all I got.	7	13
 Here's two dimes and a nickel.	7	13
 There you go.	7	13
 I believe that's one of the best steaks I've ever had.	7	13
 Well, it's the best because they flew it out from kansas.	7	13
 Isn't wichita cattle country?	7	13
 It sure is.	7	13
But I was disappointed when I got there	7	13
That I didn't see more ten-gallon hats.	7	13
 ( chuckles ) but your company is very glamorous.	7	13
 As far as I can tell, its entire public reputation is based on hollywood.	7	13
Well, we thought we'd go with our most exciting customers.	7	13
 Elizabeth taylor. Danny kaye.	7	13
Somebody you want to meet?	7	13
 Not really.	7	13
 In fact, I think that's the problem if you have one.	7	13
I have one, or I wouldn't be talking to you.	7	13
 Corporate executives should be your core business.	7	13
 You can read that without glasses?	7	13
 I've looked at your business and I think duck's right.	7	13
 You need a senior marketing executive.	7	13
 And not just anyone.	7	13
 You need someone comfortable	7	13
 With the kind of boardroom leaders that see learjet as a tool,	7	13
 Not a frivolous extravagance for movie stars and their pets.	7	13
( laughs )	7	13
 Mccann could run circles around carson roberts.	7	13
 But we wouldn't even be interested	7	13
 Unless duck found the right man for your company.	7	13
 I don't understand.	7	13
 Are you advocating for your agency or for yourself?	7	13
 We're one and the same.	7	13
 Well, the jobs are not one and the same.	7	13
 You can't work for mccann and work for us.	7	13
 I'm aware of that.	7	13
But I couldn't agree with you more about who we need.	7	13
I told duck I was looking for a real knickerbocker.	7	13
 Right schools, right family.	7	13
 Someone who can rap his ring on the table	7	13
 And let everyone know they're with a friend.	7	13
 Well, I'm flattered.	7	13
 But I'm afraid duck phillips has tricked me into a job interview.	7	13
 I stand by my analysis,	7	13
 But I'm very happy where I am.	7	13
 I expect him to lie to me.	7	13
 I didn't expect him to lie to you.	7	13
 I'm glad we got to meet.	7	13
 Likewise. That's never a mistake.	7	13
 You want a brandy?	7	13
 Because duck's going to get the check.	7	13
 ( laughs )	7	13
 Doctor: Well, unfortunately, we've discovered	7	13
 That the cancer has spread from the lung	7	13
 And metastasized to the bones	7	13
 And to lymph nodes in the mediastinum.	7	13
 Henry: I don't understand what you're saying.	7	13
 It's aggressive and it's very advanced.	7	13
 I wish there was better news.	7	13
 What do we do?	7	13
 Well, I'm going to recommend a radiation oncologist	7	13
 For therapy to help mend the rib.	7	13
 It won't heal without it. Then a medical oncologist.	7	13
 She could have nine months to a year,	7	13
 But these treatments are usually palliative.	7	13
 I'm so sorry.	7	13
Cking )	7	13
 Oh, sorry about that.	7	13
 You should put the sign out.	7	13
 You're the maid?	7	13
 And the messenger.	7	13
 I guess they didn't know you were in here.	7	13
 Wyatt called. It's a bushing on the rocker arm,	7	13
 But it's got to come from tulsa.	7	13
 So I'm gonna need another book.	7	13
The chlorine's killed the piss in the pool by now.	7	13
You can go for a swim.	7	13
 Anything else to do around here?	7	13
 ( sighs )	7	13
 There's football at the high school Friday night.	7	13
 Revival church every night.	7	13
 Fairview's got a drive-in,	7	13
 But you don't have a car.	7	13
 Where can I get a drink?	7	13
 That's a little complicated.	7	13
 But I probably can rustle up a bottle.	7	13
 That'd be great.	7	13
 Andy.	7	13
 You want me to clean up?	7	13
 Don. Maybe tomorrow.	7	13
 - Man: There she is. - ( kids laughing )	7	13
 Man: Don't run.	7	13
 I'm in grand central. Come down.	7	13
 Only to throw you under a train.	7	13
 Come on.	7	13
 I only have one question.	7	13
 I better have gotten that lousy job.	7	13
 You did, and it's not lousy.	7	13
 I haven't even negotiated, we're already at 100 a year.	7	13
 All benefits and unlimited private jet travel.	7	13
 It's a flying limousine, pete.	7	13
 You can have lunch in new york and be back for dinner.	7	13
 Good, because I live here. I have to go.	7	13
 - He wants to have dinner with wives. - No.	7	13
 He's only meeting with you and one other guy.	7	13
 Two last-round dinners.	7	13
 Help me turn it into a horse race.	7	13
 How many times do you think you can lie to this man?	7	13
 We both told him you didn't want the job. What's the lie?	7	13
 Well, for one thing, I don't have a wife.	7	13
 For the other, I have four years left	7	13
 On my contract with mccann	7	13
 And a million dollars contingent on my presence.	7	13
 Uh-huh, so now we know there's a price.	7	13
 ( chuckles ) you're talking to yourself.	7	13
 Have dinner. Yuck it up.	7	13
 Don't you want to sign him one day?	7	13
You know the corporate royalty on those planes?	7	13
 7:30 Saturday.	7	13
 Grill room at the four seasons.	7	13
 Your wife's under the weather, but you didn't want to miss it.	7	13
There's two guys. Hy epstein wants to start treatment immediately	7	13
And he's conducting a study at new york hospital.	7	13
The other one--	7	13
Can't read my own writing.	7	13
 He's a surgeon. Very aggressive.	7	13
But he's in bethesda.	7	13
Stop brushing your hair. How's the rib gonna heal?	7	13
 My rib's not going to heal, henry.	7	13
 You can't waste any more time being in shock.	7	13
 - You have to do something. - Do what?	7	13
 What do you think would happen if nelson rockefeller got this?	7	13
 He would die!	7	13
Betty, do you want the kids to hear you talk that way?	7	13
 I don't want them to hear anything until I've decided what to tell them.	7	13
 That's what's on my mind, henry.	7	13
 Do you want to help with that, or do you want to keep chasing your tail?	7	13
 You're being morose.	7	13
 You're a very lucky woman. You have been your whole life.	7	13
 Stop yelling at me.	7	13
 ( knocking on door )	7	13
Thanks for the books.	7	13
 It's $10.	7	13
 I gave you $10.	7	13
 It was hard to get.	7	13
 ( scoffs )	7	13
 I'm not paying $20 for a bottle of whiskey	7	13
 And a couple of paperbacks somebody left behind.	7	13
 You've got the money.	7	13
 I walked into town. And it's hard for me.	7	13
 I got flatfeet.	7	13
 - You want one? - No, sir.	7	13
 I'm one-eighth comanche. Can't ever touch it.	7	13
 Folks know the hustle you're running out of their motel?	7	13
 My folks are over in woodward.	7	13
 And ain't none of their business how I get rich.	7	13
 That's true.	7	13
 How'd you get rich?	7	13
I was in the advertising business.	7	13
 You make commercials on tv?	7	13
 Lots of them.	7	13
 So many you don't have to work no more?	7	13
 Anymore.	7	13
 All right. Well, I'm around.	7	13
Don't forget to take the pie tammy made you.	7	13
 ( tv playing )	7	13
 Sorry to bother you, but my tv just died.	7	13
Oh, well, we'll get you a new one.	7	13
Soon as I'm done fighting this battle.	7	13
" ""harbor lights"" playing"	7	13
 There you go.	7	13
 Then it comes loose.	7	13
 ( dings )	7	13
 - You're the quick brown fox. - ( chuckles )	7	13
 Did you learn to type in the army?	7	13
 No, night school.	7	13
 Were you in the service?	7	13
 Yes.	7	13
 Well, everybody who's a vet and likes drinking	7	13
 Will be at the legion on Saturday night.	7	13
 My husband would be tickled if you joined him.	7	13
 Why didn't he ask me?	7	13
 Oh, he's gonna. Soon as he spies a chance.	7	13
 He could sure use someone new to tell his stories to.	7	13
 I don't know that I'll be here,	7	13
 Unless you know something about my car that I don't.	7	13
 Wyatt's gonna overcharge you, but he'll get the work done.	7	13
 Let's get that tv	7	13
 So you can get back to relaxing.	7	13
 ( distant train horn blaring )	7	13
 Hello?	7	13
 The whole pie is for you.	7	13
 Eat with me.	7	13
 There were two pies.	7	13
 I'm not gonna tell you what happened to the other one.	7	13
 I have a favor to ask of you.	7	13
 I can repay you.	7	13
 I'll take her for a weekend next month. You can go away.	7	13
 What?	7	13
 I have a dinner with a potential client	7	13
 And I'd love for you to join me.	7	13
 No.	7	13
Thankfully, that's no longer one of my obligations.	7	13
 You used to love it.	7	13
 I daresay it got you excited trying to close over coffee.	7	13
 I never closed anything.	7	13
 I was just trying to stay awake.	7	13
 Trudy, you understand my business.	7	13
 No one else ever really has.	7	13
Well, I'm not comfortable being your date under any circumstances.	7	13
 Well, then,	7	13
 How about for old times' sake?	7	13
 You know, I'm jealous of your ability	7	13
 To be sentimental about the past.	7	13
 I'm not able to do that.	7	13
 I remember things as they were.	7	13
 It's late.	7	13
 I'd like to turn off the lights.	7	13
 Well, good night, then.	7	13
 Good night.	7	13
 Because she got kicked out of brearley.	7	13
 - ( screams ) - hold on. Easy.	7	13
What are you doing here?	7	13
 You're not supposed to be in here.	7	13
 Could you leave us alone, sweetheart?	7	13
 Oh, of course.	7	13
 Come have a seat.	7	13
 I have some serious news.	7	13
 It's bad news.	7	13
 Your mother is sick.	7	13
 She has lung cancer and it's very advanced.	7	13
 I'm very sorry.	7	13
I've got to call her.	7	13
 She doesn't want you kids to know.	7	13
 Then why are you telling me?	7	13
 Because there's hope she could have more time.	7	13
 People do. It's a tough road, but it's a chance.	7	13
 Well, that's good.	7	13
 But she won't do it.	7	13
 I don't know if she's just being stubborn or vain,	7	13
 But she won't even hear of it.	7	13
 Henry, my ears are still buzzing.	7	13
 I don't understand you.	7	13
 I breached her confidence because I want you	7	13
 To talk some sense into her.	7	13
 She'll listen to you.	7	13
 I wouldn't know what to say.	7	13
 It's okay for you to cry, honey.	7	13
 ( crying )	7	13
 Jesus, what am I going to do?	7	13
How's she running?	7	13
 Good as new.	7	13
I suppose you're gonna be on your way, then.	7	13
 I should settle up.	7	13
Sure I can't talk you into joining us tonight?	7	13
 I should get going.	7	13
 Mister, I know you're not in a rush.	7	13
 We got plenty of tourists with cars in the shop.	7	13
 You made two phone calls in six days.	7	13
 Wyatt thought you ran away.	7	13
 I don't know.	7	13
 Tell you what.	7	13
 I'll throw in the room tonight	7	13
 And I'll give you another night if you fix the coke machine.	7	13
 I don't think I can help you with that.	7	13
 I know you were right about your car.	7	13
 And sharon said she caught you being handy.	7	13
 Don't they fix it?	7	13
 They want to give me a new one,	7	13
 But I like this one. I'll get my tools.	7	13
 Henry: Hello?	7	13
 Smells good.	7	13
 I brought you a surprise.	7	13
 Betty.	7	13
What are you doing here?	7	13
 I got in trouble at school again.	7	13
 What'd you do?	7	13
 I don't want to talk about it.	7	13
Are we supposed to eat?	7	13
 Genie, come over here.	7	13
" ""I like to dance the swedish waltz"" playing"	7	13
 So, I'm going to tell you in advance	7	13
 That I know we seem like fine people,	7	13
 But I've been a little dishonest.	7	13
 Okay.	7	13
 This is a fundraiser	7	13
 For al bettendorf over there.	7	13
 His house burned down. Well, the kitchen.	7	13
 The most expensive room.	7	13
 There's a fine jar.	7	13
 We're just strangers, but it does include barbecue	7	13
 And I'm getting your drinks.	7	13
 $40 for don!	7	13
 ( cheering )	7	13
 What's your rank and where did you serve?	7	13
 7th infantry. Korea.	7	13
 Rank?	7	13
 Lieutenant.	7	13
 Lieutenant, 7th infantry, korea.	7	13
 Man: Shit, we should be paying him.	7	13
 ( men laugh )	7	13
 That's $5 for swearing.	7	13
 What are you drinking?	7	13
 ( sighs )	7	13
 I'll just have the shrimp cocktail.	7	13
"Well, as mother used to say, ""you're not that fat."""	7	13
 ( laughs )	7	13
 No, I have a-- well, something came up.	7	13
 Since I invited you?	7	13
 You're always complaining we never see each other.	7	13
 Then I ask you to dinner, miss a very important meeting,	7	13
 And you have other plans?	7	13
 It was very short notice.	7	13
 If you need an alibi, you're going to have to ask.	7	13
 Please.	7	13
 Now, what did you want to talk about?	7	13
 Let me ask you something.	7	13
 How do you know when something's really an opportunity?	7	13
 I'm wrong sometimes,	7	13
 But the girls aren't shy nowadays.	7	13
 ( chuckles ) no, I meant in your career.	7	13
 Oh. Well, in banking there's a road and you just stay on it.	7	13
 Still, you're required to assess risk.	7	13
 Pete, I don't buy or sell anything.	7	13
 I just distribute and it's never up to me.	7	13
 Fine, forget your business.	7	13
 You're taking a risk tonight.	7	13
 So now you're jealous and you're trying to ruin my evening.	7	13
 Your wife knows.	7	13
 I'm not asking you to imagine it,	7	13
 I'm telling you she knows.	7	13
 And how do you feel now that you know that?	7	13
 Judy's always loved that I was attractive to other women.	7	13
 It's part of what she likes about me.	7	13
 I'm just supposed to turn that off?	7	13
 You're not supposed to act on it.	7	13
 But I always have. That's the way we are.	7	13
 But why? Always looking for something better.	7	13
 Always looking for something else.	7	13
 Because dad was like that.	7	13
 He really was, wasn't he?	7	13
 You know, once at the polo grounds,	7	13
 Some jeweler thanked him profusely for buying a diamond necklace.	7	13
 Dad got very cross and called off the sale right in front of me.	7	13
 He kept muttering how the man was indiscreet.	7	13
 I looked it up.	7	13
 I didn't need any detective work.	7	13
 I just saw the way women looked at him.	7	13
 You really think she knows?	7	13
 I think it feels good and then it doesn't.	7	13
 ( sighs ) I have to make a phone call.	7	13
 Don't listen to me.	7	13
 I'll be right back.	7	13
 And wayne's dad ran the drugstore before wayne.	7	13
He was all 10 commandments rolled into one.	7	13
 ( laughs )	7	13
 He caught us smoking, stealing, cussing.	7	13
 My wife went to high school with these two.	7	13
 They were hooligans.	7	13
 I didn't break the real commandments till I was in europe.	7	13
 Were you in europe, don?	7	13
Don was in korea.	7	13
 You don't just need new glasses, you need a new hearing aid.	7	13
 Well, he hasn't said anything.	7	13
 Did you introduce him to--	7	13
 Hey, jerry! Jerry fandango!	7	13
 Get over here.	7	13
Jerry served in korea.	7	13
So, you know, maybe you've seen him before.	7	13
 What the ( inaudible ) do you farts want?	7	13
 - Gerald fanning, this is-- - don was in korea.	7	13
 You two can reminisce.	7	13
 I don't want to talk about it.	7	13
 Jerry fanning. Pfc, 34th infantry.	7	13
 Come on, let me see your face.	7	13
 When and where?	7	13
 It was before they called it a war. Near the yalu river.	7	13
 Oh, hell.	7	13
 I wasn't there till christmas '53.	7	13
 I was home by then.	7	13
 Have a seat.	7	13
 No, I got one.	7	13
 Tell you one thing about korea.	7	13
 They can keep it.	7	13
 ( drums beating )	7	13
 ( drumroll )	7	13
 ( cheering )	7	13
 ( whistling )	7	13
 ( cheering )	7	13
 ( drums playing )	7	13
( tv playing )	7	13
 ( banging on door )	7	13
 ( banging )	7	13
 Go away.	7	13
Duck: What the hell happened to you?	7	13
You stood me up.	7	13
 Get in here.	7	13
 I never said I would go.	7	13
 You did, and mike was waiting with charlene at the grill room	7	13
 For an hour!	7	13
 For heaven's sake, you're drunk.	7	13
 And you're being very menacing right now.	7	13
 I'm happy. Listen to me.	7	13
 You're on a streak.	7	13
 You're on one of those magic--	7	13
 We used to call it a trend.	7	13
 You know, because of the graph where the line just goes up.	7	13
 I don't know what you're talking about.	7	13
 Mike called me from his hotel room.	7	13
 He was pretty sore.	7	13
 So I told him that you wanted to come,	7	13
 But you were insulted by the offer.	7	13
 - You what? - He wants to do it all.	7	13
 Company car, company plane, signing bonus.	7	13
 And he's gonna get you out of mccann.	7	13
 He's gonna give me a million dollars?	7	13
 He's gonna get very close with stock options	7	13
 And mccann's gonna cut a deal for the rest	7	13
 Because you're gonna help them.	7	13
 Learjet's a tiny account. It's peanuts to them.	7	13
 You're not the client. Your passengers are.	7	13
 Jim hobart's very excited about who flies on those planes.	7	13
 Every important ceo in america.	7	13
 You talked to jim hobart?	7	13
 You know what $100 buys you in wichita?	7	13
 A two-bedroom house.	7	13
 You stupid wino.	7	13
 You're going to destroy everything!	7	13
 Who's going to win the world series this year?	7	13
 I don't know.	7	13
 You are! ( laughs )	7	13
 Because you are charmed, my friend.	7	13
 Good night, duck.	7	13
 I've been there. It doesn't last long.	7	13
" So the doctor says, ""sorry, son,"	7	13
 But your pecker's got gangrene.	7	13
" We're gonna have to amputate."""	7	13
 ( laughs )	7	13
 So the gi goes to the jap doctor.	7	13
" ""oh, good news. No need to amputate."	7	13
" In three days will fall off by itself."""	7	13
 ( laughing )	7	13
 To don!	7	13
 For being generous and not saying shit.	7	13
 I don't know that many jokes.	7	13
Oh, just leave him alone.	7	13
 Don, you're not allowed to say,	7	13
" ""I don't want to talk about it"" in this place."	7	13
 That's why I never joined.	7	13
 You're not listening to me.	7	13
You're among friends.	7	13
 Floyd, tell him.	7	13
 - Floyd! - What?	7	13
 Tell him about the hurtgen forest.	7	13
 Give me a drink.	7	13
Tell him the story first.	7	13
 ( sighs ) oh, shit.	7	13
 You know where it is?	7	13
 It's on the border between belgium and germany.	7	13
 ( sighs )	7	13
 We were cut off.	7	13
 Three of us.	7	13
 Actually...	7	13
 There were nine of us originally.	7	13
 ( sighs )	7	13
 We came on a machine gun nest.	7	13
 There were four krauts in there looking to surrender.	7	13
 They had their hands in the air with their papers.	7	13
 They were starving. Don't skip that.	7	13
 We were starving.	7	13
 Scrounging for grub.	7	13
 We were boiling bark.	7	13
 So there's three of us,	7	13
 Four of them,	7	13
 And more snow coming.	7	13
 You did what you had to do.	7	13
 What did you do?	7	13
 Someone made them start digging.	7	13
 And we bounced them.	7	13
 One at a time.	7	13
 Took a couple of hours.	7	13
 One of them was so skinny, he tried to run away,	7	13
 His pants fell down.	7	13
 You know they all got blue eyes.	7	13
 You just do what you have to do to come home.	7	13
 I killed my co.	7	13
We were under fire.	7	13
Fuel was everywhere.	7	13
And I dropped my lighter.	7	13
And I blew him apart.	7	13
And I got to go home.	7	13
 That is the name of the game.	7	13
Hey, where is that kid?	7	13
 We need a bottle over here!	7	13
 Over here!	7	13
 - Over here! - ( men laughing )	7	13
¶ get that kid with the booze over here... ¶	7	13
 ( chuckles )	7	13
 ¶ 'cause the yanks are coming ¶	7	13
 ¶ the yanks are coming ¶	7	13
 ¶ the drums rum-tumming everywhere ¶	7	13
 ¶ over there, over there ¶	7	13
 ¶ send the word, send the word over there ¶	7	13
 ¶ 'cause the yanks are coming ¶	7	13
 ¶ the yanks are coming ¶	7	13
 ¶ the drums rum-tumming everywhere... ¶	7	13
 ( door opens )	7	13
 - Did I wake you? - No.	7	13
 Henry shouldn't have scared you.	7	13
 I wanted to tell you myself.	7	13
 He doesn't know you won't get treatment	7	13
 Because you love the tragedy.	7	13
 ( sighs ) sally, I've learned	7	13
 To believe people when they tell you it's over.	7	13
 They don't want to say it, so it's usually the truth.	7	13
 Henry said you could have a year.	7	13
 And what would that year be like?	7	13
 I'll be with you.	7	13
 I won't let you give up.	7	13
 I know that.	7	13
 But I watched my mother die.	7	13
 I won't do that to you.	7	13
 And I don't want you to think I'm a quitter.	7	13
 I fought for plenty in my life.	7	13
 That's how I know when it's over.	7	13
 It's not a weakness.	7	13
 It's been a gift to me.	7	13
 To know when to move on.	7	13
 These are instructions.	7	13
 Open it the minute you know I'm gone.	7	13
 - No. - Listen to me.	7	13
 Things happen very quickly when people die.	7	13
 Henry's not going to be able to handle things.	7	13
 You're going back to school in the morning.	7	13
 I don't want you alarming your brothers.	7	13
 Go back to sleep.	7	13
 - ( footsteps ) - ( voices whispering )	7	13
 ( keys rattling )	7	13
 What the hell?	7	13
 We want our money.	7	13
 What?	7	13
 We know you took the money.	7	13
 Let me go! Sharon, what's going on?	7	13
 Your car was fixed. You should have been on your way.	7	13
 Now, I don't know who the hell you are,	7	13
 But you've got five mississippi to get our money back.	7	13
 I didn't take your money.	7	13
 You threw all that money around	7	13
 'cause you knew you'd get it back.	7	13
 ( grunts )	7	13
 I mean business!	7	13
 You really think I need your spare change?	7	13
 Give us the cash and you can have your car back.	7	13
 - Probably stolen. - We'll find out.	7	13
 ( door closes )	7	13
 ( knocking )	7	13
 My god, what's wrong?	7	13
 I need to speak with you.	7	13
 My goodness, it's 4:00 in the morning.	7	13
 Is everything all right?	7	13
 You're scaring me. Please, what is it?	7	13
 It's good news. Catch your breath.	7	13
 ( exhales ) what on earth is going on?	7	13
 I was offered a job tonight.	7	13
 Because its origins were supernatural,	7	13
 I realized that its benefits might be as well.	7	13
 I want you and tammy to come with me.	7	13
 I want you to relocate to wichita, pick out a house,	7	13
 And be my wife and family again.	7	13
 Peter, I'm not dismissing you...	7	13
 I'm saying with respect to whatever	7	13
 Is happening in your eyes right now,	7	13
 We both know things can't be undone.	7	13
 Says who?	7	13
 We're not even through half our lives.	7	13
 And even if we are, we're entitled to more.	7	13
 Of what?	7	13
 Then we're entitled to something new.	7	13
 I want to start over.	7	13
 And I know I can.	7	13
 I'm not so dumb anymore.	7	13
 I'm not ignoring the fact that I could actually lose your love.	7	13
 You never lost it.	7	13
 But I will never allow you to hurt me again.	7	13
 I love you, too.	7	13
 I always have.	7	13
 I've never loved anyone else.	7	13
 Never.	7	13
 ( sighs )	7	13
 You think you can come in here	7	13
 When I'm all disoriented	7	13
 And say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago	7	13
 And make me run away with you?	7	13
 I said it to you 10 years ago and I'll say it again.	7	13
 I do.	7	13
 Wichita is beautiful.	7	13
 And wholesome.	7	13
 And not the city and not cos cob.	7	13
 And you'll have a plane to use at your disposal.	7	13
 We will.	7	13
 To pick up and go anywhere anytime we want.	7	13
 Like driving to montauk.	7	13
 I want to go everywhere with you.	7	13
 Say yes with your voice, not just your eyes.	7	13
 Oh!	7	13
 ( breathing heavily )	7	13
 How will I explain this to tammy?	7	13
 Tell her her birthday wish came true.	7	13
 I'm gonna go.	7	13
 And we're gonna have dinner on Saturday night.	7	13
 The three of us.	7	13
 Like it was the first time.	7	13
 Good morning.	7	13
( knocking )	7	13
 This one's on the house.	7	13
What do you want to know? You want to know what I told them?	7	13
 I'm just being a good citizen, man.	7	13
You don't know anything about me. I could kill you right now.	7	13
 You took that money and you set me up.	7	13
 I don't know what you're talking about.	7	13
 You have shitty instincts for a con man.	7	13
 You're lucky you feel guilty.	7	13
 That's the one difference between you and those animals right now.	7	13
 I don't feel guilty taking that drunk's money.	7	13
 He burned his own house down.	7	13
 He doesn't deserve a pot to piss in, let alone 500 bucks.	7	13
 You're gonna get me that money,	7	13
 Pack your bag, and get out of town.	7	13
 I can't leave without that money.	7	13
 I know you think you know how to hustle,	7	13
 But this is a big crime, stealing these people's money.	7	13
 If you keep it, you'll have to become somebody else.	7	13
 And it's not what you think it is.	7	13
 You cannot get off on that foot in this life.	7	13
 What do you care?	7	13
 You got money. I know you got money.	7	13
 I cleaned your room and didn't take nothing.	7	13
 Anything.	7	13
 You think this town is bad now?	7	13
 Wait until you can never come back.	7	13
 Can I go?	7	13
 Go get the money.	7	13
 I'm not paying for the room.	7	13
 Could you drop me off at the bus stop?	7	13
 ( sighs )	7	13
 Get in.	7	13
 I'm off.	7	13
 - Where are you going? - I have class.	7	13
 Why are you doing that?	7	13
 Why was I ever doing it?	7	13

Yes.	7	14
Sweetheart, I have some sad news.	7	14
Is he dead?	7	14
Don? No.	7	14
I don't think so. I think we would have heard about that.	7	14
Oh.	7	14

Well, I hope he's in a better place.	7	14
He's not dead. Stop saying that.	7	14
There are a lot of better places than here.	7	14
(SIGHS) I'll give you the recommendation he would have.	7	14
I know you'll land on your feet.	7	14
I always do.	7	14
So, that covers Del Monte, Roman Meal,	7	14
and Diamond Walnuts.	7	14
Bon appetit. That is all the accounts, all assigned.	7	14
And don't ask me again about S.O. Research and Engineering.	7	14
It's over.	7	14
(EVERYONE MURMERING)	7	14
Why did they take us off Chevalier?	7	14
Did Ted say anything to you about it?	7	14
Ted's not the creative director. They moved it to David's group.	7	14
Does David know they took us off?	7	14
(SIGHS) There's plenty to go around.	7	14
It's done. You have four good accounts. Get to work.	7	14
Lorraine, do you have a moment?	7	14
Not really.	7	14
Why are we off Chevalier?	7	14
Because Stu Riley took over from Pete Campbell	7	14
and he has his favorites.	7	14
I thought David wanted us on it.	7	14
I guess he didn't.	7	14
Well, does he know?	7	14
I don't know.	7	14
Why don't I call David and let him know you're unhappy?	7	14
You know what, Lorraine?	7	14
Call David.	7	14
In fact, why don't we go over and see him right now?	7	14
I'm sure he'd love to get involved.	7	14
Fine. You want it, you can have it.	7	14
Thanks so much.	7	14
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)	7	14
- You hung up my jeans. - Mmm.	7	14
I like having a man to take care of.	7	14
My wallet didn't happen to fall out, did it?	7	14
What the hell does that mean?	7	14
Should I go look?	7	14
Maybe I wanted to know who you were.	7	14
Everybody thinks you're from Detroit,	7	14
come to steal their secrets.	7	14
Did you leave me anything?	7	14
You've never paid for it, huh?	7	14
I have and I will. I just like it to be voluntary.	7	14
Get your purse.	7	14
(SIGHS)	7	14
Could have asked me.	7	14
That's never worked.	7	14
Whose ring is that?	7	14
(CHUCKLES)	7	14
Weren't you gonna steal it?	7	14
(TITTE RS)	7	14
Thank you.	7	14
We're leaving tomorrow.	7	14
You know we're going to beat those postcards home.	7	14
I want them to say Key West.	7	14
Who gave you cocaine as a birthday present?	7	14
My old partner. It's all over Malibu.	7	14
We said we'd try everything.	7	14
Okay.	7	14
I think you're supposed to sniff it off your fingernail.	7	14
(SNIFFS) Mmm.	7	14
Okay, my turn.	7	14
(SNIFFS)	7	14
(SNIFFS)	7	14
(COUGHS)	7	14
Oh!	7	14
That's fast.	7	14
I feel like someone just gave me some very good news.	7	14
You know, we could live like this all the time.	7	14
You just enjoy corrupting me.	7	14
Not the cocaine.	7	14
I'm talking about taking advantage of all I have.	7	14
All you have.	7	14
You should be spoiled.	7	14
I couldn't be more spoiled.	7	14
The way I've been living in New York,	7	14
it's hard to tell when the vacation started.	7	14
Kevin's going to school soon, so I know you have to be in one place,	7	14
but, if you think about it, why does that place have to be New York?	7	14
There are good schools everywhere and you hate your mother.	7	14
I don't hate her.	7	14
Is that all you heard?	7	14
You're cheating yourself. That tiny apartment.	7	14
I don't wanna make plans, but we could get a place in the mountains	7	14
or the country. Or a place in the mountains and the country.	7	14
Have you been looking for a place?	7	14
It's a hobby.	7	14
I mean I guess what I'm trying to say is	7	14
I want you to let yourself have a future with me.	7	14
Do you wanna get married?	7	14
Sure. If you do.	7	14
But it seems to me, your life is undeveloped property.	7	14
You can turn it into anything you want. It's got a hell of a view.	7	14
Do we have to get married?	7	14
Hell, no.	7	14
I want you so much right now.	7	14
(JOAN GIGGLES)	7	14
I'm sorry. I got held up.	7	14
No, I'm sorry.	7	14
Samsonite is shooting tomorrow and they changed everything.	7	14
I feel horrible, but I'm afraid it's just you and Harry for lunch.	7	14
That's my going away present?	7	14
What else did you get?	7	14
The account girls got a little sentimental.	7	14
Sarah baked cookies.	7	14
And this is a cactus.	7	14
What's that have to do with Kansas?	7	14
I don't know. Do you want it? I have a five-year-old.	7	14
Let's go. I'm starving.	7	14
She's not coming. She has work to do.	7	14
Don't do that.	7	14
You know who I was gonna have lunch with?	7	14
Someone important?	7	14
Doesn't anything mean anything to you?	7	14
Here, this will hold you over. I'll meet you by the elevator.	7	14
He acts like we're the Three Musketeers.	7	14
We've never had lunch.	7	14
I just wanted to say that I'm very happy for you.	7	14
And everyone's going to miss you,	7	14
who doesn't hate you for getting that big job.	7	14
Well, you're doing fine.	7	14
Keep it up, you'll be a creative director by 1980.	7	14
God, that sounds like a long time.	7	14
I'm telling you, it will happen.	7	14
They just have to get used to the idea.	7	14
Someday, people are gonna brag that they worked with you.	7	14
What am I supposed to say to that?	7	14
I don't know. No one's ever said it to me.	7	14
A thing like that.	7	14
I'll be back.	7	14
That thing better be alive.	7	14
So, you're in Utah?	7	14
I sent you a clipping.	7	14
They broke the land speed record right up in Bonneville.	7	14
Uh-huh.	7	14
622 miles an hour in a car that looked like a jet.	7	14
Sally?	7	14
I'm glad you're having fun.	7	14
Sorry, I already went to high school.	7	14
L Qot to go.	7	14
Hold on.	7	14
What's wrong?	7	14
It's nothing.	7	14
Boy problems?	7	14
I'm not supposed to tell you.	7	14
What?	7	14
Mom's dying.	7	14
(SIGHS)	7	14
Look, your mother's a hypochondriac. Don't go off the deep end.	7	14
Dad, listen to me.	7	14
She has lung cancer. The doctors gave her six months to live.	7	14
What?	7	14
She doesn't want you to know, but I just thought...	7	14
No, you did the right thing. I'm coming home.	7	14
No, I'm telling you because she wants Gene and Bobby to live with Uncle William.	7	14
Don't worry, you're all going to live with me. I promise.	7	14
Let me finish. I've thought about this more than you have.	7	14
You have to tell her that	7	14
you think it's best that they stay with Henry.	7	14
No.	7	14
Daddy, it's going to be so hard for them already.	7	14
They should at least be in the same bed and at the same school.	7	14
Sally, grown-ups make these decisions.	7	14
Do you understand I'm betraying her confidence?	7	14
I'm not being dramatic. Now, please, take me seriously.	7	14
(SIGHS)	7	14
- I have to go. - Hold on.	7	14
Please, I can't talk right now.	7	14
Sally, wait a minute.	7	14

Francis residence.	7	14
I have a person-to-person call for Betty Francis	7	14
from Donald Draper.	7	14
This is she. I'll accept.	7	14
Hello, Don.	7	14
- Don't you want the boys? - No.	7	14
You know I talked to Sally, don't you?	7	14
Yes, of course.	7	14
I'm coming home.	7	14
You are definitely not!	7	14
I want to be there. The kids need me.	7	14
I don't want to upset them.	7	14
It's my business.	7	14
I didn't even want her to know,	7	14
but no one can keep their mouth shut.	7	14
I don't want you to worry about them.	7	14
They'll going to come live with me. You don't even have to ask.	7	14
I wasn't going to.	7	14
Please don't let your pride interfere with my wishes.	7	14
I'm their father.	7	14
What they really need is a woman in their life.	7	14
A regular family.	7	14
Living with my brother and Judy is in their best interests.	7	14
You don't have the right to decide.	7	14
What am I supposed to do?	7	14
This way you see them exactly as much as you do now,	7	14
on weekends and...	7	14
Oh, wait, Don. When was the last time you saw them?	7	14
Betty, I didn't know.	7	14
Don, honey, I appreciate your intentions. I really do.	7	14
But I'm not going to waste the rest of my time arguing about this.	7	14
I want to keep things as normal as possible	7	14
and you not being here is part of that.	7	14
(WHIMPERS)	7	14
Birdie...	7	14
I know.	7	14
(SNIFFS)	7	14
I have to go.	7	14

Okay.	7	14

- How was Florida? - Compelling.	7	14
I assume you held on to your Rolodex when you retired?	7	14
Can I taste the wine first?	7	14
(CHUCKLES)	7	14
You know, you look great.	7	14
(LAUGHS)	7	14
Thank you.	7	14
What do you want?	7	14
Every department at Dow department has to make an industrial film	7	14
for the national sales meeting, and our scriptjust came in.	7	14
I fell asleep on page two of thirty.	7	14
How long is this film?	7	14
See? You know that.	7	14
The producer's as drunk as a skunk. I have to replace him.	7	14
Do you remember the name of the guy who produced Birds Eye?	7	14
I'm sure I have his number somewhere.	7	14
It's $50,000 for eight minutes.	7	14
A good producer could pocket half of it,	7	14
but he has to know writers and directors.	7	14
And I need it yesterday.	7	14
Joan, I can't be eclipsed by plastics and packaging again.	7	14
Relax, Kenny.	7	14
For that kind of money, there'll be ten men for the job.	7	14
Great. So, how's the family?	7	14
Wonderful. How's Eddie?	7	14
He's a little weird, actually.	7	14
I think there might be something wrong with him.	7	14
(LAUGHS)	7	14
(KNOCKING)	7	14
Come in.	7	14
We can't ask him for money like this.	7	14

You don't have to come along, but you promised to stake us.	7	14
I'm coming. I'm coming.	7	14
Should we pack you?	7	14
(DON BREATHING DEEPLY)	7	14
I'm packed. You can drop me in L.A.	7	14
Hello, big shot.	7	14
I was hoping we could grab lunch or a drink and catch up.	7	14
It's so good to hear from you. I thought you forgot about me.	7	14
How about the end of next week?	7	14
I can't wait. ls your weekend busy?	7	14
You really want to catch up?	7	14
Well, I ran into Ken, and...	7	14
Oh, how is he? Did you tell him I said hi?	7	14
Why would you do that?	7	14
Dow needs a script yesterday for an industrial film.	7	14
You know the account and, well, we both thought of you.	7	14
I don't have time to moonlight.	7	14
It's $1,200 for a ten page script.	7	14
Jeez.	7	14
Well, anything for a friend.	7	14
We can chat when I drop off the research.	7	14
Obviously, not there.	7	14
Of course.	7	14

Hello.	7	14
What are you doing here? How'd you find me?	7	14
I was in L.A. I called your folks.	7	14
They told me you were in town.	7	14
Uh-huh.	7	14
And they sent you here for what?	7	14
They didn't tell me anything but your address.	7	14
Patty's pretty mad I gave you money.	7	14
Well, that's more than she did.	7	14
Do you have any liquor? I've been drinking beer all night.	7	14
Sit down. I'll make coffee.	7	14
(EXHALES)	7	14
What's going on?	7	14
Nothing much. I'm retired.	7	14
Been on the road.	7	14
Just wanted to see how you were doing.	7	14
Meet the little one.	7	14
This is bullshit.	7	14
Did they fly you in from some drunk tank to make me feel guilty?	7	14
Stephanie, no.	7	14
What happened?	7	14
He's not here. He lives with Ronnie's parents. His dad.	7	14
I understand.	7	14
Listen.	7	14
I also thought...	7	14
This should be with you.	7	14
Megan and I are, well...	7	14
I'm sorry about that.	7	14
Anna always wanted you to have it.	7	14
Come on, Dick. What am I going to do with that?	7	14
Fine. Sell it.	7	14
Is that the problem? You need money?	7	14

I appreciate you trying to help me out,	7	14
but I'm pretty sure you're the one who's in trouble.	7	14
A lot has happened.	7	14
You're welcome to crash here.	7	14
I'm going away for a few days.	7	14
I don't wanna put you out. Just need a shower and a shave.	7	14
Where you going?	7	14
Up the coast.	7	14
It's some kind of retreat.	7	14
Why don't you close your eyes? I'll open a can of stew.	7	14
Okay.	7	14

I'm trying to make you happy.	7	14
That was our agreement.	7	14

You're done with Canada.	7	14
My children live there. You'll learn to love it.	7	14
As long as I don't have to see what's-his-name.	7	14
Poor soul. He suddenly discovered that he wants me.	7	14
You saw Emile?	7	14
Oh, he was such a tragic figure.	7	14
I hope you told him it's too late.	7	14
Not everything is your business.	7	14
Wait. Did you sleep with him?	7	14
Don't raise your voice. You're not my husband.	7	14
You went up there to divorce him. I forbid you to see him.	7	14
You are the one that'll throw me over and leave me for your secretary.	7	14
You know what a low blow is?	7	14
"All I got was ""suitcase."" Yell at me slower or in English."	7	14
You live in a hotel. Go get another room.	7	14

No.	7	14

Where are they?	7	14
Henry's still at work. She's lying down.	7	14
That's all she can do.	7	14
I don't know what she thinks I think,	7	14
but I heard everything before they stopped fighting.	7	14
(SIGHS)	7	14
I don't know how long she has,	7	14
but I'm not going to Madrid anymore.	7	14
She's not going to like that.	7	14
What happened in here? Smells like a fire.	7	14
I was making dinner.	7	14
Get the frying pan. I'll show you how to do it.	7	14
- There's someone in here. - It's more communal this way.	7	14
Sun salutation's at dawn, with yoga and tai chi.	7	14
A silent meal at 7:00 a.m. and the seminars begin at 9:00.	7	14
Get some rest. Tomorrow is going to be beautiful.	7	14
You are so generous.	7	14
Where are we?	7	14
"""Psychotechnics? Anxiety and Tension Control?"	7	14

I had pancakes.	7	14
- Do you have a minute? - Of course.	7	14
(CLEARS THROAT)	7	14
Look, I've been revising my will, and with Margaret lost,	7	14
I'm dividing most of my estate between Ellery and...	7	14
Roger.	7	14
I know you don't want it, but it's for him.	7	14
I don't want it to put you in an awkward position	7	14
when some man you used to work with	7	14
leaves your son a small fortune.	7	14
The good doctor, for example.	7	14
Greg had twins with some nurse.	7	14
As far as he's concerned, Kevin never happened.	7	14
So, he knows?	7	14
No, he's just a terrible person.	7	14
What about the guy you've been hiding from me?	7	14
Richard is a man of the world.	7	14
Roger, this is an expensive way to mark your territory.	7	14
What? No.	7	14
I've just been thinking that	7	14
you get to a point in your life where it's the last chapter...	7	14
Are you ill? ls everything okay?	7	14
For the time being, but I'm getting married.	7	14
Well, those skirts are pretty short at McCann.	7	14
Nah, I met her through Megan Draper.	7	14
She's old enough to be her mother.	7	14
Actually, she is her mother.	7	14
(BOTH LAUGH)	7	14
That's spectacular. What a mess.	7	14
You'd be surprised. Nobody cares.	7	14
I guess somebody finally got their timing right.	7	14
So, you'll accept?	7	14
If this is what you really want, I'm not going to say no.	7	14
It would be a relief to know that,	7	14
no matter what, our beautiful little boy is secure.	7	14
Good.	7	14
(SIGHS) Get over here.	7	14
Little rich bastard.	7	14
He really is, I guess.	7	14

Thank you.	7	14
I didn't want to leave it in the room.	7	14
Be open.	7	14
Let's go.	7	14
That's right. Just walk around the room.	7	14
No aiming.	7	14
No purpose,	7	14
other than to move your legs.	7	14
That's it.	7	14
Stop.	7	14
Look at the person nearest you.	7	14
What does that person make you feel?	7	14
Now, find a way, without words,	7	14
to communicate that feeling to the other person.	7	14
Does hugging feel honest?	7	14
(BOTH LAUGHING)	7	14
So happy to see you.	7	14
Me, you, as well.	7	14
That's not the only reason I came.	7	14
Can we get a couple of Bloody Marys?	7	14
Holy shit.	7	14
That's the tip of the iceberg, Peggy.	7	14
I never know if that's good or bad.	7	14
The director, Jeff Dole, has two more industrials	7	14
and he's asked me to produce them.	7	14
And they both need scripts.	7	14
And when Ken turned your idea in,	7	14
they put him in charge of the corporate presentation.	7	14
It's got a $60,000 budget.	7	14
I already have a very demanding job.	7	14
Do you have a contract?	7	14
I really thought you'd be on a beach by now.	7	14
I've been to the beach.	7	14
But when I talked to Ken,	7	14
I realized it would be easy to turn this	7	14
into an actual production company.	7	14
Eventually, I could hire writers to help you with the work load.	7	14
(LAUGHS) Slow down.	7	14
Harris-Olson.	7	14
You need two names to make it sound real.	7	14
Are you serious?	7	14
Could you give us a minute?	7	14
We won't answer to anyone.	7	14
It'll be something of ours, with our name on it.	7	14
I'm so flattered.	7	14
So?	7	14
I don't know.	7	14
I can't believe you're hesitating.	7	14
How can you work at that place?	7	14
It's a huge decision.	7	14
Well, you can think about it,	7	14
but I need to find someone by the end of the week.	7	14
Find a partner?	7	14
Find a writer.	7	14
The partnership is just for you.	7	14
You don't have to say why you're here.	7	14
Why don't you tell me how you're feeling right now?	7	14
I feel like	7	14
everyone's judging me.	7	14
And how does it feel to tell us that?	7	14
Like I'm a little girl and my parents are looking at me	7	14
the way that they look at me now.	7	14
Like all I do is screw up.	7	14
"""You shouldn't have dropped out of school."	7	14
"""You shouldn't have been with a lowlife."	7	14
"""Shouldn't have gotten pregnant."	7	14
"""You should have loved being a mother."""	7	14
"Life is full of ""shoulds."""	7	14
Yeah, but I made a mistake,	7	14
and I just want to get it together now.	7	14
So you can be with your baby?	7	14
What? No.	7	14
See? They are judging me.	7	14
Why don't you tell Angie how it feels to hear her say that?	7	14
It makes me feel small and insignificant, Angie.	7	14
What I feel when I hear about your baby	7	14
is sadness.	7	14
My mother left, and I can tell you	7	14
that your baby is gonna spend the rest of his life	7	14
staring at the door	7	14
waiting for you to walk in.	7	14

how this is making me feel?	7	14
(SOBBING)	7	14
Don't listen to them.	7	14
You think this is a big laugh, don't you?	7	14
You weren't raised with Jesus.	7	14
You don't know what happens to people	7	14
when they believe in things.	7	14
It's true. You think that I don't want to hear the truth?	7	14
I could help you.	7	14
I could move to L.A.	7	14
I don't know what you're doing.	7	14
You show up with some family heirloom.	7	14
You're not my family. What's the matter with you?	7	14
I just know how people work.	7	14
You can put this behind you.	7	14
It'll get easier as you move forward.	7	14
Oh, Dick, I don't think you're right about that.	7	14
I have to lie down. I'll see you after dinner.	7	14
I'm going to split.	7	14
Well, I'm going to sit here and look at these four walls.	7	14
(LAUGHS) If you're not gonna work, I can try and catch up.	7	14
Get the door.	7	14
Do you like it here?	7	14
(CHUCKLES)	7	14
Yeah. It's grown on me.	7	14
Joan said she wants to go into business.	7	14
She's going to be a producer	7	14
and I'd be her partner.	7	14
Oh.	7	14
You don't like that?	7	14
I can have my name on the door, be my own boss.	7	14
That's not a good reason.	7	14
You think it'll fail?	7	14
No. You have such a rare talent.	7	14
Stop looking over your shoulder at what other people have.	7	14
You don't think I can do it.	7	14
(YELLING) I said the opposite.	7	14
You're just excited about being in charge.	7	14
Working for a producer? That's not even what you do.	7	14
You have no ambition!	7	14
I'm just very happy being good at my job.	7	14
I've got nothing else to prove.	7	14
Spoken like a failure.	7	14
I hope you're really drunk,	7	14
because you're going to need an excuse.	7	14
Stan.	7	14
There's more to life than work.	7	14
Coffee.	7	14
Is the coast clear?	7	14
Who'd you think I was talking to?	7	14
They're gone.	7	14
I could eat a dozen eggs.	7	14
I'm sorry, but I just found out	7	14
I can't go to Old Lyme this afternoon.	7	14
I just wanted you to look at a boat.	7	14
Sounds lovely,	7	14
but Jeffrey says Nathan's Frankfurters	7	14
wants to show me around.	7	14
Coney Island. We can make a day of it.	7	14
It's a business meeting.	7	14
Because you've started a business?	7	14
We'll see.	7	14
What are you doing?	7	14
It's just a couple of little projects.	7	14
Don't you want to be with me?	7	14
Of course.	7	14
But I don't know,	7	14
it seems like this might be a chance to build something.	7	14
It's going to take all your time, all your energy, and all your attention.	7	14
That's not true.	7	14
It is. I did it.	7	14
And you loved it.	7	14
I want to be with you	7	14
and I don't wanna be rooting for you to fail so that can happen.	7	14
Do you want to get married? We can get married.	7	14
(PHONE RINGING)	7	14
No, I don't want to be back where I was.	7	14
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)	7	14
This can be different. We're different people.	7	14
I want you in my life.	7	14
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)	7	14
You really want to answer that, don't you?	7	14
No, but I probably should.	7	14
You act like this is happening to you	7	14
but you're making a choice.	7	14
I can't just turn off that part of myself.	7	14
I would never dream of making you choose.	7	14
When something's wrong, it's always wrong.	7	14
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)	7	14
Hello. Joan Harris speaking. Could you please hold for a second?	7	14
Richard. Wait. You're being silly.	7	14
Good luck, Joan.	7	14
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)	7	14
Well, hello, Jeff. Sorry about that.	7	14
(BIRDS CHIRPING)	7	14
Have you seen Stephanie?	7	14
She took off a few hours ago.	7	14
Did she say where she was going?	7	14
I'm sorry. I would have asked if I'd known you needed to know, man.	7	14
How do I get out of here? My friend took the car.	7	14
We can get you a car and driver with a couple days' notice.	7	14
Or you could hitch,	7	14
but you'll be standing there all day.	7	14
You can thank Charlie Manson for that.	7	14
(SIGHS)	7	14
Damn it.	7	14
I'm sure you can get a ride back with someone by the end of the week.	7	14
You're all paid up.	7	14
People just come and go and no one says goodbye?	7	14
I'm sorry, but people are free to come and go as they please.	7	14
I have a person-to-person call for Peggy Olson	7	14
from Donald Draper.	7	14
This is Peggy Olson. I accept.	7	14
Where the hell are you?	7	14
Somewhere in California.	7	14
Do you know how angry everyone is?	7	14
Did everything fall apart without me?	7	14
It's not about that. You just took off.	7	14
People were worried.	7	14
What have you been doing?	7	14
I don't know.	7	14
I have no idea.	7	14
Look,	7	14
I know you get sick of things and you run,	7	14
but you can come home.	7	14
Where?	7	14
McCann will take you back in a second.	7	14
Apparently, it's happened before.	7	14
Don't you want to work on Coke?	7	14
I can't.	7	14
I can't get out of here.	7	14
Don, come home.	7	14
I messed everything up.	7	14
I'm not the man you think I am.	7	14
Don, listen to me.	7	14
What did you ever do that was so bad?	7	14
I broke all my vows.	7	14
I scandalized my child.	7	14
I took another man's name	7	14
and made,	7	14
nothing of it.	7	14
That's not true.	7	14
I only called because I,	7	14
realized I never said goodbye to you.	7	14
I don't think you should be alone right now.	7	14
I'm in a crowd.	7	14
I just wanted to hear your voice.	7	14
I'll see you soon.	7	14
Wait.	7	14
(CRYING)	7	14
(BREATHING DEEPLY)	7	14
(PHONE RINGING)	7	14
Rizzo.	7	14
It's me.	7	14
What do you want?	7	14
I just got off the phone with Don.	7	14
Are you kidding me? Where the hell is he?	7	14
California.	7	14
But he didn't say where. I'm really worried about him.	7	14
(SIGHS)	7	14
He always does this and he always comes back.	7	14
He's a survivor. He's going to be okay.	7	14
You didn't hear him. He wasn't making any sense.	7	14
You've got to let him go.	7	14
It doesn't mean you stop caring about him.	7	14
I'm sorry I said those shitty things to you.	7	14
I don't believe them.	7	14
Look, you're going to do great no matter what you do.	7	14
I think you were right.	7	14
I mean, I'm going to stay.	7	14
Good, because I didn't want you to leave.	7	14
Then why didn't you just say that?	7	14
Because every time I'm face to face with you,	7	14
I want to strangle you.	7	14
And then I miss you when I go away.	7	14
And I miss you, I call you on the phone,	7	14
and I get the person I want to talk to.	7	14
That's not true.	7	14
Yeah, well, I don't know what it is,	7	14
but when I'm standing in front of you,	7	14
I bring out something terrible.	7	14
I think about how you came into my life	7	14
and how you drove me crazy, and now	7	14
I don't even know what to do with myself	7	14
because all I want to do is be with you.	7	14
What?	7	14
What did you just say?	7	14
I want to be with you.	7	14
I'm in love with you.	7	14
What?	7	14
I love you, P9993'-	7	14
Oh, my God!	7	14
(BREATHING DEEPLY)	7	14
That's what I thought you said.	7	14
(STUTTERING) I don't know what to say.	7	14
I feel like I can't breathe almost.	7	14
I mean, I don't even think about you.	7	14
Uh, I mean, I do all the time,	7	14
because you're there.	7	14
And you're here.	7	14
And you make everything okay.	7	14
You always do.	7	14
No matter what.	7	14
I mean, I must be.	7	14
Because you're always right.	7	14
I can't believe this.	7	14
(WATERY LAUGH)	7	14
I think I'm in love with you, too.	7	14
I really do.	7	14
(SNIFFS)	7	14
Stan?	7	14
Are you there?	7	14
Stan?	7	14
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)	7	14
What were you saying?	7	14
I love you.	7	14
Are you waiting for a phone call?	7	14
What?	7	14
Have you taken something?	7	14
You know what? Why don't you come with me to my seminar?	7	14
I can't move.	7	14
Sure you can. I'm late.	7	14
I don't want to walk in by myself.	7	14
I guess what I feel is I had my hang-ups.	7	14
She had her hang-ups,	7	14
but one of us was willing to reduce the conflict.	7	14
How would you feel about starting with that next time?	7	14
My name's Leonard	7	14
and I don't know if there's anything	7	14
that complicated about me.	7	14
Which is why I should be happier, I guess.	7	14
"Do you remember what I said to Daniel about ""should?"""	7	14
Well, it's good for him. He's interesting.	7	14
But I've never been interesting to anybody.	7	14
I work in an office.	7	14
People walk right by me. I know they don't see me.	7	14
And I go home and I watch my wife and my kids.	7	14
They don't look up when I sit down.	7	14
How does it feel to say that?	7	14
I don't know.	7	14
It's like no one cares that I'm gone.	7	14
They should love me.	7	14
I mean, maybe they do,	7	14
but I don't even know what it is.	7	14
You spend your whole life	7	14
thinking you're not getting it, people aren't giving it to you.	7	14
Then you realize they're trying,	7	14
and you don't even know what it is.	7	14
I had a dream I was on a shelf in the refrigerator.	7	14
Someone closes the door and the light goes off,	7	14
and I know everybody's out there eating.	7	14
And then they open the door and you see them smiling.	7	14
And they're happy to see you,	7	14
but maybe they don't look right at you	7	14
and maybe they don't pick you.	7	14
And then the door closes again.	7	14
The light goes off.	7	14
(SIGHS)	7	14
(LAUGHING TURNS INTO SOBBING)	7	14
Welcome aboard!	7	14
(PHONE RINGING)	7	14
Holloway-Harris. How may I help you?	7	14
Of course. Please hold for Joan.	7	14
This is Joan.	7	14
Look at them. One day that will be us.	7	14
Yeah, tomorrow.	7	14
